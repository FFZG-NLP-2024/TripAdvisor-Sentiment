"I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars. Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive. When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable. I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars. I can't recommend this place unless you're rich and cost doesn't matter much to you.",1,3,2
"What more can you expect from a three-star restaurant ranked fourth in the Ranking than a simply awarded restaurant ? Service was more extensive in the description of the food and the casual Heidi approach does not compare to the classic service of a les trois rois. The food is very good and is enriched with hay flour or pine cone tip; original and timely mentally close to nature. But never comes close to a “damnable” foie gras. All four of us had chosen a 7 course run and even towards the end we did not want an extension of two courses (cheese). Brought and settled 9 courses ! Apart from that, the prices are absolutely fine given the very good quality and staff-intensive service.",3,5,2
