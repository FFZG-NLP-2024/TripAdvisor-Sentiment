"Charmless
If you like a small, open plan hotel where drunken conversations in the lobby at 3am sound like they're right outside your door -- ditto the noisy tour group departing at 6am -- then this is the place for you. Women traveling alone will find that it's better to approach the hotel from the 13th street side so they don't have to run the gauntlet of men hanging around smoking outside the two missions next door on Race Avenue. The picturesque view of the alley behind is just a bonus. In its favour, I'd say the staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful.",1,4,3
"Third time is a charm
Due to our flight delays, we finally arrived to the hotel at 1 am. Our room was on the 7th floor and we didn't have a peaceful night of sleep because the traffic noise was LOUD. We asked for a different room the next morning since our booking was for 5 nights ($200/night plus taxes). The second room smelled horrible, it smelled moldy. We thought if they fix the air condiitoner, then the room might smell ok later. So we went out to do our sight seeing, our first trip to DC! When we came back in the afternoon, the air conditioner was fixed but the mildew and mold odor was very prominent coming from behind the walls. The bathroom vent must have stopped working for months. We really didn't want to ask nor move again, but our health would be in jeorpardy if we had spent one night in that room. We moved to the third room which was acceptable as one would expect from Sheraton...except for the pillows. The front desk attendants were very accommodating. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant the first morning, and if your first cup of coffee is important to you, don't go there.",2,5,3
"Very Nice Surprise
We stayed here for two nights while visiting our family for Easter. We have lived in and visited Chicago many times and had never heard of The Knickerbocker Hotel before. So when Priceline booked us there we were a little concerned about the condition of the hotel. To our surprise the hotel fare xceeded our expectations. As others have said, the location of the hotel is great, the staff is very well trained and friendly and the rooms, while small, are nicely refurbished and very comfortable. We will be sure to check out the Knickerbocker the next time we are in Chicago.",2,5,3
"Great location!
This is great if you are coming to Dallas. They are liberal with upgrades and the concierge at the lounge is amazing. One night, he knew I was coming and had strawberries delivered to my room. Great bar, great location, and the robes are awesome.",1,4,3
"Nice Hotel but not as nice as Vegas
The MGM Detroit is a very nice hotel/casino. It doesn't compare with the Casinos in Vegas and the M-life point rewards are literally insulting for those of you who use M-Life in Vegas. The availability of machines is also less than it should be. They tend to cater to penny players and have older machines. The payback of video poker is one point lower than Vegas and the availability of multi-play video poker machines is very poor. The staff is very gracious, the rooms spotless and you sleep like a baby. They need to upgrade their system to remove smoke to the same level as Vegas the Casino floor can really smell of smoke in Vegas they have that problem solved and did it well.",1,4,3
"Going Above and Beyond
I travel to Chicago for work a lot and tend to stay in the Magnificent Mile area near my office. After a week of that, I spent Friday night downtown to get a broader view of the city. Walking from Mag Mile to downtown, I started getting concerned. The buildings became increasingly decrepit and the roads became increasingly highway like. What was I getting myself into?
I arrived at the hotel way too early... at 11:45 AM. I figured I'd just leave my suitcase in storage and come back later to check in, but Adrian (I believe was her name), told me she would make sure my room was ready quickly. I sat down for less than 10 minutes, when she called me over with a big smile. As she was checking me in, she repeatedly asked me if I needed anything. I had booked on Travelocity and wasn't sure if I had put my priority club info in, but her special treatment led me to believe I did. However, when I decided to ask her, she checked and said it wasn't there. Of course, I didn't know my information, but she told me she'd look it up for me and make sure it was stored.
I went up to my room, and after about 10 minutes, there was a knock. It was Adrian. She had come to tell me she updated the reservation with my club info so I'd get my points. She also brought me a card with my number for reference and showed me how many points I had, informing me I had enough for a free night stay already. She didn't have to do this, but she did and it made the stay that much better.
As for the other things... The neighborhood isn't as bad as it appears. Once you pass a massive complex of post office buildings and cross the river, you're pretty much in the financial district. It's not a far walk to the Art Institute and there's a fair amount going on. The room was large and clean. My checkout experience was also very pleasant. The young woman whose name I didn't catch, ask me how my stay was... I replied that it was great, but she read my face (which was hungover) and implored me to let her know if anything didn't meet my needs. Usually people ask you how your stay was like an automaton and don't even listen to your response. She was actively seeking real feedback. Whoever hires and trains at this hotel is amazing.",5,2,3
"Here's the Real Deal
I stayed here for 2 nights in June on a business trip with two other people. I often come to LA for work and on this occasion the hotel we usually stay at was unavailable, so we were referred to Metro Plaza. I read some of the reviews on tripadvisor before we left, and it didn't sound like it was going to be the nicest hotel I've ever encountered, but most people said it was a good location, good value, clean, and basically that you get what you pay for. After experiencing this ""hotel"" for myself, I have got to tell you the Real Deal. 
Firstly, you most definitiely do NOT get what you pay for. This hotel is just plain expensive, considering that all the hotels in the area are at a similar price point, the Metro Plaza can't justify charging what they do since it's easily the worst in the neighborhood. Secondly, this hotel is very old, very small, and very smelly. We stayed in 2 double queen bed rooms and both of them had rock hard, stained mattresses, disgusting bathrooms (not to the fault of the housekeepers, they probably got them as clean as they could, but how clean can a bathroom be after being used for like, 100 years?), grimy carpets, and the entire hotel has this weird chemical smell, like someone smoked a million cigarettes and then tried to clean the smell out of the walls and carpets with bleach. Don't let the smell of the subway next door fool you (the lobby smells like fresh baked bread). Also, I usually don't care about stuff like this, but the toiletries were REALLY bad. I had to go out to the corner store and buy a bar of soap because they were so bad. Thirdly, the location is not really the best. Yes, it is close to the union station, which is great, and close to chinatown, so lot's of good places to eat, but I was definitely afraid walking around this neighborhood alone, and most of the places around the hotel close before 9pm. Also note that it isn't right IN chinatown as I thought it would be, it's just a short walk away, so I was too afraid to even go that far at night. This neighborhood is boring and convenient at best, dangerous and scary at worst. 
I also would like to comment about the creepy staff. On the first night, upon coming back to the hotel, I stopped at the front desk to ask for more towels (yet another flaw in this hotel, they give you like 2 small towels and then have little signs all over the bathroom telling you not to steal them). And the old, fat guy sitting there grabbed my hand and wouldn't let it go for a very long awkward moment in which he told me how pretty I was. I suppose some people would consider this great customer service, but personally, I wasn't impressed. 
And don't be fooled by the wonderful ""value"" of the free continental breakfast. I will tell you literally what it is: bruised apples and bananas on a plate, an open bag of sliced bread, a toaster (yes, really!), stale coffee in a community thermos, and a 4L jug of milk. The subway next door is no better, we left hungry after standing there for ten minutes waiting for the three people on staff to stop sprinkling cheese on bread so they could serve us, the only customers in the store.",1,5,4
"excellent place to stay
Clean, great service, 24 hour shuttle to airport, affordable, great comfortable beds, would stay again!",2,5,3
"Only pet friendly hotel in DWTN Denver
I travel with my four legged person on occasion and finding a place that lets pets stay too can be a nightmare. 
I have business in Denver three times a year and the Monaco is a great place for several reasons. Here they are:
1. Pet Friendly.
2. Free Wi FI.
3. Well trained staff. (both to humans and animals) :)
4. Close to all activities in DWTN Denver.
5. Very comfy rooms. (just stay away from the noisy elevators)
6. Always have hot water.
7. Excellent free coffee in the morning.
8. Ice cold lemon water in the lobby.
9. Other cool people stay here.
10. A plastic cow.",5,2,3
"Needs a smoking policy, badly! It's a great resort other than that.
Sat on the patio for dinner at a no smoking table only to have three guys sit at the next table who all lit up. All of their smoke drifted across our table. When I complained, the waitress said it was okay for them to smoke there, just not at a table that was marked ""no smoking"" like ours. When we returned to the room, we decided to sit on the patio at our room to enjoy the night weather since it was finally a cool evening. Ten minutes later the guy next door comes out and list up a stinky cigar. When I called the front desk, they said it was okay to smoke on your patio, as long as you shut the door. Heeeelllooooo.........who cares about his room! Ours filled with his stench and bothered us for hours! I stay at Marriots every week and never experienced this before. What's really sad is that this is a really fabulous resort hotel, but the have to get a new smoking policy!",1,5,4
"I'm a beleiver!
I decided to go to Chicago this past weekend for a little business and a little pleasure. EVERYTHING was booked! All along the Mag Mile....Omni, Allerton, etc. etc.....
I'd stayed on the Peninsula years ago but was too green to know a good hotel from a great hotel. But I left today...TOTALLY satisfied, and I am one PICKY SOB. :)
I walked in Saturday to the registration desk and was greeted by Cecilia. I told her I'm in town for the night, don't have a room booked anywhere, and I don't want to pay a LOT of money. Well, she fixed me up with a room, and what was simply the best rate available...no special deals even with my charm and good looks, ha, ha. So....$395, and away I went to a slightly upgraded room. 
It was GREAT. The lighting, the colors, the cleanliness, the unmistakable attention to detail in every inch of the room was like being wrapped in a luxurious warm blanket. It just felt to GOOD! Super comfortable bed, a bathroom fit for a king, nice view, wonderful electronics (A/V, lighting, music, etc.) Five star...all the way.
But here is what is different. I'm indeed used to nice hotels all over the world. But HERE, HERE, I found true customer service in EACH and EVERY employee! The Valet gentleman, the porters, Cecilia at registration, the MAID SERVICE was amazing!!! On this one point, let me elaborate. Each time I left my room (seemingly) I'd return to find my iPad cord wrapped up neatly, my toiletries, arranged label out, towels refreshed, slippers by the bed, plasma screen extended, ice in the bucket, bottle of water by the bed, etc, etc.... WONDERFUL! Our lovely maid from Sierra Leon in Western Africa was a gentle, proper, elegant woman who could NOT have done a better job. It's as though I had a dream about GREAT SERVICE, and thanks to my poor planning by not having a room reserved and serendipitously ending up at the Peninsula, it all came true. It was a pleasant surprise at EACH turn. 
They don't nickel and dime you either. Free WiFi, free coffee, shoe shines, tea, newspaper, and such. I know it's petty to mention that but so often at a hotel, you pay through the nose and then get hit for WiFi. I hate that. And I've NEVER had a free shoe shine. I didn't accept it, but it was all offered. Made me feel like royalty. 
I'm not a rich guy, and really shouldn't spend $395 plus parking and such on a night in a room, but let me say...it WAS worth it. It makes me want to work HARDER in life so I can afford such luxury again and again. 
Plus they're in my FAVORITE cities! Bangkok, Beijing, Paris, LA, NYC, Manila. 
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful in every way. Expensive? A little . Worth it, yep!",5,1,4
"Setai Have Broken my Heart, Ididn't Want To Leave........
Continuing celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary, we booked Suite for 3 nights for the price of 2. 
Pros:
-Very polite, friendly and helpful staff, will go out of their way to ensure your stay is happy.
-Always address by Mrs... or Mr...
-Will accommodate you with the best that's available if capacity too full 
-I like check in and check out any time, but out of consideration for other guests and room service staff, we checked in at 3:00 PM and checked out at 3:00pm again out of consideration for other guests, even though we could have left later and I wanted to. There for since we were busy with other matters, we did everything we planned on our checkout day and were very satisfied to not have missed on anything we planed.
-Non alcoholic drinks in fridge plenty. And what a marvelous idea was to suggest us if we only drink water then they will replenish it only with water, if you need more they will deliver, but we always had enough.
-N espresso is great in the room, I have one home and addicted to it, so if you finish all of the coffee offered, call in the evening and they will deliver you more to have in the morning.
-Quiet rooms so if you meditate, its great/or want to take siesta or fall asleep early, notify front desk not to be disturbed if your sign is on. The only time someone will knock are the fridge/coffee replenish or bring you cookies and will do turn down service if you desire.
-For a suite the accommodation was huge and when the person knocked to deliver ice I was in the bathroom and it was a walk to get to the door, after I opened the door he thought no one was in and was about to leave, I thought that was funny explaining to him that it was a long walk to the door.
-The rooms are well appointed and the decor is pleasant to the eyes. Room and Hotel itself is very clean.
-If you are like me staying in 5 stars hotels the bathroom are pretty much the same in renovated hotels, ours was huge and I loved the window in the bathroom, we've been partying often in there while waiting for my service dog to finish his dinner, he is spoiled and wants us to be around when he its. 
-Two TVs are standard in NYC for suits. And if you never sow TV in the mirror, I somehow felt the screen was bigger than in other hotels.
-Bed is comfortable, so are pillows, I absolutely adored the style of the windows, honestly that was my first choice to stay in Setai, provides with ability to look down without stretching.
your neck. And lower window opens from the top which is less scarier than from the bottom as in Trump Soho.
-If after your room was cleaned and you noticed that something wasn't replenished - a phone call away and a minute of wait.
-If your top cover not on the bed with little neck pillow, it is most likely in the closet.
-Loved the Foyer, Powder room with the door.
-Real walk in room closet.
-Bath tub is for two and the biggest I was in aside from that in Mercer.
-Rain Shower.
-the hotel has Souna and Steam room, Gym, with private room for floor exercise alone or with personal trainer. 
-If you take advantage of their spa, you also receive access to whirl pool, ha-mam, and rain shower from all over top, walls (this kind of shower was my first time experience to see) and plenty of healthy snack and fruits and drinks. The spa person will be more than happy to give you the tour. We did the tour of the hotel while waiting for our room cleaned.
-We didn't use the bar or restaurant, because my husband already planned the places to eat ahead of arrival and it is his department. If you are like us who enjoy rather unquiet ambiance the kind that no one can hear your conversation we liked Dallas and Irish Pub a block away. We drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, but the day of our check out we walked over to Barking Dog which is famous for their Pancakes which I like and my husband ordered eggs and mixed breakfast meats.plate. Don't order toast, it comes with the good size bun.
-Places to see Bryant Park, always something going on there, there is a watering whole and instead of benches there are chairs and tables. Which are scattered all over and you can find private spot to enjoy and then move to another spot that is what we were doing. I also think the chairs for the reason that a person don't make a bed out of it. Park is opened until 9PM. Security is present. Oh and they also have ping pong table there to rent.
-Library a must see, I've been there many times when I was studying in University. But being there as a tourist is not the same experience, things I missed. They always have something in the exhibition room that is unique theme. 
-AC is quiet and works perfect with 3 room temperature thermostats.
-Not like I ever seen in other hotels the channels managary is organized in sections, where each section of channels is listed in TV guide with consecutive numbers. I don't recall seeing such in other hotels.
Cons: non I can think of. If you are experienced traveler you know what to do, if you are not, don't upset yourself with something that wasn't done the way you expected, just ask they are there to ensure you leave Setai Happy. 
-Suites are expensive, but once you try one you cannot go below, but in my opinion there is nothing like staying in the suit. But if you are in New York Sight Seeing and believe me you will be disappointing not booking longer stay, but even if it is longer stay you still will not have enough days to see all. We've been coming to NYC on vacation 12 times and still didn't see everything we wanted to see. But since we are local we mostly come to enjoy the room and the view is the top priority for me.
-I wish we could have stayed on the higher floor that would really complete our joy.
From my experience if you come with the right attitude you will do your self and your health a lot of good and will only bring good memories back. This worked in every hotel in NYC we stayed at, except Soho Trump with the staff there Guaranteed to ruin not just your stay but entire vacation, and you will stay 5 categories below of the room you reserved in SohoTrum for the price double of what you pay in Setai.",5,1,4
"nice place business or pleasure
i use this hotel for business really nice place breakfast was great and they have a nice lazy pool",5,2,3
"Bar Person Tried to ban me from the hotel for asking DIRECTIONS
I was so happy to see your hotel on Sunday night. I have stayed many times in NC and FL at A Loft Hotels.
When I checked in last night I was given room 410 - I think this room was maybe not ready for a guest, but this was the best of your hotel.
Woke up this morning for a long 12 hour day, your ""person"" on the desk could not even pick her head up to say ""coffee machine is broken""
Came back at 6:45pm to sit at the bat and meet me most ignorant staff member I have ever come across in any hotel 
""can I get a beer please"" She looked at me like I was a killer. I got my beer..... ""can you tell me where Capital Grill is or Fogo de Chao"" to be told - we have a computer for that. ""can you tell me if their is a decent steak restaurant round here"" to be told - I am busy cleaning and don't have time for you. I replied with 'how do you speak to a customer like this"" only to be told I will have you removed from the hotel. 
I asked for the manager, a very nice lady who listened about everything, only to tell me she had been here a week. 
Is this how you teach your staff to treat customers?
Checking out of the hotel at 5:30am after two very poor nights, the reception area was empty - The man working that area stood outside by the pool smoking. His attiture sums up this hotel.

"WoW ! Great Experience/ Great Price
20 yrs. ago this place was a place you wouldn't let your dog stay overnight, we had checked in, went to our room and checked right out, it was that bad.....then. 
 I was reluctant but they offered a wonderful medical discount (my brother had a day surgery) and they were nearby, they even waived the parking fee and had a free shuttle to all the destinations we wanted to go. 
 As soon as I walked in the ambiance was like home, a great room so warm and friendly just like their staff. All the amenaties (hot tub and pool were delightful). The marble bathroom was an exceptional change, the bedding was classic comfort and the pillows were to die for, my bro. asked me if I could find him a few of those. They say they are still in renovation mode, I can't imagine it getting any better! The price with the discount was a huge plus as we had to travel so far to get there and back, even without a discount it's a killer deal, measures up to any 5 star hotel I've ever been in and they have even more luxurious suites than the simple Dbl. bed we chose, Those prices are the best I have seen in Seattle for such comfort, do check out the virtual tour, I had no idea they offered that online as I was in a hurry to find a place, last minute. I got home, clicked on the virtual tour and it is EXACTLY WHAT YOU VIEW on the tour, no phoney trick to get you there, you get what you see and much more. Don't pass this place by, you will miss out on a great experience. 
 Nice job Cody and staff, you are now my and all my friends &families go to place when we want or need to be in Seattle!! (we even had the space needle as our view OMG, breathtaking at night). The entire staff was amazing, really!!!
 You will never regret booking with this hotel, I assure you. I just learned, my cousin from California has booked with them the last 2 yrs. for a week at a time and she agrees with everything I have written, she's sorry she didn't do it herself. 
 Looking forward to our next visit, thanks so much John St. Suites, it was a delightful time just hanging around.",1,5,4
"hotel from hell????? definately NOT!
after reading all the negative reviews on this hotel, i wondered what i was getting myself into.......... may i say ""i was pleasantly surprised............cost very little, staff really nice, bed changed 3 times in 1 week, stones throw away from times square..........i will definately go back and would recomend it to everyone.",4,1,3
