"great and friendly experience
i recently had the pleasure to visit the gansevoort park ave hotel a few weeks ago and i have to say it was an amazing hotel first off when you walk into the lobby its quite a different vibe  great rock n roll music playing purple chandeliers and very modern furniture everywhere 
the rooms are very large for new york city and i love the separate tub and showers in the bathroom the artwork in the room is impressive as it is a little bit more provocative  always intriguing but if youre worried about people who maybe shouldnt be seeing anything provocative ie children i learned that they can flip all of the art to reveal different neutral artwork for kids or more conservative clients that part really impressed me because it shows that the hotel really cares about all of their guests not just a certain type of clientele 
the service is better than i thought it would be for a hotel that seems more geared to a younger crowd chris at the front desk was amazing he gave me great directions on how to get to the hotel and even recommended a great place for dessert right around the corner although i never had breakfast or room service there is a great place across the street called bread and butter i did get to try the main restaurant asselina though during happy hour and i was quite impressed with the food and the design of the entire place unfortunately i didnt get to go for a swim which was a disappointment because they have an amazing rooftop pool that is partially indoors and partially outdoors 
im looking forward to my next trip back to nyc and my next visit to the gansevoort",5.0,4,-1.0,1.0
"one of the worst experiences ever
we had the unfortunate opportunity to stay at the hilton garden inn denver tech center on june  the hotel had booked a group of youth soccer teams in the hotel without advising the other cleints that the hotel would be overrun with children we had to move our room due to the noise the public rooms were overriun with children the poolthe excercise room and the business center were overtaken by children shameful as the hotel was not prepared for the amount of children so basically we our room as the only quiet area spoke to management but unfortunately there is not much they can do unfortunate as we are gold hilton members and this hotel has let us down in every way",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

"consider the parking a tax
we recently stayed at the downtown austin hampton inn and suites for five nights choosing it primarily because of location and reviews on ta although valet parking can be a nice convenience it is rather irritating when the hotel makes it so difficult to self park that you have no option
we expected to pay a bit more than usual for this type property because several events were underway in austin but i think it is over priced for what you get and the property is tired i really appreciated the enthusiasm and helpfulness of the staff but they had a lot to overcome
the breakfasts were good too but the gratis happy hour is only for those who are interested in the act of imbibing alcohol and not caring what they drink",2.0,3,1.0,1.0

im an omni select guest black level member however i had the worst experience while on a last trip with my terminally ill brotherinlaw and his two small children i had to make  separate request to obtain a refrigerator for medications thiss item is on my profile and at all other properties the refrigerator is already in my room when i check in i contacted the loyalty ambassadorconcierge to insure my two rooms were adjoining to provide care for my two small nephews i never received a response or had my request acknowledged in addition my keys were not ready per the normal express checkin method 
at turndown i was provided with one milk and cookie even though the two children were clearly on my portfolio and had to call down and request an additional milk and cookie someone charged a  bar tab and i had to dispute it twice before it was finally removed upon checkout i went downstairs to obtain a copy of my receipts to indicate the credit for the bar tab and the young lady at the front desk was rude and condescending and irritated that i made her reprint my receipts",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

my wife and i stayed here for the first time for the nights of the rd and th of july our room was on the th floor we were amused by the funky black shutter doors  sort of giving the place a southern feel in reading many of the previous reviews it looks like they have quite a variety of rooms we had a king bed room but there was no refrigerator or kitchenette fortunately we had a cooler with us to keep some beverages and snacks cold but we had to call the front desk to have ice delivered to the room  there is no ice machine available for guests also there was no ice bucket so i dont know where youd keep the ice if you didnt bring a cooler the bathroom was very small and only had a narrow shelf above the sink and toilet on which to keep our stuff there were a few rough edges in the preparation of the room when we checked in there was only one bath towel fortunately there was a maid right outside and she gave us a couple more also while there was an iron in the closet we had to request an ironing board despite these shortcomings the staff were all very friendly and helpful there is evening turndown service where they close the curtains turn on a light and drop off a couple of bottles of water because we had showered after returning from a hot day at nationals stadium we even had our towels replaced when the maid visited the room the air conditioner was fairly quiet and there was a ceiling fan over the bed to help move the cool air around the bed was very comfortable and there was an abundance of pillows the location is great  our walk to the mall for fireworks only took about  minutes the dc circulator buses stop very near by and are only  with free tranfers within a twohour period the front desk gave us a map of the routes",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0

"small room and no noise insulation
we just spent  nights in this hotel it was the first hotel that we have stayed in the usa we booked it based on tripadvisor reviews overall the experience was just acceptable compared to previous hotels which we had stayed in first of all
pros
efficient check in and out
polite staff
good central location a short walk to the metro
comfortable bed
cons
small rooms  not sure if it was standard dc size or because we secured a discounted rate via hotel travelcom
no noise insulation  could hear people talking outside the room in the corridors especially after midnight can hear the tv from the next room it woke me up from sleep  times during our last night

"horrible stay and horrible meeting
booked a meeting with  sleeping rooms and an all day meeting at the hotel they screwed up the rooming list and blamed us until they found they updated list that they never entered told participants they didnt have reservations hotel was full they would have to find somewhere else to stay some were checked in and then found that their rooms were dirty and never cleaned after the last guest checked out
the sleeping rooms were musty and old bathroom fixtures all chipped and stained as previous posters have said the air conditioning leaves alot to be desired i had it set to  and it never ever got close to that the att wifi in the rooms was down more than it was up they blamed att the toilet in my room had a dripping noise that didnt stop for  days 
for the meeting in the ballroom the food was the only positive breakfast and lunch were good that being said the room was a mess when they set it up several of the linens on the tables were stained and dirty 
overall cant believe how bad this hotel was not only was the facility disgraceful the level of service was unbelievably bad at every corner the hotel staff didnt care they said it was our fault or just simply moved on only after speaking with the hotel manager did i see any results that being said i saw her in the hallway the next day and she averted eye contact and didnt even acknowledge me or ask how our meeting was going
they did mention they are about to renovate that might help the facility  but they need to renovate the staff a bit as they were rude beyond belief

not a bad hotel walk in the front door and its got that typical courtyard look with included bistro restaurant so you know what youre getting into the staff was really nice and talkative and makes you feel welcome layout of the property is pretty standard courtyardunfortunately i drew the room at the far back end of the hotel  it wasnt bad just all the way at the back 
room was standard double queen roomwith a small bathroom but liveable the only real problem i had with the room was the volume button on the remote didnt work no problemthere are controls on the side of the tv i had no refrigerator nor microwave in my room  that seemed a little strange so i was forced to go to the bistro i dont mind the bistro except its way to expensive for the qualityquantity of such a captive audienceim not just saying here but at all courtyards i really wish they would fix this

"cookies to kill for
doubletrees slogan is where the little things mean everything while their intent is surely to imply that their attention to detail offers a superior hotel experience it should be noted that the converse is also true when little things are overlooked over and over again it adds up to a pretty annoying stay 
start with arrival  women on a trip carry a lot of luggage we pulled up to the front so that we could unload our bags prior to parking the car my friend went inside and took the elevator up to the lobby to request a bellhop the person behind the desk pointed to a luggage cart and said you can use this 
so after tipping my friend  for loading the bags we went to park the car the facade of the hotel is on s front street in columbus that is where you enter on the same block just down the street is a parking garage which one would assume is where guests at the doubletree would park being the only parking garage anywhere near the hotel we parked when we entered the elevator and saw no indication of buttons leading to a hotel lobby we figured out we were at the wrong place we headed down to street level and walked up the block to the hotel entrance doubletrees defense the parking garage had no signage indicating that it was doubletree parking in our defense it had no signage indicating that it wasnt we later find out the the actual doubletree parking is in fact around the corner from the entrance not just down the street from the entrance here is where a sign at the main entrance stating doubletree parking around the corner would have been most helpful 
upon check in we neither asked for nor received the signature chocolate chip cookie that doubletree hangs its hat on our room was a decent suite with the bedding being the most standout feature of the room the outlets were poorly accessible with an outlet in the lamp base nearly shorting out my phone there were ample towels and the room appeared clean if not a bit dated 
the next morning we pulled out of the wrong parking garage and were asked for our parking voucher from the hotel what parking voucher exactly i imagine our chocolate chip cookies were somewhere wrapped in the parking voucher we paid the full price and decided to deal with the parking issue upon our return as we had an appointment to get to 
upon return to the hotel we went to the front desk to rectify the parking snafu the woman explained that we should have asked for the voucher when we checked in we explained that they should have presented the voucher to us along with the cookies when we checked in sensing a stalemate the clerk waived the parking fee for the prior night and presented us with the necessary parking vouchers for the following day 
but what about the cookies as we wrapped up the parking predicament a cookie sounded like a delicious idea lamenting diplomatically that we had missed out on the cookies the night before would the clerk mind providing some now oh if only she could were out of cookies she said with a shrug see here is where a little thing like but ill be sure to send some up to your room as soon as we get more would mean everything no were out of cookies when we expressed disbelief that a hotel chain that features said cookie prominently on its literature in its ads and on its website would be unable to provide the lure the clerk shrugged again and said people kill for those cookies im not sure if that was meant to be an explanation as to why there were no cookies or a hint as to how we could procure some for ourselves at any rate no cookie 
the next morning at checkout the lobby was a buzz of hysteria apparently there had been a rash of breakins in the right doubletree parking lot windshields smashed property stolen glass everywhere the clerk same one from the previous night clearly on a  hour shift seemed dejected but not defeated she remained calm cool and polite even as we four parking perpetrators approached her station to check out her only concern was whether we too had been broken into we hadnt she heaved a sigh of relief checked us out and handed over  chocolate chip cookies still warm",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

generally this location is what you would expect from a hampton inn the rooms are clean albeit somewhat small since this is nyc after all the staff are friendly the included breakfast is pretty much what youd get at any other hampton inn edible but nothing to write home about the prices are usually pretty good for nyc weekdays are sometimes on the high side as the hotel is close enough to the financial district to get some business traveler spillover
theyve gone somewhat overboard with the cushiness of the mattresses i dont recall if thats true of other hampton inn locations

the biggest complaint is that the place is fairly noisy  we heard doors slamming shut frequently especially in the morning when people were going in and out of the rooms a lot its not surprising as the doors have absolutely no cushioning between them and the door jamb its metalonmetal for the hallway doors and woodonmetal for the bathroom doors and yes we could hear bathroom doors in rooms down the hall slamming shut a little rubber or felt strip on the door jamb would go a long long way to quieting the place down we mentioned the problem when we checked out and hopefully this will get fixed until then well be looking for a different place to stay on out next trip to nyc",2.0,3,1.0,1.0

where to start i spent  nights at this hotel and i really wish i had not i wish i had stayed at the hyatt next door i will start with the room in my room i shared this room with my sister in law the air conditioner was acting funny and there were sounds of electrical spark and it sounded very unsafe i called up the front desk about the issue and they sent up a maintenance man who just smiled as we were explaining what was going on and then tried to explain to us how to use an air conditioner as if we have never stayed at a hotel that has that same kind of air conditioner and it was in a very condescending tone after i told him he did not have to speak to me in that tone and that i was a smart woman and new how to use an air conditioner and that he was not listening to what i was saying he laughed and then pretended to look at the unit as he was doing this he got another call about a gas leak on the same floor let me just say how unsafe i felt he did absolutely nothing and i had to usher him out of my room when he said there was nothing wrong he just stood there and tried again to tell me how to use the an air conditioner when asked to leave he still kept standing their smiling it was all very creepy 
this hotel offers free kits they really should not because they never got them right during our stay i pre ordered my kits  weeks prior to my stay i requested two as there are two people in the room and we are not a couple i ordered the walking tour and there was nothing in it no maps no ipod or nano just  bottle of water and that was it what a waste when i told them at the front desk about it they said they could bring me a new one later we where headed out as we did not have a lot of time for sightseeing we where there for family reasons i requested the byob kit and requested two wine cases as we and our family were going wine tasting and we may by more than two bottles of wine i told them them we were leaving in the morning and we would like it ready for then they said no problem it would be in our room waiting we got back from sightseeing without the kit and dinner when we got to our room there was no kit i called the front desk who said everything would be there and the kit would be completed and told them it was not here they told me they could not do it and that they could have it ready for me in the morning i asked if i could pick it up on my way out in the morning at am at the front desk they told me that would be fine at am i went down to pick up the items and leave for the day and it was not there they told me if i wanted to way  minutes they could have it ready for me i did not have time to wait so no kit if your going to offer something as part of your experience at their hotel they should be more on the ball with it 
finally my bill i had found a rate of  per night i asked if they priced matched i was told no when actually looking further on their website i found out that they do i called back and i was told the best they could do for my room was  a night an that the price was non refundable and that i would have to pay now for it i said that was not a problem and they charged my credit card my sister in law got to the hotel before me and she checked in they took her credit card and told her it was for incidentals we got our bill at check out and they charged her credit card for our stay so they billed us twice once on my credit card and once on hers after telling her they were only taking her credit card number for incidentals i got on the phone right away with the front desk at this point i was very very displeased with our service the lack of customer service and the fact that i did not feel safe in my room any longer i was told they could give me a breakfast i declined the breakfast as i did not have time to sit and eat breakfast i had a plane to catch she said she would have the manager contact me as i was getting ready to go the manager called up to the room and wanted to know what he could do he cut me off and said well i will take  off a night i found this rude as i was not done with what i had to say and told him to hold on a moment as there is more then he proceeded to tell me that he had another customer and that he would have to call me back this was completely rude why is that customer more important than me why does that customer deserve his attention and my concerns and issues are not as important to him this is bad really bad customer services and i feel he should not be the manager any longer i told him to contact me at my home i had a plane to catch because of this i missed my train to the bwi airport and had to take a more expensive train to get to my flight in time for take off so it cost me more money because of their lack of customer care and lies i feel lied to and cheated i called back quickly because i did not realize that my sister in law was leaving later and she really wanted breakfast i was told that it was non transferable and that she would not get the breakfast i was so upset that i told her that she is listed on my room and they still told me it was not transferable i told her that this was highly unacceptable she said fine i will giver her the breakfast but she has to sign for it and then they will take it off the bill i said fine i had to leave she order her meal and it was the most greases and disgusting meal she wished she had not ordered it

service good and friendly faces throughout
rooms all renovated overall so the quality is good with new furnishings room size is good and the bed is comfortable there is an iphone dock that serves as an alarm clock the bathroom does not have a tub but just a large shower large flat screen tv is the standard these days runway noise was not noticeable
breakfast booked on a corporate rate that included buffet breakfast normal rate is around  quality is decent the omelette station does a good job and the fruit selection was excellent cereal selection could have been improved though hyatt place is better in that area coffee tasted diluted and poor

"a crack in the hyatt reputation oh dear
i was excited to stay at this brand spankin new hyatt house and booked it without hesitation for both nights of my inbound and outbound flights from the nearby airport my excitement soon waned the hotel is in a shopping center that is somewhat still under construction when i entered the hotel i found it to be very attracted and decorated in a retro stylethe registration desk was well staffed one person was answer a phone call someone had left behind a stuffed animal and no the housekeeping staff had not turned it in the thought ran across my mind that i had better keep a close watch on my things here that things dont get turned in to lost and found the other person at the desk checked me in and gave me a key to my room the drive to the hotel was several hours for me and i was looking forward to getting up to my room and having a long soak in a hot bath but first you have to go back out to your car and put a parking pass in your car window i found this inconvenient as i am traveling solo carrying all my own luggage if they had emailed me the parking pass i could have done that before i came in the first time or if i had known about this parking pass exercise i could have left my luggage and brought it in the second trip instead of lugging it back and forth up and down curbs twice as many times as i needed to very thoughtless and inefficient of them not something hyatt is usually known for once i got back into the hotel a second time i headed into the elevator and didnt realized they were fancysmancy elevators that required you to use your room key to operate them it would have been kind of the reception desk to point this out since it still isnt common practice at least in my experience for this to be the case of most elevators i did think it was a nice safety feature having to go to the reception desk to ask how to work the elevator was embarrassing and it was now taking a very long time to simply get to my room the bathroom was unusual in three ways first there is only a walk in shower no bathtub second the shampoo isnt the tiny little bottles but a large bottle attached to the wall with a tiny pump to pump out the shampoo ditto for the shower gel the third unusual thing is that a full tube of toothpaste is provided the bed is comfortable it has a down type comforter in a duvet cover so you if that is too hot for you there isnt the option of just sleeping with a sheet you also dont have much of a range of control in the temperature of the air conditioning it wont go lower than  degrees check out time is noon the signs in the parking area say you cant part there after  i dont what you are expected to do with you car after  now mind you  all this stuff can be lived with heres what cannot and it echos back to the very first stuffed animal thing i accidently left my carry on bag of very nice item i had bought in hawaii in my room and guess what housekeeping never turned them in to lost and found when i called the hotel i was told that housekeeping supervisor saw them in my room and thought i hadnt check out yet then when the housekeeper went to clean my room later in the day they didnt see them vanishing stuffed animals and bags left in rooms by mistake rather than being turned in to lost and found rates this hotel terrible for me its a pity i have stayed at and have loved hyatts for decades all over the world",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

check in was quick and painless and i was able to get my room even though i was there  minutes before check in time my key didnt work but i went back to the front desk and got a new one no great inconvenience there the room was functional though its missing some of the amenities in just about every other place ive stayed no hair dryer no ironironing board and no coffee maker apparently some rooms have fridges and microwaves but not mine they are updating some rooms though based on the comments here this seems to be a continuous work in progress
as for the noise i wasnt really affected by it yes there are railroad tracks right behind the hotel and the airport is close by and you will hear the noise but they didnt bother me
the continental breakfast consisted of individually wrapped bagels and danishes fruit coffee and cereal if that isnt enough for you theres a jack in the box next door and a dennys up the street

"decent but not up to hilton standards
i am by no means an expert in hilton hotels i have stayed at  in  different states however i do travel extensively and would consider myself somewhat experienced when it comes to hotels the reasons i cant give the millenium hilton higher marks are as follows
front desk staff this was the one highlight i had the staff at the front desk and the supporting staff were great very friendly and they had my requests on record and happily fulfilled them
pool and gym a rare find in this city the pool and gym are great by all standards if this is important then you cant go with this hotel
rooms the room was clean but felt dark you cant expect any hotel to have rooms of any great size so i wouldnt take points off for that
concierge lounge as a frequent traveler i depend greatly on the concierge lounge this hotel doesnt have one to me this is a huge deal breaker
restaurants the restaurant was good the staff is very friendly and helpful however the bar is right by the elevators i was traveling with my family and i didnt really care for the atmosphere for my kids
location great i cant say much about that 
overall if i was traveling alone i may have given it an extra point but i was with my family i did not want to stay there with my kids hilton hotels and staff are great but the layout of the entrance didnt make it very kid friendly there is nothing i enjoy more than to relax in the concierge lounge of a hotel after a long day of work but this hotel doesnt have one it is truly a shame",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0

this time the rooms had been newly decorated and were very bright an pleasant with modern fittings but only one bathroom
the bedroom had two spot lamps in the ceiling  both did not work also the sofa bed which had been previously made up on arrival was not nor did it have any sheets available for us to make the bed up the bathroom also only had towels for two
i went downstairs to discuss this with reception the lady i spoke to was a little put out with what i had to say and that someone would be up to put things right in mins one and a half hours later still no sign

the elevators took a very long time to come when you needed them the food was not bad nor good i would not recommend having a meal at the hotels restaurant the breakfast buffette was scarce and if they ran out of something they would not refill it service took forever as well
also when we checked in we specifically told the lady we did not want the bill charged to the credit card we had provided upon reservation at check out it was already charged to the credit card this was quite inconvenient for us

"in need of some major tlc
i was in phoenix on business and decided to stay at the biltmore from the moment i arrived things seemed a little odd from the series of construction cones and detours that led me to the hotel to the rushed valet greeting things got progressively stranger
i entered the hotel and proceeded to the checkin desk they found my reservation in the computer and then mentioned they had a letter for me the guy at the front desk then made a presentation out of going into the back room and coming out with a welcome note formletter from management thanking me for choosing the biltmore ive had this before at other hotels and i understand they are trying to make the guest feel special but it actually just prolongs the checkin process 
what made the letter bizarre was not the staged letter ceremony but the fact that it didnt mention the room upgrade i was given without any notification in the letter nor by the desk clerk i would think that if the hotel wanted to make me feel special they would have merchandised this at the time of checkin who doesnt like a room upgrade into a suite it wasnt until i got to my room i noticed the upgrade
so i get into the room and tour the space a good sized living room with a fireplace a dining nook and a separate kitchenette the room also had tall ceilings with large windows overlooking one of the pools the bedroom had a king bed and a bathroom with a dual vanity separate shower and sunken tub the toilet was in a separate little room there was a large walkin closet most of these elements i love in a hotel room except for the kitchenette which makes me think of an extended stay motel
at first glance i did see that the decor was a little dated too many mirrors old fixtures and electronics a missing phone in the bathroom etc i had read reviews that also mentioned this and sure enough it was an accurate assessment i was only there for one night so i could dealso i thought
i was meeting some friends for drinks and needed to get cleaned up i went into the bathroom and noticed that one of the sinks was running water did housekeeping accidentally leave it on i tried to turn it off but it was a thin yet steady streamnot just a dripcoming out of the faucet
i then turned on the shower and noticed that there was no real shower head on the pipe water sprayed out all over the floor as i tried to adjust the pipe so i could take a very cold shower i didnt have much time so i got ready and left i should have called maintenance but since there was no room safe to lock up my computer equipment i didnt want anyone in the room without me there plus i was running behind and would deal with this later
so i returned to the room around p and ordered some room service after a very mediocre burger i start working to prep for my meetings the next morning since half of the lights in the living room didnt work including the fixture over the dining table all i had to work off of was the light from computer screen this frustration cased me to forget the faucet issues in the bathroom
around a i decide to head into the bedroom and get some rest since the faucet issue was not a loud drip the sound wasnt going to keep me up all night if i closed the bathroom door so i decided to just deal with it rather than wait for someone to come and fix it i tried to turn off the water source but the pipe was too corroded and i couldnt turn it off
so im in bed watching tv on an old set that needed replacement i turn the tv off and i can the hear people in the room below me hanging out and drinking on their patio a few minutes later my room started to shake sounding like a helicopter was landing on the roof the sound and vibration lasted for about minutes and then finally stopped but the people downstairs were still there so the noise was replaced with another one not to worry cause  minutes later the loud vibration was back this continued for about an hour until i had enough
i called the front desk and requested to be moved into a new room nothing like changing rooms at a when all you can think about are important meetings the next day
so a bellman arrives to my room with the key to my replacement room this new room was not a suite and was actually a room class below my original reservation i pack my bag and move in the dark of night like im skipping out on the landlord i get to my new very small room it was much more quiet and actually had a real shower head and faucets that turn on and off it was not until the next morning when i noticed the worn nature of that room missing sections of wallpaper and moldy grout in the bathroom etc
i check out of the hotel around am on the way to the lobby i walked past my old room i then realized what the sound was the night before it was coming from a neighboring pool structure housing ac compression units or pool pumping systems 
while checking out not once did i receive a how was your stay or sorry about the conditions of our aging resort from the staff member checking me out not even when i made a comment about my displeasure with the resort did i hear an im sorry the only person who asked how my stay was was the valet who brought my car
as a business traveler i could endure more in terms of a poor experience at a hotel  resort if i was traveling with my family on my own dime or designi would have been much more confrontational about the experience

staff  the staff cleaning ladies front desk clerk breakfast clerk are very friendly and helpful each day they wished me a good morning or evening with a smile
breakfast kitchen  they really didnt have a large variety of breakfast items to choose from they had small egg ham cheese type bagel for both days for hot food they served the usual oatmeal boxed cereals milk   skim and orangeapple juices in plastic pitchers to keep them cold they where sitting on an ice cold surface unfortunately this only cooled the bottom of the container i like my juices refrigerator cold and the drinks here where cool at best they could do better keeping the beverages colder they did have donutsdanishes but donuts for breakfast i did see people helping themselves but maybe im a bit too health conscious they also had fruits

i am always super worried when i find a seemingly great hotel at a great rate in a great location but this hotel truly surprised usin a good way

we snagged a spacious king room that by many other chains would be considered a junior suite there was a massive king bed separate sitting area lots of work space wet bar makeup counter and very scandinavian bathroom that i absolutely loved the shower
needless to say you are in an absolutely fantastic location we parked our car the day we arrived and didnt go back to it until we were leaving seattle everything is within walking distance no need to take transit either there is an excellent greek restaurant on the main lobby floor that we ate at a few times even just for a quick beersnack between our ventures around the city
even though the hotel was quite busy it never reflected poorly in the service we were well taken care of from checkin to check out make sure you also take some time to check out the library in the lobby kick back by the fireplace and enjoy a glass of wine served straight to you from lola

 wasnt getting channel  in the room  thats the olympics channel  called maintenance and was told it wasnt possible was told that the wiring in the building let some rooms see channel  and others couldnt  so i missed a lot  miraculously the issue was fixed after complaining a fourth timeseems the wiring is fine
 the phone flashed all of the time but there were never any messages  ever was told to pull the plug out and put it back in  is that really the solution
 no room service menu in the room or on the fancy ipad which baffles me called  times and it never arrived finally called the restaurant and they recited the menu until i found something that sounded edible when food showed up i was told that housekeeping had the menus and thus the delay i did ask yes but isnt there a restaurant in the hotel with menus to which i got a nonanswer answer
 drinks arent served on the lobby floor patio  which makes no sense
 was told the rooftop bar wasnt for guests  that id have to get dressed up and wait in line for the privilege for a cocktail in my own hotel
 understand they cant serve alcohol on the street level patio  but how about juice i sat out there for  hours one night and was never offered a glass of water
 ipad  the ipad in the room should if it were intelligent contain the room service menu local restaurant listsguides shopping guides etc  it doesnt  its a barely formatted ipad which defies all marketing logic
 came to the room and the door wouldnt open  took  engineers and my mother making a lot of noise to get it solved quickly
staff were extremely apologetic every time and in the end the hotel compd my ride to the airportwhich is all fine but i prefer to stay in hotels where i dont have to hear im very sorry every day for what i consider to be service basics

we flew in to houston hobby for one night pre cruise we had read other reports to avoid staying near the airport due to undesireable location but it worked best for us and timing of flights in grandma flying in  hours before us and we wanted her to be able to check in without us her finding transportation independently to galveston was not desireable 
we made an excellent choice she easily caught the free shuttle and checked in and we rented a minivan and checked in  hours later the hotel was clean  comfortable all of the staff that we encountered were wonderful  pleasant we only needed one of our  bags for the night but did opt to bring in all our luggage from the minivan as we didnt want to present the opportunity for a car break in but we felt swawfe  comfortable staying at the location we had free wifi but we are spg so not sure if it is free for all would highly recommend staying here the entrance was easy to find not sure why it was an issue for others that posted",5.0,5,0.0,0.0

as others have stated this hotel looks beautiful when you walk in it is close to the river walk and the alamo and across the street from a small park so despite some shadylooking spots immediately near the hotel overall its a great location lots of wonderful restaurants within walking distance 
 i love the fact that its an old building and would overlook imperfections for that reason however thats no excuse for poor cleaning all of the rugs in the hallways and in our room needed a thorough cleaning there were stains all over them we had a broken towel bar and a broken toilet paper holder in our room and the sink backed up i reported all  items but by the time we left on day  only the tp holder had been fixed there were also blood stains or something brownish red anyway on the wall that never got cleaned although we reported that too ill say that the bed was wonderful  a big cushy poster with nice linens but then the bath towels were thin and worn 
some of the service was very good and there were some bad experiences i ordered a salad in petes pub the hotels tavern and it took  minutes to arrive i was told that they were busy with a banquet upstairs but shouldnt they staff accordingly however the next morning breakfast was served very quickly and was delicious my breakfast waiter was attentive and courteous there are  places to eat the lobby bar petes pub and the madrid yet all  had the same menu for the most part with just a few selections burger salads soup and sandwiches so there is no fine dining in the hotel which i thought was strange 
during our stay the hotel was swamped with two big conferences so there was always a crowd at the front desk yet i never saw more than two people working the desk the desk clerks were frazzled and sometimes a little cranky 
this could easily be a  star hotel the history and architecture are wonderful but it is under staffed the restaurants need to overhaul their menus and the housekeeping is lacking with some proper management this could be the premier hotel in san antonio but its lacking some key elements",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

i had a horrible experience at this hotel first of all they didnt give us the right room because the room we reserved had been damaged by a sprinkler leak so we got a room with two queen beds instead of one king bed that was the only good thing about this experience
in the replacement room the edge of the carpet in the bathroom doorway was shredded and pulled back a bit leaving exposed tacks with the points sticking straight up we covered it with a towel and decided we would be fine with it instead of asking for a different room my four year old daughter ended up slipping on a wet tile after getting out of the tub and sliced herself halfway down her leg on those tacks matter of fact it was room  if you get this room and have small children please dont make my mistake go get a different room
on top of that the doors have no childproofing and can be opened very easily by a small child we had to move the table in front of the door to be able to sleep without worrying about our daughter going outside if she woke while we were sleeping those doors should have a chain lock up out of a childs reach this is a terrifying danger with the hotel being just off i  i will never go to this hotel again just because of this

we stayed in the le meridien to attend a meeting in the conference center one block away as many have written it is the old ymca converted in a nice modern hotel upon arrival you first see the modern bar and seating areas rather the a row of checkin counters quite refreshing the checkin and elevators are not hard to find at all in contrast to an earlier review immediately left upon entrance as the doormen will tell you only renovated  years ago everything looks new and modern 
check in was pleasant we received an upgrade to a suite on the th floor nd and th are missing with a view of city hall the hallways feel a bit like a maze but it is much nicer than the usual straight hallways and no doubt helps reduce noise in the rooms the bathroom is well appointed only drawback is a soapshampoo holder placed on the long wall of the shower instead of under or across from the shower head providing you the opportunity to hit it and hurt yourself
the bed is comfortable and you have the opportunity to forgo housekeeping and instead receive starwood points or a  credit for the bar make sure to ask at checkout if you choose the former im still waiting for a  day housekeeping credit despite asking for confirmation at checkout 
a nice room feature is a lockbox with an outlet on the inside of the door allowing you to charge your phonelaptop etc while locked away the furniture is modern and comfortable the latter often not the case and not so important if you only sleep in the room but if you do some work and dont want to sit at the desk it does matter
the restaurant menu was not long but the food was excellent fortunately more hotels are beginning to pay attention to their restaurant menus and le meridien has one to make a special visit to try the bouillabaisse or their signature hanger steak frites prices are what you would expect in philly and for this quality we did not think it was overpriced in any way
staff was pleasant and very helpful in all areas front desk housekeeping bar and restaurant 
another nice feature is in the barlobby area outlets galore clearly planned this way eg in the bar table itself so have a drink while working and charging your laptopphone or just enjoy the beautifully paneled room you are in

 the biggest problem was the heat it was hot in the middle of january i cant imagine this place in the summer i walked in and one window was slightly opened and the room was f i turned the ac on high and set the temperature to f the room would not go below  with the windows closed and the air on the entire floor was warm not just my room the room did have a portable fan before going to dinner i opened all three windows and put the fan in one i hoped a pigeon didnt fly in because there are no screens returning i was pleased to find the room temp had dropped to  i dropped the ac from high to low and closed the windows to try to sleep around am i woke up sweating because it was back up to f again i opened the windows to breath but even on the th floor that lets all the noise of ny city in there must be a boiler room below on the  floor because even when i turned on the cold water it came out hot after running for a few minutes it will get coldbut it comes out hot not warm 
 the building itself is very old there are  very old and narrow elevators and  updated elevator if there were ever a fire i would not expect to get out alive with small elevators and staircase on several trips in and out there were bags of rubbish in the hall and several paint cans on a cart i wouldnt call it unsafe because its probably grandfathered up to code but its not nearly as safe as a new hotel in my opinion 
 the room keys are sensitive and stop working during my two days there my key stopped working and i saw several other guests having the same problem 
 there were no face cloths or hand towels in the room i left a note for the cleaning staff and returned to find the note was gone but no face cloths or hand towels i then asked at the front desk and some were quickly sent up 
 the room was tiny similar to staying on a boat you have to plan ahead to move around you wont fit in the room with two large suitcases 
summary
overall good value for the price and great location probably the perfect place to stay after the ball drop on new years eve and i promise youll warm up quickly i would never consider staying here in the summer the location and decor were great but when i travel on business i dont want to even think about the room or temperature or keys etc there are so many places to stay in the city",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

back to the hotel nice staff free breakfast but go get a manhattan bagel comfortable bed very small rooms but thats okay it was clean remember you are at a  star the price is great and you will not have all the amenities of a higher rated hotel go with low expectations and be pleasantly surprised will stay again and am writing this review from room",4.0,4,0.0,0.0

"avoid at all costs
at first glance the hotel seems nice we checked into a first floor room but it didnt feel too safe so we requested a nd or rd floor room the windows looked flimsy like anyone could just break in and there were strange people walking around as we looked outside the front desk was very helpful though and changed our room immediately as we approached the room we saw a luggage cart with trash from in n out on it it sat there for most of the night the trash can by the elevator was overflowing with trash as well
upon entering our room we felt it was more like a motel then a suite the room was not very big there are  sections the bed and a living room however it was narrow and felt cramped the room looked old as i stepped into the bathroom i noticed the toilet had hair all over it yuck called front desk for service waited  min then called again someone came to clean eventually but left a strong bleach odor in the room my wife is preganant which gives her the smelling senses of a hound dog so she had a headache for about  min as we laid down to rest on the bed my wife noticed there was an empty lotion bottle next to the bed i prefer not to think about why it was there im disturbed that housekeeping didnt pick it up makes me wonder how clean everything else was 
the next morning as we headed down to breakfast i noticed the trash was still overflowing with the same trash items mostly food it was still there when we checked out breakfast was supposed to have a meat item however there was no meat item you get an egg substitute omelet toast bagelsi cereal potatoes and waffles not bad for a free breakfast however you have to make your own waffles and i spent a good  min or so waiting in line to make one i spilled waffle mix and the woman that came to clean it made huffing noises and gave me really dirty looks i did say sorry but she just brushed it off nice customer service by the time the waffles were made it was almost closing time i rushed over to get juice and the last yogurt as i was filling up the first shot sized glass of juice the same lady that cleaned the waffle mix asked me if i was going to gfet more yes i said because my yr old son would like something to drink as soon as i had finished filling that second glass she flipped the off switch even though there was a little girl behind me waiting seriously how about you give her a chance to get some juice didnt we pay for this already

my air conditioner did not work i went to the front desk and they sent someone up to look at it i was downstairs and  minutes later they came down and said when the technician went up it was working i was at a wedding that night and when i returned the air conditioner was still not working the room was hot like a sauna and because of the proximity to the freeway it was not an option to leave the balcony door open as it was too loud i tossed and turned and sweat all night it was a miserable experience
in the morning while checking out i advised the front desk staff again they seemed disinterested and basically said oh were sorry
in addition the painting is terrible the bathroom ceiling paint was peeling the bathroom door frame looks like it was slapped together by a crappy contractor the top piece of the frame was off by  inches on either side and completely crooked 
the furniture is nice but the tv is larger than the desktable so it sits completely in front of the mirror in the room the closet door had difficulty opening and closing and the bottom drawer where they hid the safe would unhinge and slam down on my toes every time i opened the closet door

arrived in our room we were suprised of the big bathroom with shower and bath tub seperated nice also the room was quite spacy with a big flat screen tv internet was complementary in our package and worked well allthough it appeard on our bill short talk an it was removed from it
cleaning was ok exept for one day we came back at  pm and room was still not cleaned complementary breakfast was great but we made the mistake and rushed to the nice looking buffet at our first morning bad decission as the waiter brought a  bill nice one we even asked a waiter if this would be the breakfast included for our room and he just sat us to a table for us the sign to use the buffet 
valet parking in this hotel was an interesting experience when we asked for our car to make a little tour we waited for  minutes even other clients who came after us got their cars the boss of the valet parking system noticed us waiting for  minutes and asked us what was wrong after that two wrong cars were brought when finally after searching the key by us we got it
checkout was short and simple getting the car this morning was not a problem at all
after all i can say that if you have the money to afford all the stuff you have to pay for nearly everything it is worth it as its real luxury if you are saving money for your trip just to get in the hotel you will be disappointed also as you are simply not belonging to the other guests you just get the feeling of beeing treated differently especially by other guests who think are something special when sleeping in the ritz",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0

first off our room was just badly designed the exposed shower leaked onto the carpet in the hallway  we had to build a dyke of towels to contain the water the toilet room was far away from the bathroom to get to one side of the bed you had to navigate a maze of furniture the tv and other obstacles  finally stepping over the bed youd think for a hotel built from scratch it would have been better thought out
and then there were the tryingwaytoohard hip crowds downstairs when we came back in from dinner drunk loud and rude
the standard clearly is not the hotel for us and now we realize that  but others looking to stay there might take this into consideration before committing just wish we had not wasted the night there",2.0,2,0.0,0.0
"service sucks
we booked thru the hotel website for  rooms in the regency tower for a one night stay on june   we were told to check in not earlier than  pm since the hotel was fully booked we got in at  pm and the reservation agent was not able to find our reservations although we had the confirmation email from the hotel and had a credit card guaranteed for checkin the front desk agent seemed belligerent and made it seem like he was doing us a favor by trying to get us our  rooms the hotel was a chaotic mess as there were  conventions at the resort being held that same weekend we were not able to get the regency rooms that we booked we were given rooms at the other bldg and upon checking in found out there were no bath towels in the room when we called housekeeping we were told they were understaffed and will get the towels to us in an hour or so well they never came and we never got our towels we had to borrow the towels from our other room overall the service sucks and the hotel was clearly not able to handle the crowd and volume of business that a convention brings to the resort",1.0,1,0.0,0.0
"not even close to  stars
reading these reviews its almost like these other people were staying at a different hotel than us at the last minute we had to drive down to san diego for a family emergency having had good luck with priceline in the past i picked a  star hotel for  a night for two nights and won the town  country resort thinking we had a nice place lined up we set off on our  hour drive to san diego and arrived at  in the morning to find an unfriendly woman working the front desk of course she had no record of our reservation but went ahead and put us in room  
upon arriving in our room it was like going back to the s and staying in a cheap motel the room had  year old blue carpet and was furnished from the  years ago something completely out of a convalescent home for the elderly along with the room came  years of cigarette smoke completely disgusting but at almost  in the morning it wasnt worth the fight to change rooms and of course the room above us had the tv on at am and made sleeping difficult at  am we found out that our room backed up to the maids storage room and we had to put up with all there talking and laughing at that time of the morning
im guessing this place was at one time a nice resort but its apparent they have no money to bring things up to date i would have expected to pay  a night for a place like this because we had prepaid priceline for  nights we were stuck it was so old fashion and dated we brought family members over to see the place we were staying at our only bright spot was that for our third night i went back to priceline and bid  on a   star resort hotel and was able to get the double tree by hilton across the highway a very nice property
if you plan to bid  star on priceline beware that you will most likely win this place it my opinion this place should only be a  or  star hotel",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

only disappointment was breakfast in the executive lounge we wished we had gone to main dining room it was small with furniture that was in poor condition and windows were really dirty spoiling the great view

"completely misleading inn with an attached hotel
first of all  to call this place an inn is a total misnomer i booked a room here after walking past the morrison clark on several trips to the convention center in the past normally i stay at the willard or the crown plaza hamilton when in dc but this inn looked so charming the last time i walked past it  i decided to stay there this time and save some money from the normal hotels i was at it seemed so vintage and cozy from the outside each time i passed it i couldnt wait to actually stay here
they should call this the morrisonclark inn with a large attached hotel behind it because most of the rooms that are sold at this inn are actually in the connecting hotel behind it i felt very misled by the room situation  i thought all the rooms were actually in the main inn  the red brick building you see from the street in fact this is not the case
i was given my key and instructed to go to the elevator next to the check in desk elevator why would i need that when i looked at my folder it said i was on a higher floor higher floor the inn only had two stories from the outside wtf surely enough i stepped into the elevator and went up and it was like i was transported from a charming inn from the late s to a shabby hotel from the s when the doors opened
my hotel room was probably the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in it was smaller than some of the budget hotel rooms i stayed in earlier on in my business career while on a travel budget in nyc it was smaller than a lot of the older hotel rooms even in europe i stayed in which is really saying something the furnishings were nice enough  but there seemed to be way too many things in the small space making it hard to walk around the cruise ship sized room
i opened the windows and the view was terrible there was a neon lit outside coridor thing next to my room where people could easily see into my room if i didnt close the drapes my view from a high floor included several other buildings with a very industrial feel i didnt feel like i was in dc i felt more like i was in downtown newark
the room was dark and the lighting was sparse there were some small recessed type lights in the molding over the bed kind of like youd expect to find on a cruise ship there was a desk lamp and a table lamp next to the bed the paint in the room was a darker brown so it really made the room dark and gloomy i had not expected to be staying in an old towertype hotel  so i decided i would go downstairs to the inn section and have a few drinks to take the sting away from my tiny hotel room
 pm  bar was closed on a friday they suggested i walk a few blocks down the street and go to their sister hotel where they had a bar youve got to be kidding me
the morrisonclark hotel i will not call this an inn is located in a somewhat uncomfortable part of town it certainly is not a far walk to th street and the hussle and bussle of the tourist part of the city during the day at night  you might not exactly feel comfortable walking back to the hotel through empty streets with the occasional homeless person it is in the city across from the convention center  but most everything is closed after dark around it i certainly wouldnt want to walk through the streets in this area maybe  blocks from civilization with a family after dark there is a small smallest ive ever seen cvs across the street that stays open later
to get to the white housesmithsonian museums is about a  minute walk if you are not familiar with the city it will take you a couple times to get used to the walk but it is relatively easy to find your way around if you are comfortable reading maps or navigating a grid type of city certainly walkable and maybe worth the  or so bucks you will save by staying a few blocks outside the action if you are a budget traveler who doesnt want to stay outside the city and take the subway every day
perhaps the biggest dissapointment is the fact that i specifically booked this stay vs my normal places so i could stay at a historic inn in dc and i believe this was misrepresented as being a historic inn because most of the rooms are in the connected hotel for this reason i would never stay here again and tell everyone else the same thing you will pay  for parking and it is valet only which is ridiculous considering the garage is actually in the basement of the hotel and the valet attendend pretty much drives the car  feet to the side of the building and down into the garage
if you want a cheap place to stay in dc which is a bit out of the way but walkable to the main sites  this isnt a bad deal i paid  for a friday in the summer which in dc was about  less than the crown plaza hamilton a few blocks over but  be warned  dont expect to stay in a little inn it is more like a hotel unless you are given one of the fewer rooms in the main inn the standard room is small  two people would be bumping into each other nevermind a family
also  for a small half the size of a normal one bottle of wine in the honor bar is crazy especially when you cant get a glass of wine and sit on the front porch area after  pm on a friday
again this hotel should be ashamed for the the way they describe the rooms on the website making it seem like a quaint inn vs a semirun down hotel or at least give people the option to choose if they want to stay in the inn vs the hotel section also the check in staff is small and international and its not always the service youd expect from a hotel because they are overextended",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

i really wanted to give this hotel a superior ratingi really did but in all honesty our experience left us with such bad feelings that i will have to advise all travelers to miss this hotel if at all possible it is a beautiful refurbished hotel that is  years old and an integral part of seattles history it is close to almost everything you might want to see or do in seattle the breakfast is ok and most of the staff helpful the big problem is the parking or rather the lack of parking the hotel has a section of curbing for loading and unloading the section will accommodate two cars at a time we were the third vehicle the hotel has contracted with the butler garage two blocks uphill for hotel patron parking we were issued a key card which we were told had to be returned at checkout or we would pay a  replacement fee the key is used for entrance and egress from the parking garage what we were not told is the fee to use the garage is day payable upon checkin the hotel did not bill us for parking and so we headed off to the garage to depart only to find out that we could either pay the garage  a day or we could walk back to the hotel to pay our day parking fees the manager of the garage was extremely hostile and rude as she apparently thought we were trying to steal parking when we returned to the hotel the person who had accepted our key card was no longer on duty and his replacement seemed to share the opinion of the parking lot manager fortunately my husband remembered the card number and upon paying the  per day we were released to trudge back up the two blocks get into our vehicle and depart my husband has proclaimed this family will never return to seattle this could get interesting as our daughter was being recruited by the university of washington seriously though do yourself a favor and skip this hotel",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

"great deal and customer service made this an excellent buy
from the time of checkin until check out the service was great and very accommodating also the rooms are clean large and have almost everything you need
its really nice to have two bathrooms one with the toilet and the sink and another with the bath and the sink however it would make more sense to me to put the amenities and the hairdryer in the room with the toilet rather than the bath area this is so that while one person is showering another person can be drying their hair without getting steamed out and yes if you close the door and run the shower it gets steamy inside the room also it would be nice if they would have put some amenities in the second bathroom so youre not running back and forth between them for stuff nitpicky things but i wish they had a haircover and lotion i didnt try calling the front desk for it to see if it was available but there was a small area for groceries and notions right next to the front desk if you wanted something at any time of the day 
beds were comfortable and i asked for extra pillows and blankets and only needed the pillows since i had recent neck surgery a month before this trip i wanted extra cushioning and comfortable beds and this fit the bill i also asked for and received an accessible room since i was using a walker and also needed the railings to help in the bathroom i also had a cane to get around for shorter distances and had left my walker at check in since we were rushing to get to the tgif at night before it closed arrived late at night off a delayed flight yes its that close i didnt even need my walker it was right outside the door and up the walkway about  yards the check in agent offered to let me keep my things while we ate so i left the luggage with him when we came back an hour later he had already transferred everything up to our room making it so nice to just get myself upstairs and straight to room right next to elevator and no it didnt bother me to have the noise from the elevator but the doors dont quite meet the rug at the bottom of the doorway so if youre a light sleeper and sound bothers you then you have to weigh your decision on whether you want or need to be close to the elevator vs the sound but there was a very inconsiderate guest across the way from us who had allowed her kids  boys to run around playing outside in the hallways she brought this portable soccer goal and they set it up right outside my door and used the long hallway to kick the ball down i was from the west coast so while it was about am it was am to meand we didnt get to sleep til well after  am after dinner and showers the night before i didnt really enjoy being woken up by the sounds of boys kicking a ball around and rustling around by the door i had opened it and looked at them shaking my head and asked them to move down the hall a bit they did but i was now awake so i decided i might as well go get some treats at the breakfast bar before it closed at  
so i used my walker knowing it would be easier to carry things in it and walking then to try and balance everything i found lots of great stuff they had juice milk coffee danish waffles eggs sausage fruit cups sealed and fruits i had grabbed plenty of everything tossing it in the walker and the girl who refilled the food offered to help me gather things she noticed i was taking it upstairs to put in the room and said to use a coffee cup since it was larger and had a cover and we loaded everything in my walkers bin i thought it was very considerate of her to help and to give me the advice when i knew she was busy i took enough for me and my daughter and figured to reheat it in the microwave and also had the frig for the juice and fruit cups and fruit my daughter loved having the fruit cups when she woke up while i was heating everything she didnt care for reheated sausage and eggs but it worked for me i didnt bother with waffles since there was a line and i didnt want to stand there waiting for it with my walker cuz i kinda blocked the area with it theres not a lot of room to move around or to sit so i was actually happy with what i had and was content to take it upstairs and eat it there my daughter liked sleeping in and eating next to the tv and when i was done i jumped on the internet and checked mail while she ate so everything worked out fine 
we were there for a sporting meet at the convention center so i chose this location for its proximity to the center for the lower price i was very happy with the results our friends stayed at the jw paying about  more for the room per night plus taxes had no frig or microwave had to pay for breakfast and all their other food as well as internet they were closer to the center and had a nicer room but paid the extra money for everything and had  kids and could have used the savings of eating reheated food and had no way of keeping their leftovers cold we ate at a pizza place called bazbeaux on massachusetts ave while we went window shopping and their pizzas were good but huge even for a small sized one so we had tons of pizza left over i was happy we had the frig and the microwave but the other family was saying hmm no microwave oh well we like cold pizza but hmm we dont have frig either so i guess well have to leave it out they thought about opening a windowbalcony to put it on to keep it cold but couldnt because the jw is all windows on the outside lol we didnt have any problems  so i said i was happy to walk the few extra feet for the other conveniences and we probably saved at least  over them oh if youre walking around on massachusetts be sure to keep walking all the way up until you get to the flying cupcake great big huge red velvet cupcakes for about  each about twice the size of the ones ive seen at home in vegas and they were good i wanted to try their chocolate peanut butter ones but someone right in front of us got the last one rats she said it was one of their more popular flavors so be sure to go earlier and grab some mmm it cost about  for  cupcakes but was our special treat for the day
convention center notes it was cold at night when the meet was over but no rain or snow first week of jan so it was nice to have everything covered and inside but when leaving the convention center you dont want to be the last ones out because they lock the doors betw the center and the walkways and we couldnt get into them and had to go outside to cross the street to the jw it was freezing but once inside the jw were able to use the walkways from the jw to springhill it was  yds to get to the back entry elevator of the springhill but with my walker i was able to handle it youre walking the length of the jws convention area to get to the springhill theres a starbucks too right at the point of the jws entrance to the convention centers walkway so if you want to grab a coffee and munchie before heading in do so  cuz theres nothing inside the center except expensive concessions that were down the hall from our event another  yds no thanks the coffeehot chocolate and scones worked fine 
we brought our ipod touch for communication since i couldnt carry the weight of my computer around with me this trip i basically wanted to be able to access the internet for convenience and check emails and post on facebook the ipod did everything and they had an ipod recharger unit on the radio wow talk about convenience glad i brought the charger tho cuz their radio unit wasnt charging it very well but if you just need wireless internet for simple things wow the ipod touch saved me a lot of weight and extra gear i couldnt afford to bring my  yr old daughter had to carry everything so i definitely needed a hotel with services and understanding staff and i had to plan well since i did and the staff was great my trip was an easy one and i couldnt ask for more except for the same inconsiderate guest  she let her boys play in front of my room again the second morning even earlier my guess is that the guests down the hall complained so they moved their game in front of my door extending it in the other direction towards the elevator if you came off the elevator youd be greeted by nerf soccer balls and kids using the elevator area as the other goal when i looked out my door the mom was just packing stuff up and had her door open so i commented with a really two mornings in a row cmon and the boys said oh sorry and continued to play the mom said they said theyre sorry and let them continue no apologies from her no boys you need to play quietly or stop so i decided to call the front desk and ask them to do something they apologized and i told them they didnt need to cuz its not the hotels fault they just needed to make them stop i also told them itd be best to send someone up to see what the kids were doing it took less than  minutes before that game was shut down i was so tired and being woken up so early again i was pretty mad so i called the front desk and asked if i could have an extra hour to get myself together and sleep for just a few more minutes he said if its only an hour then that was fine the extra hour was plenty i just needed a little buffer because i couldnt get everything packed that fast when i checked out a couple hours later the front desk asked if it had quieted down or if there was any more trouble and i said no the front desk service was obviously very attentive and knew exactly who was calling in and remembered me and asked if my stay was ok yes it was  thanks to them so give them a chance to correct things and im sure youll have a great stay 
btw if you need a taxi check online and get the phone number into your cell phone ahead of time when you call them you can mention you saw their online ads for  tofrom the airport and thats what theyll charge instead of  for traffic and stops and mileage i saved more than  one way compared to our friends who just caught the first taxi in the taxi line but planning it next time ill call ahead a few minutes to allow for the guy to get there because they needed  minutes to get to the airport they werent already there and you dont catch the taxi in the same place  you need to walk further to another place to catch an arranged taxi ride our friend asked me how i got the deal and wanted to do it going home and one driver warned her that you cant just hop in any taxi and say you want to pay  so he gave our friends the phone number so she could call for a return ride to the airport its also  for a ride anywhere within the downtown area  but some taxis charge extra if you have  people like we did since we traveled as a group and caught it outside the jw front lobby to massachusetts ave but i used my taxi service phone  to arrange our return ride back and he charged me   no extra if youre travelling with a limited budget you can appreciate the savings wherever they are
hope this is helpful to other travelers because i really relied on other comments to help plan my trip if youre traveling following a surgery sometimes you just need a little extra tlc and can really appreciate it when someone offers the little extras without having to ask for them or charge for every little thing you need and thats how the springhill suites was i cant guarantee everyone would receive extra service but if you ask nicely im sure if they can they will also i booked this trip early but im a marriott member and received a notice that there was sale pricing at the hotel a few days before my trip so i asked if i was able to change my reservation without losing my accessible room marriott made the change and i got an additional discount so instead of paying the regular  rate aaa member price i got the same room for about  per night i saved about  for the weekend last minute because of the sale so keep checking up to the time you travel you might still find better rates if youre wanting to save a few bucks",5.0,2,-3.0,3.0

"front desk staff needs retraining
every year i stay for  nights at this hotel the only reason theyve kept me as a client for so many years is that my other option is the westin galleria or stay outside the galleria this time around i thought they might get a better review the hotel has finally upgraded their elevators to the intelligent ones and this has made the service much more efficient until they stop working on a sunday morning and people had to use the service elevators or the stairs the hotel didnt provide any information to their guests luckily we were on the th floor and were not checking out
last year the shower in my room didnt work this year it was the safe the security staff that had to come in to fix it was really apologetic the problem was complicated it took  visits to get it to work properly my huge complaint is the customer service westin oaks provide through service express no matter how big or small the business you should always listen to the client if im paying for a service i expect to receive a comprehensive replay like we are doing everything we can to solve the problem we are very sorry for the inconvenience and offer a solution later i learned that they have safes downstairs for cases like this the response i received from service express on friday night was what would you like me to do i cant do anything and dont talk to me like that my tone was firm asking for a quick solution
the westin oaks provide good rooms its clear to me that im paying for the location but i dont know how they are keeping their star rating any staff member that interacts with clients must be patient they are representing the company in this case westin oaks is showing not only a lack of supervision of their maintenance also the towels were torn also a lack of customer service training",3.0,1,-2.0,2.0

i stayed at the hotel whitcomb for a week for work this wasnt out of choice  my work booked me in there and it was conveniently close to the office like youre doing now i always check trip advisor for impartial reviews on hotels so i wanted to do some research before i came out 
so here is my personal take on the hotel
location
whilst convenient for work i was a lone female traveller visiting the city for the first time everyone talks about this hotel being convenient for union square etcbut my advice go to a hotel near union square this area is rated as the grittiest area of san francisco  be prepared to see lots of homeless people scattered outside the hotel i am a city girl born and raised in london but even the concierge told me not to walk around the area on my own at night and only some areas were ok in the day time not the most confidenceinspiring thing to be told on arrival so even though the bart is literally outside the hotel i didnt want to take my chances so i took a taxi everywhere there is nothing noteworthy to see in the immediate surroundings of the hotel although there is a theatre nearby if you are planning on watching a play
hotel
a historic hotel this may be but it needs some serious updating yes the lobby is grand and inviting yes the staff are pleasant enough but the rooms are dated and need a good lick of paint an updated heatventilation system and bathrooms need to be ripped out one word of advice here book a king room at least you get the space and a big bed which by the way are comfortable the bathroom ventilation system is so loud you may be tempted not to switch the light on and the bath was so stained and uninviting you would rather just have a shower note even though the shower temperature indicated hot when you turned the dial to the left i discovered the only way to get hot water was to turn the dial to cold and wait at least  minutes to get hot water there is no safe in the room which i would have assumed would be a standard requirement dont expect room service as they do not offer this another word of advice bring your own shower gel as they only provide soap i was on the nd floor and my room faced the back of the hotel  i was relieved as i had read reviews that the front of the hotel facing market street was too noisy relieved until at am in the morning i heard a truck loading and unloading towels til am in the morning this happened  nights out of my  night stay also be prepared for a stale old smell in the hallways and the bedrooms 
if you dont mind staying in a basic hotel and you are prepared to be in a less than attractive area than this hotel will fulfil your needs the concierge are very friendly and always hailed a taxi for me  i also felt safe once inside the hotel",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0
"excellent location and service
i stayed at the westin times square while on a week vacation in nyc in august  my experience and recommendation can be described by the below
location
the hotel is definitely at one of the best locations you can stay at in nyc located in the heart of midtown it is exactly at times square with all major attractions and entertainment facilities located in a radius of  to  blocks th avenue for example is only  blocks away while avenue of the americas is  blocks down 
as soon as you step out of the main entrance you are on th avenue rd street just seconds away form a variety of restaurants and bistros from all around the world shake shack is just in frontjust cross the road
furthermore the hotel is at really close distance from all artistic attractions of broadway the minksof theater where lion king is playing is just two blocks ahead and all other theaters at a walking distance the intrepid museum is on th avenue accessible on foot or  minutes by cab including the nyc traffic
the hotel really has one of the best locations to be in while touristing in nyc
hotel and rooms
the building is really nice both on the outside and on the inside main entrance on th avenue is lavish and holds the security and baggage claim desks a large escalator takes you all the way up to a grand front desk and concierge services as well as a really cozy and elegant seating area the experience starts really well at the hotel the minute you step inside the lobby
the hotel also has another entrance from nd street which is equally nice
rooms are quite large and very well decorated i was in a two double bed that was very spacious and really comfortable it was on the th floor boasting a great view on the hudson river and the surrounding area the bathroom is neatly decorated and equipped with all services you would expect
the only drawback is that on some floors the halls are a little complex and intertwine with one another halls are all greyish so some light or colors might make things look way better but it is not a note that will push you away from the hotel it is just a small note i picked up while there
service
service at the westin cant be described by nothing other than just perfect you are greeted with a beautiful smile that makes you feel welcome every single step of the way i would like to extend the best compliments to sarah at front desk who was just wonderful in making the check in process one of a kind knowing that my room was not available at time of check in she was really great in the way she reassured me and greeted me at the premises i truly recommend that you ask for her if you check in at the westin
as for room service and house keeping they are also very nice i have been provided with all my requests and more by really great personnel who never refrained from being there whenever they were needed
security and bell boys are extremely helpful they were great in helping me with directions and booking of cars and taxis 
service at the westin is one of the best i have ever experienced in a high end hotel 
prices
well to be honest it is not a cheap hotel i ended up paying usd  a night and that was a discounted rate but i think it is a perfectly explained price for such a hotel location and time of the year high season it is really worth every penny
i strongly recommend the westin times square for your next stay in nyc",4.0,5,1.0,1.0

nice boutique hotel in a great location the bar lounge is awesome with great service it is a dark place and the rooms dont have good lighting  which is ok with me the only negative i have is that i upgraded to a business package deal to get  an upgrade to the room  passes to equinox gym  free breakfast and  free wi fi for a higher price i didnt really care about the wi fi and am not a breakfast person but i was excited to try the equinox nearby and get a room upgrade the person at the front desk didnt even know i had upgrade to this particular package i had to tell her and then when she looked at the computer she seemed to know she promptly gave me my passes to equinox and my breakfast vouchers 
unfortunately there was no room upgrade i specifically asked her what time i could use the breakfast vouchers and she said  when i went down at  day  they said the voucher was only good until a oops they were nice enough to rebound and make accomodations for her misinformation and i got a nice breakfast
the bose system also did not work in the room and i had no music to listen to when i called to ask if i was doing something wrong to engage it i was told ill call you back and got no call back
overall the room was ok for nyc and the location was good and the gym was sufficient i would say the the barrestaurant staff make this place one to go back to",3.0,3,0.0,0.0
"very nice hotel in great location
the crowne plaza is very nice with great rooms and public spaces and friendly staff
it is located right on the riverwalk on the south side of the river adjacent to the main st bridge so you can can easily enjoy the riverwalk and restaurants on the south side of the river or stroll across the bridge into downtown or they have a shuttle that will take you various places the night views of the lit up city and the bluelit bridge are gorgeous
the pool and deck area are really great either to enjoy alone or to have an event the inhouse breakfast restaurant is small but nice with a buffet and limited cook to order food there is a ruths chris inside as well
my only two complaints are there should be a hot tub in the pool area and the fitness center is pretty pitiful for such a nice hotel a little more space and put in one universaltype machine guys",4.0,4,0.0,0.0

"neverending disappointment
we booked this hotel for a  night stay following our wedding the price was great the location is also fabulous some of the negatives are par for the course in chicago like outrageous parking fees day and overly busy lobbies without any friendly greeting ok whatever 
we got up to the room a junior corner suite and were very excited about the great view again great location then we noticed that the ac in the bedroom wasnt working in the midst of july on a high floor with giant windows this was very obvious it was already late so we decided to try to sleep and called the next morning this began a series of  phone calls and trips to the front desk requesting that it be fixed the first technician they sent never came the second tried his best to fix the problem but failed the third rudely walked into an overheated room looked at the ac said it was working and left we also had technicians supposedly arrive while we were out but there was no note and no evidence that anything had been fixed this happened over about  hours 
by the nd night we asked to be moved and they assured us it would be to an equal room it wasnt we were moved from a  room junior suite in decent condition to a horrible executive room with wires poking out everywhere holes in the wall ripped base board and a three inch gap under the door that ac also was not cooling very well this was at am we requested to be moved back to the hot room as it was less disgusting the night manager offered a complimentary breakfast which is a  blah continental thing nice but it did not fix anything 
now back in the original room we also mentioned that the showertub did not drain every time we showered the water rose above our ankles and puddled essentially we were showering in the filth of everyone who had stayed there before we called no maintenance came we spoke to someone again finally a man arrived and pulled out a little hair only spent about  seconds unclogging the drain and then poured a bit of drain chemicals in and left needless to say it didnt work so the third night we attempted to shower found that we were still standing in a puddle of filth and now chemicals we requested to change rooms 
the rd room was the actual equivalent room  a corner junior suite it was fine the ac worked the shower drained too little too late 
we had high hopes im sure other people have had lovely stays here the location is the only true pro it was not worth the low price we paid and we will gladly pay more to stay somewhere else the next time we visit chicago this is the one and only time we will stay in this hotel mediocre food poor service and broken rooms do not make for a very nice honeymoon",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

i came down again the next morning and pointed out a few extra things i found wrong in the room including someone elses hair still attached to the hair dryer a moldmildew spot in the corner of the bathroom and the rusting door frame of the bathroom thankfully despite being overbooked they were at least able to relocate us although i feel quite bad for the folks that ended up in our room that night the second room was much better and in seaport tower it actually smelled clean was clean had dry carpet and it had a lovely view with it being a corner room we had  windows to enjoy the view with the remainder of our stay was better and the buffet at laels was quite delicious but during the first  days of the stay quality of the room and the construction noise occurring above the room left something to be desired

"going downhill faster than a cable car
ive stayed at this particular ritz carlton over a dozen times but hadnt been there in about  years i have anew business matter that will take me to san francisco every month or so for the next year so was looking forward to staying at the ritz again
i stayed there last month and was shocked i hadnt realized that marriott bought them and dont know if that is the reason for the changes when i arrived i was stunned  theyd just completed a major renovation of the bar the restaurant and the main lounge off the entry area
the new areas are dreadful  the main lounge area was a shock  its a bizarre mix of disharmonious colors and furniture design that cant be explained i guess the closest description would be clockwork orange come to the ritz the bar has a red light glow the walls are dark charcoal the chairs look like they were plucked from a disney ride the fabrics are in a visual war with each other and for people who like comfort when they relax for a couple of hours with some friends over drinks if you like your chairs at rigid  degree angles that leave you with back pain youll love it i cant imagine an uglier room and we spent some time retrying to conceive of a contemporary design concept that could explain what they did we failed  no design concept was apparent 
the new restaurant lives up to the maxim if it aint broke dont fix it the closest visual analogy i could think of was one of those allyoucaneast buffet rooms in a glitzy las vegas hotel and the old bar with its comfortable cozy chairs and warm colors has been replaced by something resembling a waiting room in one of those airport club lounges only most of the latter are more inviting
for perspective i am not a big fan of the ritz carltons more classic look of repro american furniture so its not as if they replaced something i loved but this particular ritz with its admirable location and nice scale was a good place and now its awful i used to spend hours meeting friends and clients in the discreet old bar and the lounge during my  days i didnt spend a minute  well one exception when i went to the bar adjacent the restaurant for a bar snack i couldnt find a single thing on the menu that i wanted and ill usually go for anything
another defect the room havent been touched yes theyre clean but they are very dated and boring what was nice  years ago is just plain dull
and the one thing i always intensely disliked at the ritz  well theyve kept that  the staff is intrusive indiscreet and sometimes just plain aggressive somehow the ritz is able to find perfectly nice and motivated staff and train them to intrude on the clientele at every opportunity when you come down in the morning on your way to the entrance to find a taxi you run a gauntlet of insincerely robotically programmed staff yelling out your name  i dont need  good morning mr x greetings when i walk  yards to the entrance whenever i stayed at the ritz if it was for a business deal that needed to be kept discreet i always had my clients check in with fake names to avoid having their names shouted for every passing journalist to hear and leak to the wall street journal

nice walking trails in the area they are in a business area with lots of high rises but well manicured and kept up some of the pics i have seen make it look more naturenatural than it is but i got a decent run and there are mileage markers 
workable fitness room new equipment clean two treadmills one elliptical and some weights they provide water towels and headphones which i always appreciate 
lots of restaurants in the area to try out as well as some good shopping
good work area in room comfy bed decent tvs with a good variety of stations minifridge was in my room which i like 
room noise was average i didnt hear much noise from neighbors halls or street a little but not bad

yearround indoor pool and spa not huge but nice 
great outdoor deck we took advantage of
free coffee in the am but keep in mind courtyards are not freebreakfast like some of the other properties these days 
room sizes are good can spread your legs a bit 
things to consider
restaurant is limited basic selections fair prices and limited hours but they do offer cocktails and a breakfast and dinner seating casual 
bathroom was clean but plain all in working order but nothing fancy 
rooms have the old style acheat units that can be loud not really complaining this is true in a lot of hotels but can take getting used to to fall asleep 
 a little congested during the week business area so plan accordingly if commuting somewhere

there is a  parking charge but honestly i cant even remember the last time i wasnt charged a parking fee at a hotel you are able to park in the secure parking garage for the price or risk being on the street or public parking and coming back late and not having a spot it was worth it for us there is a small little caf in the lobby and there are a few local restaurants that will deliver to your room and the menus were provided for you

i had a room on the th floor it was spooky the th floor is only half a floor rooms on one side of the hall the other side of the hall is roof the hallway temperature was in the mid s the building moaned with mechanical sounds coming seemingly from everywhere more than once i was reminded of the movie barton fink ice machines are located on floors   and  however all of them were out of order ice was available in the lobby 
the door from the garage to the hotel was unlocked at all times see a previous review about the door being broken the garage itself seemed dirty and dingy 
sound insulation is nonexistent there was a surprising amount of road noise given i was on the th floor
overall the place looks run down it isnt dirty but certainly not as clean as other fairfield inns in fairness the price was very cheap
my reccomendation to you is to check out the courtyard inn about  mile north on the same road my reccomendation to marriott is a close the th floor and do a complete remodel or take your good name off this property",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

"we left after  mins shockingly bad
had one of the worst experiences of my travelling life here do not stay there
we booked quiet last minute on hotwirecom so didnt know what we were getting til it was confirmed we had expected a star room for two what we got was a staror lower shabby room with two small twin beds 
as we checked in the queue was huge but this was around pm so check in time so not really surprised or put out by that the lobby area is lovely and the reception staff were friendly enough it was when we got to our room that it all went very down hill 
the room was very dated scuffs on the wall and curtains that didnt closethere was a basic blind behind the net curtain that barely blacked out the room the street noise was very loud and we were located by the lifts on the third floor 
the constant bell ringng of the lift as it hit our floor in the short time we were there confirmed that this room would be way too noisy without sleeping tablets and ear plugs we read through the hotel manual and it mentions to use the door chain on the door and not open the door unless there is confirmation of identity which rang our alarm bells then we saw that the door chain was hanging on as if it had been busted before then as we started to unpack we realised the room didnt have a personal safe i have never stayed in any room that didnt have a safe and frankly having to go down to reception with all our belongings to store is not professional or very reassuring then looking online we saw several reports of theft from this hotel
we sat there not sure what to do we spent  on two nights here and had plans for the evening so time was short we decided to stay and give it a go i used the toilet only to discover the bowl was filthy and the bathroom grotty then my partner pointed out a cigarette burn on the bed throw this room was nonsmoking i felt itchy at the thought of what other oversights they had made at this we decided that there was no way we could stay here we went online and booked another hotel at top price for the rest of our holiday we knew we were going to have to just write off the money as there is no refunds on our booking we returned to reception and told them we were going to check out when we told them why we were leaving they were surprised and i mentioned the cigarette burn i was informed that a refund was not possible which i told them i was aware of and hadnt expected we would get one there was no offer of a different roomnot that we would have stayed at this stage 
the location is not desirable and very dodgyi have been to san fran before and we had been in the city for four days prior to our brief stay here so knew the city fairly well by the time we checked in there were so many hobos outside and in the areasomething we were used to as this is highly visable in central sf but this was a much higher level and quiet scary frankly if you have no valubales and dont mind slumming it you may be ok im sure there are other nicer rooms here but star rating is a bloody joke we wasted our money and it almost ruined our holiday

the rooms are big in comparision to some hotels ive stayed in in new york huge king size bed a big flat screen tv not that i watched much on it as was busy seeing the city the bathroom was a good size and the shower was great lots of power and hot loved the makeup mirror and the nice molton brown toiletries room was very clean and bed turned down every night and  little chocolates left to enjoy loved the big safe as i could keep my ipad in it along with some expensive gifts i did not use the mini bar or any of the drinks or food on top of cabinet as i knew they would be very expensive but with a duane reade drugstore  blocks away i got water food and some toiletries i needed 
the lobby area was always busy with people on their laptops ipads and phones it was a nice area to sit in and email family  friends but why not just give you it free in your room did not need to use the concierge as been to nyc so many many times and know it well but heard them giving out help and information to many guests and was amazed at there knowledge
i had a room at the back of building on th floor with a view out to park ave which was fine as only spent time in the room to bring back my shoppinggifts and to sleep it was a very nice quiet floor i was on the side where the large crane was for most of my week stay and i never heard any noise from the work being done neither late into the night or early morning there was a starbucks opposite the entrance and every morning i headed down there for breakfast of a peach melbagranola pot and muffin all for around  dollars and well worth it breakfast was just too expensive to eat in the hotel
the hotel location was perfect madison ave and thst streets and one block to th ave i had all the shops i wanted so close to hand plenty of places to eat all so close to hand i found bills bar  burger bar close to the rockefeller centre and it was a great place to eat in the food was fantastic it was on st st just off th ave
on the day i was checking out i had a late flight and asked if there were restrooms i could use to freshen up and was told i could use the showers and facilities in the fitness and spa centre as it was all complimentary it was great as it was a hot humid day and around pm i was able to shower freshen up my hair and change into my clothes for flight home i thought this was a nice little perk for guests also on that day one of the porters was a real gent unfortunately i cannot remember his name very tall guy late s early s i have a joint problem with one of my elbows and he very nicely weighed my case with travel scales id brought with me

the extended stay america hotel is located at the end of a culdesac within an industrial park and surrounded by other name brand hotels as noted by other reviewers it is unusual looking as if in a previous life the building was a garden apartment and it could probable be converted to that again
i booked a stay through priceline and got a tremendous deal the hotel would probably not be happy with me if i mentioned my rate in this review but i was very pleased with the price my room and all rooms was recently renovated i returned to the hotel after work one day and found a brand new mattress next day there was a brand new flat panel tv next day was a brand new leather chair they are really putting a lot of work into this hotel my room was a corner unit with windows on two walls so during the day the room was bright with natural sunlight
the hotel has a small pool small fitness room with three machines and a laundry room with three washers seemed more than adequate i never waited for any machines in either the fitness nor the laundry
what makes this hotel stand out for me was the staff without exception every staff member acknowledged me with a smile and a pleasant greeting i encountered desk staff maintenance men and housekeepers and there were no sour attitudes i would especially like to thank shamika for her excellent customer service several times i checked out and back into this hotel and each time she had my checkin processed before i arrived as shed seen my reservation come through from priceline also i would like to acknowledge anissia and audrey for their unfailing helpful and pleasant service

i have long held a certain fondness for the kings inn having stayed there numerous times there was a feeling of comfort in staying in familiar surroundings on each trip to beautiful san diego i have always considered myself to be somewhat of a hotel or motel snob if you will and the kings inn was my first venture into less luxurious surroundings i fell in love with the wonderful waffle house located adjacent to the property and while not cheap the waffle house does not skip on portions or service the amigo spot is absolutely fantastic the food is excellent and the staff charming saturday night at the amigo offers up a live jazz band which was very impressive on my last visit sadly there is a downside to the kings inn that i had chosen to ignore during past visits captivated by its charm i looked past the musty ever present smell that seems to linger and the terribly stained carpet that has been present in every room i have stayed in i also chose to ignore the filthy laundry room where the washers and dryers are covered in layers of dirt not only on the outside of the machines but on the inside as well i soon came to realize that the lack of attention to cleanliness was not merely an oversight but rather a total disregard for those who have been loyal patrons of this establishment the kings inn is always booked solid due to its cult like following it is not hurting financially as its rooms typically run from about  to over  a night however they do occasionally run specials the reality is that the owner has no reason to keep the place up or even keep the place clean people just keep coming back and i was one of them i have decided to bid a fond farewell to the kings inn for now and hope that the owner will someday wake up and smell the mildew",3.0,1,-2.0,2.0

"first and last time i will be staying here
i had a terrible experience staying at this hotel i was here for a week in october we checked in on a saturday night and we were assigned a room on the nd floor facing th avenue it was so loud in the room we could not even get to sleep this hotel is located right in downtown and you will not be able to get to sleep in any room facing th avenue unless you are really high up so already your stay is ruined because of no sleep
we asked if we could move to another room but the person at the desk said they were full they eventually got us another room on the second day which was facing th avenue 
the second complaint i have is they will harass you everyday to come to a meeting with them in order for you to buy a timeshare the first day they said they would give us a  gift to show up to the meeting but it is definitely not worth it because of the amount of time you spend with them if you decline the first invitation they will do whatever they can to get you to ruin your whole trip you will get letters underneath your door post cards hanging from your door and phone calls to your room in order to come to the meeting 
we made a big mistake attending one these meetings with them in florida and it cost us  for the week that is how we ended up staying here at the wyndham harbour lights i will tell you it was the biggest mistake because of how much of a rip of it is you can rent places for weekly vacations at a much cheaper rate so i recommend not attending these meetings because they will convince you to buy something that is not worth it and you will regret it in the long run
the third complaint i had was the room service they are suppose to clean your room every  days they did not show up the one time because we had a do not disturb sign which was our fault but we called them to clean it the next day and they forgot so the room was left messy the towels were dirty eventually we called the front desk and karen ended up cleaning our room quickly before we went to bed 
the fourth complaint i have was when i was going to get some coffee down on the first floor which is free to everyone i was a bit hungry and noticed some bagels on the table where they hold the meetings well when i went there the person said can i help you i said i just want to get a bagel she told me you need to make an appointment are you serious i paid  to stay here for a week and you are saying i cant have a bagel that cost  to them this is ridiculous i was really disappointed with them it was an older lady in blonde hair and every time i walked by her she gave me a dirty look later on we told that to karen and she said i could have a bagel whenever i want she was the only nice person there 
finally this is not a place you want to go for a family of four two people will sleep nice in the bed and the other  will break their backs on the sofa bed they have in the rooms they are so uncomfortable because the mattresses are a lot thinner than normal sofa beds by the end you will be glad to leave and go back in your own bed

i tried using the hair dryer but it was defective and looked like it might cause electric shock the motel does offer a free breakfast but dont expect much watered down coffee white bread muffins cereal thats dispensed like dry pet food my other peeve was finding a few ants in the bathroom on the first day
now on to the good theres free wifi the tv has many cable channels including all hbo channels theres a pool thats clean free parking a safe in the room and a big plus for me was the la metro subway is only a block away if walk past the metro station vermontsunset theres a very nice section of shops and restaurants if youre walking toward wendys youre going the wrong way i felt pretty safe on the streets of course youll find homeless people and other sorts wandering around but its a major city  get used to it

if this had been the only issue during our stay then we might possilby consider returning maybe the front desk manager was just having a bad day but during our stay there were a host of other issues including the wireless internet not working and even worse the hotel not being able to offer a solution other than waiting until the next day when the whole system apparently reboots returning to the room in the early afternoon after being out several hours during the morning to find the room still not made up the safe in our room malfunctioning the plumbing also leaves something to be desired  the water pressure in the shower was weak and it felt like they were rationing hot water

pros
very inexpensive with the money we saved staying at this hotel we paid for most of what we did during the day
basic amenities front desk lobby elevator hot water 
location is right off broadway and two blocks from the subway and from riverside park lots of restaurants within walking distance
daily room cleaning bed made and clean towels every day 
shower was modern and very comfortable 
ac
we had a private bath but i checked out the shared one in the hallway clean and basic 
cons
very basic 
the elevator is small max three people very very slow we stayed on the fifth floor and we climbed the steps most of the time 
our door only shut when it was locked 
our ac worked but looked disgusting it only had two effective settings fan on or off ac on or off the room would actually get too cold over night which was amazing because it was very hot outside

"excellent stay until the fat lady sang
okay first it wasnt a fat lady but after a wonderful time the last few moments in the hotel left me shaking my head
i was coming into nyc with a well known person for a party and because of previous experiences while out with him i have literally had his fans toss me to the side like a rag muffin so that they could get close to him and a photo and my experience with another well known hotel the week before where i was actually panhandled by a driver and badgered unrelentlessly i with purpose called the le parker and specifically requested that we be placed in an area of the hotel that might assure us some privacy and they handled our request beautifully 
our room was spacious and well appointed we were never bothered by staff and our request for an extra robe and towels was met quickly and with efficiency note to hotel when  guest are checking into a room it would be appropriate to have two robes available for each guest especially with the fact that it was specifically requested that we truly wanted privacy 
the staff upon check in were wonderful and allowed for a very quick check in with very little needed the concierge was quick to provide an umbrella fir our use during the rain pour and were kind enough to remember who i was when i returned the umbrella
the bar area is beautiful as is the pools view the decor tasteful sleek with a very euopean flair our mini bar was well stocked and the shower in the room was a treat for a physically tired body i had just commuted well over  hours in just  days and was a little beaten up by it all and the shower felt like a hundred magic fingers releasing the stresses of travel
everything was perfect for us as we have both stayed at the hotel before and my last experience had left me with a headache this one while there did not and for him it brought back a rush of memories of many a night there while in tour or seeing old friends and this trip was also proving to be an experience of fondess until our check out time
we had opted for the breakfast package where we could check out later this giving us some time to relax before hurrying off to our next destination which we luxuriated in it was a wonderful treat to be able to do this but upon check out is when it became nasty and well turned a wonderful experience into one that fell short of what we would expect of a hotel of this level
instead if opting for the express check out we went to the front desk to do so i had placed our incidental charges in cash and as we had not used anything not even getting the breakfast that was part of the package this should have been a very easy process it was not the woman checking me out was insolent and quite frankly her behavior was unacceptable by all means
i wasbnot rude did not speak down to her was not snippy but walked away in complete frustion and with a foul taste in my mouth
when i went to check out i handed her my receipt for my deposit she pulled up my info on her pc screen and asked me how i wished to pay for the reminder of my charges that i owed after she would be crediting my account with the  dollars for incidental charges what what charges we hadnt used anything hadnt ordered room service hadnt gotten the breakfast that was part of our package had not used the minibar had not purchased a robe but yet she wanted me to pay an additional  dollars that she was stating i still owed my mind was completely boggled now i had prereserved the room which also meant that i had put the room on my credit card and had already seen that the amount had been dedeucted from my account how on earth could i owe another  dollars this went on and on and on meanwhile my companion is beginning to get very restless and becoming very uncomfortable standing there as all of this is playing out and to top things off we were checking out before the time we needed to as we needed to beat traffic out of the city so that he could make his next concert in an entirely different state within a few hours 
upon feeling his extreme discomfort and my total frustration at the situation that was unfolding i urged him to go get the car around so that we could still try to make it out of the city in time and i pulled out my ipad so that i could pull up my account online and show this woman that the room was already paid for at this point she disappeared for an ungodly amount of time leaving me unattended and nervously looking at the time that was passing 
when she finally returned she was still rude which is when i explained that i had and have been a previous guest at this very hotel as well as the entire family if hotels that they have which is when her tone dripped with sarcasm and actual disbelief tht i could have possibly stayed hee before at that point i was fed up and told her that the way this was being handled was completely unacceptable on every level and if we had not been pressed for time i would have demanded to see a manager 
i showed her on my ipad my online banking account that indeed showed the room had already been paid for and at that point she sulkingly returned my deposit and i left the hotel completely exasperated frustrated and no longer with the fond memories of a night spent blissfully but now only concerned about my companion making his previously booked engagement and apologetic that he had to stand there in the lobby while all of this transpired
after my last two experiences with this hotel i am truly questioning if i would indeed be a guest at this hotel again the only saving grace may be the location and the pool and the performance of the other staff during my stay",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

i will start off with the good the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and this includes everyone from the front desk to the bellman to the cleaning people they were all nice and friendly we were on an upper level with an amazing view of the space needle the hotel is located half way between the space needle and pikes place it is very walkable distance to both and the area appeared to be relatively safe we were out until  and did run into any problems we received a free american breakfast with our stay and the food was good the scones were amazing
now for the bad the room has seen better days the carpet was stained the floor boards were screaming for a fresh coat of paint the decor was early s the tv was a tube tv from the mid s the corners and edges of the wood furniture were beaten up just not a very nice room it was clean just old i would like to think the carpet was clean and just stained but there is really no telling i decided to leave my sandal on the while time i was there 
the warwick was supposed to have completed the remodel of all but the lower floors but the room we had was on of the classic rooms their website even states the classic rooms are located on the lower floors but i assure you we had a classic aka rundown room and it was on the th floor 
we only stayed there for one night so we just dealt with the room that reminded us of a roadside lodge
with this said i cant emphasize how nice the staff was that is the reason the warwick received a  and not a  if were to stay here again i would be sure to sacrifice the view for a remodeled room the room was  not bad for a remodeled room in downtown seattle but over priced for a classic room",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0

"id avoid it
there are so many bad bad things about this hotel my impulse is to say avoid at all costs but ill be generous and give you the upsides as well
first of all i was scheduled to arrive the day hurricane sandy hit my flight was canceled and i had to reschedule despite the hotels written policy that id have to pay for the full reservation not just one night if i did not cancel over a day in advance they graciously let me move my reservation without penalty but the new days i was planning to stay were significantly more expensive because they coincided with the marathon the person i was speaking to on the phone was so so so flustered i could barely understand him because he seemed very rattled i found out later that it was how he always communicates he the manager is a very difficult person to deal with treat this man with kid gloves hes temperamental and overly defensive he might actually mean well but his demeanor is unpleasant because of the weather my flight was cancelled again and although i called and explained it was not noted or changed luckily one of the other employees called me when i didnt show up when they expected me and i got the new reservations straightened out 
the website states that the rooms start at  per night but i was paying a whopping  because my trip got pushed to marathon weekend and everyone else was sold out this is more than ive paid to stay at the plaza hotel in ny and the room they gave us was a horror show check the pictures it was microscopic it had a very very small bed for two people the bed was shoved against the wall it was hard as a rock the pillows were too fat and also hard so i couldnt use them at all after trying to sleep for  hours with no luck i got a towel and tried to use it as a pillow it was pretty hard as well i would have been more comfortable on the floor if there had been any room the next day i went to kmart and bought my own pillow
i also felt itchy in the bed i havent looked this hotel up on the bedbug website because im actually afraid to know but i suspect oh do i suspect
the bathroom was so narrow that your shoulders will touch the wall on either side of the toilet i never even looked in the shower there was no tub the toilet made a very loud flushing type noise every  seconds or so all night long it was like loud waves crashing 
the hallways are not carpeted they actually have nice inlaid wood floors but this amplifies every noise that occurs in the hall we were near the elevator and we had to hear every drunk person who stumbled in all night long and in the morning there was the cleaning staff having long loud conversations for our entertainment
i think they gave us the worst room they had for the highest price 
i spent the whole night agonizing about what to do should i ask for another room or should i ask for a reduction in price  considering the marathon was canceled ultimately i politely and meekly asked for another room the manager was very offended and treated me very rudely but he did give me another room he had me pack up immediately and bring all my bags down he couldnt tell me when the new room would be ready so we had to spend a whole day without having had a shower when we returned much later in the day he had the bags in our new room it was of a decent size it had the same small hard bed but at least one of us wasnt smashed up against the wall and the toilet didnt run and it had a tub so it was worth the base price of

shuttle service  some of the drivers seem to have a real attitude problem driving by us without stopping after requesting pick up arguing loudly over their radio while others were friendly and helpful usual wait for shuttle was  minutes
food  room service was slow  min then one plate was forgotten which took another  minutes food was mediocre at best certainly not worth the price delivery person was very friendly though tried to eat breakfast at the hotel but it was a  minute wait  so we opted to eat in town
did not use fitness facilitiies tried to print out boarding passes but the computer terminal for doing so was not working  per device per day is unreasonablly high for internet access in my estimation having the water taxi right next to the hotel is convenient but a pricey alternative to get into town

i recently stayed at the sheraton downtown hotel in denver colorado as i was attending a conference at the hotel
i stayed in a room on the th floor of the tower building there are  main buildings in the hotel the plaza building and the tower building they are connected either via the walkway on level  or via the concourse level below ground
i had read other reviews of the hotel and most people make some complaints about the tower building suggesting it is better to be in the plaza building with that in mind i had asked the hotel to locate me in the plaza building however that did not occur there was no explanation upon my checkin as to why they were unable to meet this request in deed at the time i checked in there was no acknowledgement that i was an spg member and i often stay at spg hotels i assume the whole concepts of spg membership is to seek loyalty however with no acknowledgement etc they certainly dont make you feel valued in any way
in any event my stay was in the tower building the rooms in the tower building and the plaza building were apparently renovated at the same time the tower building is a fair distance from the hotel lobby and it is often much quicker to go to the street level and walk across the road rather than go to level  and walk across the connecting walkway the benefit of the tower building is that the gym is on the ground level of that building the gym is well equipped and quite good
the room at the hotel was ok i had a king size bed that was comfortable there is no refrigerator provided in the room which i find really odd and similarly there was no minibar or snacks provided to purchase i wanted a small refrigerator and one was delivered to my room the desk setup in the room is a little odd there is a main desk and then an oval shaped desk which slides under the main desk all seemed a little odd
the airconditioner system in the room was very noisy and i had significant difficulty in working out how to turn it off and night so i could sleep still dont know how i managed to turn it off but once i did i just left it off for my whole stay of  nights i am quite technically minded however there was no onoff switch or anything similar
the bathroom was extremely small there is a shower over bath and barely enough room to stand on the floor outside the bath and in front of the vanity unit with the bathroom door shut when you shower the whole mirror fogs up as there is a lack of sufficient ventilation hotels these days make little investment in quality toiletry products and the sheraton is no exception if you like good products shower gel and shampoo etc then bring your own
the rooms whilst comfortable need updating and are a little tired
you have to pay for internet connection in your room which in this day and age seems a little odd i paid for the highest speed wireless connection at  a day there is free internet in the lobby area of the hotel however i needed access from my room so i could work
a number of people have commented on how quick the lifts are wellyes they move quickly between the ground floor and the th floor however my experience was that you always had to wait many minutes for a lift to arrive because of this the lifts were always full and it felt like we stopped at every floor there are  lifts in the tower building which sounds sufficient however there was always a long wait
when i checked out the lady at reception simply said that there was a zero balance i had already provided my credit card and that they would email me a copy of the invoice whilst still at the hotel i checked my email and a copy of the invoice and noticed that they had charged me twice for the internet usage i then went back to reception where they rectified this in hindsight i am surprised that they did not show me a copy of the invoice and ask for confirmation of the expenses before they charged my credit card

the bathroom was the nicest part of the room with a upscale contemporary look and rock shower

 failure to honor a reservation even though a special room was requested at time of reservation and even though i called the afternoon i was to arrive to verify that special room request when i arrived at  pm the room was not available there is nothing we can do we are full
 when i arrived in the room th floor west tower the room reeked of cigarette smoke  really yes really even in  and those f you who have had this know that nothing can be done i did call  i told my story and then was sent to a second person to tell the entire story a second time  the first offer was we will have housekeeping come and spray of course those of us who travel frequently know this will not work then if you can leave the room for a couple of hours we can put a machine in there leave the room not possible then  certainly the next day well we could buy you dinner and then you could return to the room again i had work to do not time to sit alone for two hours in a restaurant waiting for the room to be deodorized and of course they were full nothing could be done
 room service  the first night  to begin with i was on hold for  minutes  at  pm and then i ordered tomato soup a reuben with fruit as the side choice and a glass of chianti ten minutes later i was called and told they did not serve the tomato soup any more and it should not have been on the menu i was offered tortilla soup five minutes later called to be told they were out of tortilla soup it was st patricks day and they offered me irish stew  i chose the chicken soup and yes there was one more call  minutes later i was called and told that i had an old menu and that they did not serve the chianti by the glass any more well that was quite an experience

in the room  the feel is that of uber luxury  the great gatsby roaring s theme really jumps out  the attention to detail is meticulous now the lighting blinds tv and toilet in the room were all extremely confusing it would have been nice if someone were to walk me through everything i spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out both the console phone and their magic toilet which apparently is a heated seat with all sorts of other features turns out that mine was actually broken 
anyhow i had called and asked for a charger for my phone  it never came i had to call back a second time  this time my butler picked up and brought it the woman who picked up the first time was extremely rude and sour anyways the bed is amazing probably the best bed ive ever slept in
anyways the next morning as im getting ready i asked for an iron and an ironing board the same woman from yesterday picked up i waited  minutes before deciding to just hop into the shower wasnt there when i got back had to call again wait  more minutes and my butler brought it luckily i didnt need to be anywhere exactly at  but if i had that would have been a huge problem
when i returned i mentioned these points along w the dysfunctional electronics to the woman at the front desk she was very understanding asked if i knew who picked up the phone both times i didnt and offered to move my room to a suite with a terrace she also sent up   certificates to use in their restaurantbar i appreciated that of course the nd room was even better obviously the terrace was fantastic  very private with a lot of large plants around it was a warm day in nyc with light drizzling
this room had a functioning toilet with all the gadgets i would also like to mention that the showers are great rain showers although the sinks are a bit odd overall probably the most luxurious room ive been in really just something you have to see for yourself

checking into the room was fast and easy and the person at the front desk was very helpful i was able to get a room with  full size bedswhich is what i wanted but at the time of booking there were nonavailable i had just gotten off work and wanted to at least take a nap before i went out that same night but was not able to do so for the fact that the cable guy was i guess fixing the cable in my room
once i was able to actually go inside my room i was very surprised to see that it was extremely clean i inspected the entire room and saw no signs of any dirt which was a plus in my book the room was very nice though the beds were a bit smallfull size instead of queen it had a table and  chairs microwave mini refrigerator and a  inch plasma tv the bathroom was nicely remodeled as well the only thing i would suggest is to ditch the comforter on the bed that thing was extremely itchy i didnt even use it because of this problem to be very honest i would get rid of the linen as well because that too was also irritating my skin
the location of the motel is perfect because it is surrounded by a lot of food places such as mcdonalds jack in the box carls jretc and if you want to have a sit down dinner there are restaurants maybe  minutes down pch

as for the hotel itself it was comfortable although the heating took some getting used to the room  was a decent size although the view was restricted  but for me part of the experience of new york was being amongst the skyscrapers the bathroom was small think travellodge but adequate the beds were very comfortable and the tv gave you access to more than you will possibly want although we hardly watched anything too much to see  do
on a negative note the decor was a bit tired and could do with a revamp but it was clean and housekeeping looked after us well enough there were no coffeemaking facilities in the room but a coffee maker was provided on request with no fuss
generally staff were pleasant and helpful although in truth the only request we made of them was to get us a cab to the airport when it came trime to leave

this was one of  hotels stayed at during the past  weeks travelling round the states one night in nyc staying heree and that was enough i checked in late evening after a long flight and the lady was very pleasent she put me on the concierge floor which i thought intimated something special  the bags of rubbish and old housekeeping laundry still hanging about the corridor was not impressive the room was a decent size but thats where it collapsed tiles were cracking off the walls in the bathroom and the hanging space minimal it was  degrees and the ac was an antiquated metal box under the window which howled during the night  a choice between too hot to sleep or too loud to sleep
check out was an experience the first person frank on the name badge just told me to go away and get back to wait until he was ready his collegue lady with frizzy hair had a i couldnt give a  attitude when i mentioned the issues apparantly there was no  concierge floor so i have no idea why i was told this it was obvious that paying guests were really nothing more than an inconvenience the final straw was the  plus service for the hotel to hold my bag for  hours

the w lakeshore is an interesting property im rating this based on my experience and not what i think the standard experience is when checking in due to our platinum status and the fact that my wife and i were celebrating our anniversary we were upgraded to a marvelous suite facing the lake the view was terrific and the suite was beautiful and spacious it did look a little loved and worn in places we had a powder room off the main entrance a spacious living room with wetbar and big windows looking over the lake the location is terrific across from navy pier and  miuntes to michigan avenue 
when i was looking at the floorplans the standard rooms looked fairly small  and the bathrooms very small but our suite had quite a large bathroom with separate shower which was quite nice and spacious with a view all the way out the window to the lake no less
its clear that this hotel was something much more standard that the w shined up the lobby is a neat place a standard hotel lobby during the day turned bar and meeting space in teh evening we also had drinks on the rooftop bar which was sleepy mid week but a good view and comfortable atmosphere 
the complimentary acura car service was terrific  we took it out to wrigley field for the cubs game i just wish they came to get you but alas its only oneway service 
we had a nice breakfast in the lobby the next morning and it was mostly filled with young businessmen i think the hotel loosens up on the weekends and id like to see that sometime

we had booked a suite several weeks in advance for my sisters bachelorette party basically for all girls to have a meeting place time to get ready area to have gift exchange and appetizers before we all headed out on the town for fun festivities and of course a place the a few us to stay after 
check in was great and without a problem room space was pleasant and everything appeared to be perfect then the ladies started to arrive for our gift exchange we had about  ladies in a suite which had adequate space but we soon realized it was getting extremely hot in the room also as guests arrived we noticed water leaking from the ceiling directly above the front door we decided to call the front desk for maintenance maintenance personnel responded promptly he stated the ac unit had frozen over which is why the room was so hot and stuffy the water leak was coming from the condensation maintenance explained this was a hvac room that has been having ac issues and they were all well aware of the maintenance tech was shocked it was not expressed to us at check in or that the room wasnt offered at the discounted rate per the tech only way to solve issue was to crack the heater on high to defrost the ac as the room was already hot plus it was  degrees outside we did not want the heater on we were also were in the middle of gift exchange which involved lots of lingerie so it was a little uncomfortable to have a male present we were offered a bottle of champagne but was never delivered 
when we went to the front desk to resolve our issues we were less the satisfied with both the level of service of mod and the lack of accommodations that were offered actually we were threaten instead by alexandra not sure if the name was correct but she introduced herself as the manager on duty but then later retracted that statement as she was only training we were told that the hotel was full house and the only room they move us too would be a regular room nothing else we paid for a suite so a smaller at the same rack rate wouldnt really be ideal but manager on duty or should i say employee in training since she is in training she does not know how to change room rate which we found odd as the hotel was completely full on a saturday night and they only had a person in training nothing else was done or offered made us feel like we were more of a hassle then paying customers we had planned on dealing with an actual manager the next upon check out but surprise surprise it was the same women as the night before she didnt ask how our night turned out after our whole experience 
since our experience i have called numerous times with no call back or follow up i have sent emails with no response i have even placed a complaint with the local bbb and they did not even get a response it is obvious this company does not care about the integrity patrons or reputation and all i can say is i will never stay at another marriott own facility and i highly recommend staying elsewhere especially if you are looking for a hassle free stay
 when i mentioned were threaten was because we had decline the smaller room and told the training mod we needed better accommodation she said she would call the fire marshal because we had  girls in a room that is meant for  mind you we were not all staying just doing gift exchange and eating but insisted she could have us all escorted out excuse me i asked for supporting documentation which was not provided trying to not get outrageously angry i advised her to go ahead and call the fire marshal if thats what needed to be done how is the world does someone threaten a patron when they are a paying customers not getting what they paid for worst customer service agent ever comical she is a manager in training",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

only complain i have is that we had been charged or parking and food we didnt usebuy  but we got that straightened out no problem  i am pretty sure that happened on a sunday when random people showed up to the pool party and charged a room  i wish the w had better security regarding charging things on a rooms bill they should ask for a last name and double check that is correct maybe not only the room number anybody would just say any room number and sign it good thing is everything got straightened out though and we werent charged for food we didnt consume and parking we didnt use

"location only with zero extras
the milford plaza is a historic hotel and has always been known for its great location it is literally right next door to shubert alley and most of the broadway theaters and times square and restaurant row are a fiveminute walk away it is in a safe area right in the middle of everything with convenient subway access unfortunately the property had become run down and is in the process of a muchneeded facelift as a result room rates are a bargain compared to many area hotels and i gave the property a try over a long weekend in midseptember 
if you strictly want a prime location with no amenities the milford might be a good choice for you i myself like and have come to rely on some of the basic amenities most hotels offer and found the lack of extras at the milford a hassle milfords management has eliminated extras that they feel guests dont necessarily want for example like coffeemakers in the rooms they will tell you that there is a starbucks a block down the street and there is but there was always at least a twentyminute line there and you have to leave the room and the hotel and walk there to get it thus i would recommend reading up on the property carefully and deciding whats important and costeffective for you here are some pros cons and warnings from my experience
pros
 my room was immaculately clean and the maids whom i encountered were very helpful and friendly
 room size  some reviewers have complained about the small size but i found them to be as big or bigger than many more expensive hotels in the area its nyc people unless you have a suite at the plaza your room will be small my room had a desk which you dont always get 
 elevators are small in size but fast at the milford you type in your room number and are prompted as to which elevator you get into no waiting while it stops at every floor most of the time i went directly up or down to my room with no waits 
 blackout shades really do block out most of the light from the times square area up the street
 beds were super comfortable
cons
 major noise and mess due to the renovation in the lobby i was woken up by noise from the remodeling almost every day of my stay and needless to say the hotels ambience was neither relaxing or visually appealing
 staff the attitude of the reception and bell staff is resigned indifference with just a few exceptions i felt like i was treated as a hindrance not a guest one of the managers christine was great when i had a problem with phone charges she was pleasant addressed my concern on the spot and was an outstanding representative of this property youd expect that everyone directly working with guests would be like her but that wasnt the case i kept getting met with indifference and thought that the people were just having a bad day then on other occasions id interact with the same staff and got the same attitude i noticed that hardly any of the staff smiled and during my whole stay none of them initiated any contact with guests like wishing somebody a good day most of the staff acted as if i annoyed them if i asked for anything
 door personnel were brusque and rude i had arranged for a car to pick me up for a return trip to the airport i was waiting outside and watching for the driver and had asked the doorman to please flag him down when he came so that i could get in right away instead the driver was directed across the block by the doorman and i almost missed my flight the driver told me that he and others who work for his company have had similar problems in the past with this hotel
 the halls and rooms are supposed to be renovated but lighting in the halls are dingy and the whole area is dark except for fullcolor murals of nyc street scenes in various places i understand theyre going for an urban look but i was on the tenth floor and the mural by the elevators is of a storefront with stacks of old books and magazines by the curb in front of it i can see the same sight by the dumpsters down the street and i didnt find it particularly pleasant to look at every day even though the hall carpet is supposed to be new there was numerous stains including a huge splatter of something right in front of my room door rooms have exposed beams and felt like being in a dorm
checkin was a hassle you have to drag your luggage up a flight of stairs as it is not on ground level once there there are seven kiosks but i never saw more than two of them staffed at a time and i was there on a weekend there was always a line and nobody in it seemed very pleased the downstairs area with luggage checkin was crowded and noisy all the time it felt like standing around in a bus terminal or the dmv i had a problem with my plastic key card and had to get it changed four times in three days each time was another  minute wait in the line at the desk
 there are no refrigerators in the rooms you can get one but you must request it 
 there are no coffeemakers in the rooms i didnt see any available for guests in the lobby either 
 there is no restaurant or bar for meeting people within the hotel
 no free internet in the rooms there is a kiosk with several printers in the noisy and crowded checkout area you can print out boarding passes and flight itineraries for free but you pay by the minute for additional websurfing there were usually people lined up to use them so dont wait until the last minute if you need to print out flight information
 rooms have no luggage racks this seems like a small detail but there are very few places to put your suitcases if you dont want to leave them right on the floor 
 beware phone charges there is no charge for an incoming call but you will be charged  for each outgoing call even local ones if you dont have a cell phone this adds up very fast 
during my stay on a daily basis i heard people in the elevators lobby or halls saying that they would never stay at this hotel again to be fair i can only speak from my own experiences 
overall if you are a traveler who strictly uses your hotel room as a place to sleep and is only interested in a clean room in a safe and convenient location the milford could be for you if you like the convenience of free internet in your room a place to get a meal without leaving the property and other amenities i mentioned there are comparable hotels in the area where you can get them at about the same room rate as the milford i was bothered by the noise the mess and chaos of the construction and the attitude of the staff and will be choosing elsewhere the next time im in nyc",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

the air conditioning system is independent in each room and is super noisy so the choice you have at night is dont sleep because of the heat or dont sleep because of the ac noise
the housekeeping staff is very slow they usually cleaned my room around  or pm so if you want to come back to your room after a long day in the city and before going out for dinner forget it your room will still not be cleaned

we booked through fhr amex program so we got an early checkin and got upgraded to a balcony room it had a nice view of the city side although i must say i am not very impressed with the sa skyline is there one the only issue we had was they forgot about our perks for booking through amex and i had to stop at the front desk  times to make sure i got the envelope with our benefits it seemed they were very overworked with all the people coming in over memorial day  but they were friendly and helpful when i did talk to them
chairs were hard to come by the pool the weekend we went but we got lucky and snagged some chairs in the morning both days in the adult only area i did see a lot of people looking for chairs though and felt bad they did not have enough however less chairs meant the adult area was relatively quiet and away from the craziness of the kids pools which we never went servers came out every  minutes or so the check on any orders or anything we need
the restaurants were excellent brannons food was pretty good but our server was excellent and made the meal better francescos at sunset was even better as they had a table with a perfect view of the sunset fitting name the food was prepared well and service was just as good expensive though but i guess its a hotel right
pretty much the only resort activity we found is the pool area i know there was a nature hiking trail but we did not try that since our goal was to relax  i would only come back here when there are less people offseason and if i was planning on golfing which i heard is amazing from the people there",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0
"nice hotel in good location
this was our first time to stay at the magnolia great location for downtown area all the staff were very nice and accommodating to every request the valet parking may seem a little pricey but worth it the room was very large with great water pressure in shower we stayed on the st floor and it was very quiet an older building with character and chic relaxing decor inside good rates for such a classy hotel would stay here again cookies and milk are nice touch for bedtime",4.0,4,0.0,0.0
"i would come back
we only needed to stay one night and did not want to pay for an expensive hotel i found it very cheap and i was very hesitant but i was extremely surprised when i arrived 
the reception was really nice and the staff was very helpful i was even more surprised when i got into the room it was small but perfect for two people but very clean there was also full cable which is something that you dont even see at the hilton unless you pay for it everything exceeded our expectation especially for the price 
i would recommend this hotel the only downside we did not have a car and there are not any restaurants that are nearby they also do not have a shuttle so you need to find your own transportation to the airport it was  bucks from there to the airport",5.0,3,-2.0,2.0
"pack earplugs
good points first this hotel is close to the ohare airport this will also be a bad point the bed was comfortable and the sheets and towels were very soft the fridge and microwave came in handy the front desk staff was okay all young and immature bad points the entire hotel needs an upgrade the curtains and furniture were filthy and the noise was intolerable i went to walgreens and prompty purchased high grade ear plugs to block the constant airplane noise as well as the noisy hallway and adjacent rooms the hotel has poor insulation and you can hear people talking in other rooms but again earplugs was my answer the pool was not filled this is okay for an overnight jaunt but unfortunately i stayed there a lot longer you can catch the blue line l  cattycorner from the hotel then switch to the red line at jackson to get into the city i did this everyday and had no problem getting around buy a cta pass for best value hop on and off all busses and trains there is a dominicks grocery a short walk north of the hotel a good chicago eat fairly close to the holiday inn is ginos east but i like to go to rogers park for more diverse and authentic food find something unique off of devon howard or clark street from jamaican to mediterranean food",2.0,2,0.0,0.0
"average accommodations
these are basic accommodations we booked  rooms one with two queens and one with a king both had an unpleasant odor kind of musty sickly sweet i told the person at the desk when we left and both had ac units with very loud buzzing and rattling sounds the noise of the ac units did drown out any other noises so that was good carpet was kind of nasty looking the bathrooms were nice and clean there is a convenience store across the street which isconvenient and it is just two minutes from downtown that was handy as we were there to attend a downtown event otherwise pretty basic for the price but i guess phoenix is expensive",2.0,3,1.0,1.0
"bad doesnt even describe it
at first room looked old with layers of paint on everything after closer view carpet was old worn and dirty bed had only  sheet over mattress without a mattress pad and  sheet to cover with dirty lamp and air conditioning unit in window bathroom had been redone recently so it looked okay
next morning went to take a shower  no hot water went to call down to desk  phone didnt work was plugged in but dead took a very cold shower after running water for over  minutes thinking it would get hot then went down to desk to check out
told guy behind desk about water his response you have to run the water for  minutes for the hot water to get up to the upper floors told him i did but also phone didnt work he kept repeating himself i told him i would take care of the issue myself with my credit card company

"not up to hilton standards
our stay was a total disaster from the moment we arrived check in was quick and efficient but as soon as we got to our room we couldnt get in we were with a bellman as all luggage transports are locked up and chained and you must use a bellman to transport your baggage i tried my key card five times and the door would not budge finally mike tried and on his third try while using his shoulder the door finally opened he told us that the doors sometimes stick and that it should work fine after wrongour nightmare begins after we put our luggage away we were ready to explore the resort but had difficulty getting out of the room the door would just not open after several attempts we were out and i went to the front desk to explain our dilemma we were assured the door would be repaired by the time we returned from the water park we returned  hours later and the door was still inoperable i called the front desk again and spoke to tyler i explained i was in phoenix with my daughter and her three children her oldest child is being seen at phoenix hospital on a monthly basis and this was supposed to be a mini vacation for her before her treatments i flew in from florida and my daughter drove from las cruces new mexico he apologized profusely asked if we were going to dinner and assured us that the door would be fixed by the time we got back while getting dressed tyler sent up milk and cookies for the girls and gave us a certificate to use for dinner which was very thoughtful we left for dinner and when we returned a worker named harry was finishing up the door and told us it was fixed we turned in for the night in the morning we could not get out of the room again and had to call down to have someone open the door for us i was very upset as this was a fire hazard and we could of been trapped in the room with no way out this worker told us that the door could not be fixed and they would need to change our room after changing our room i requested that the previous night be comped as we did not have use of the room for most of the day and was told that i would be given  off i felt this was not adequate and had the manager call me he finally comped the room i know this is a long review but my frustation has not subsided
we cut our stay  night on the day of our departure we waited for over half an hour to have our luggage brought down we finally lugged our bags ourselves i am highly disappointed with the resort and would not recommend it to anyone i expect more from hilton i am a gold member and have traveled all over the united states and always at a hilton this resort leaves a lot to be desired",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

"very disappointing
i had read all reviews from this hotel and was really disappointed we had travelled across arizona nevada and califirnia and clearly you get less for your money in san francisco one of the reviews mentioned asking for a room with a view i was allocated a room on the fourth floor and the receptionist found me another on the th floor the view was overlooking macys but was really just a roof top and no view it was continously noisy outside with construction work going on through the day  night the rooms were very dated and small as were the corridors there was a step up to the bathroom and the toilet was right behind the door  only word i can use is pokey there was no air conditioning only ceiling fans no coffee maker in the room and the bar closed at  on the plus side the location is excellent with the cable car passing the front door shops on the door step and the att baseball stadium is walkable the hotel put on free coffee and cookies in the lobby which was nice i am absolutely astounded that this hotel is so highly rated on trip adviser and really cant understand why",2.0,2,0.0,0.0
"decent space hot jacuzzi and lots of complimentary food and drink  great weekend
 of us stayed in a br suite  queen beds in bedroom and enjoyed our  weekend nights and had a great time lots of great points and just a few notsogreat ones

breakfast is bountiful and cocktail hour features wine and beer as well as a small selection of cocktails including a cocktail of the day munchies one night were fresh veggies and dip yum plus stack food pretzels and goldfish  colored tortilla chips melted cheesesalsasour cream and the requisite pretzels were snacks on the nd night 
the pool was warm and the jacuzzi was hot and perfect and open until midnighta delightful way to end a long day of touring
breakfast was decent with a hot buffet pastries rather pedestrian but serviceable cereals juices and wonderfully hot and strong coffee service was excellent from bellman to front desk folks to bartenders to pool staff a woman who swept up the pool area around  pm was pleasant friendly and swept at a brisk competent pace staff seemed genuinely nice 
at pm and at am hotel staff give out fish food to feed the giant koi grab a container and have fun feeding these giant goldfish
minuses parking garage was tight almost always full with small narrow spaces to park inif you have a large car or suv beware its also expensive  per day but its impossible to find street parking in the neighborhood so if you drove there you have no choice 
the hotel was very busy so kids running around and noise at breakfast and at cocktail hour was the norm as were longish lines for cocktails evening or custommade omelets boring 
apples on the front desk were a great bonus but one day they ran out and were not replenished  and the next day they were mushymealy a nice touch for surejust not a very tasty one

service was excellent friendly staff safe parking room was very small bathroom was micro

"a penthouse view is all youll get
on a recent visit to los angeles for several stanley cup final games my husband and i booked an executive suite at the century city regency plaza hyatt we had booked the same type of room from a previous visit which worked out well
this time though upon arrival i was informed that as a platinum member of hyatts passport club i was upgraded to their penthouse wow impressive right
wrong dead wrong the penthouse was a dilapitated two room affair with the following
a black corner couch
a dresser with a tv
a desk
a bed
a barsafe bureau
a chair
closet doors were misfit and creaky the door knobtowood circular protectors were embarrasingly loose on the doors and the carpet and walls were stained
this room was so depressing and vacant of all charm that i couldnt help but remark to hubby that there are thirdworld gulags prisons furnished better than this penthouse i do not understand how the hyatt could charge more than  a night for a room no better than a hollywood blvd vagabond hotel
upon checkin the desk clerk asked if i wanted a newspaper delivered each morning to the room and i asked which paper the answer the wall street journala paper i find as offensive as the rest of the murdoch empire  but thats just my cranky preference so i asked for the la times and the clerk said in typical modspeak no problem
of course every morning for three mornings i received the wall street journal every morning i returned the paper to the front desk and asked for the la times to be delivered for the next day it was a problem i gave up on it the last morning
i returned to la a week later to watch the final hockey game of the season at staples center and i booked us at the ritzcarlton across the street i was upgraded to a penthouse naturally and guess what the ritzcarlton understands what the word penthouse means i have never been treated better at a hotel i am in the process of writing up that review
now i have had excellent rooms at other hyatts the park regency in chicago the embarcadero hyatt in san francisco the hyatt in ft lauderdale 
as for the century city plaza hyatt the view was great but i wont be back until they fire the hotel manager and refurbish the placeespecially the penthouses for goodness sakes this is century city and its the plaza hotel

booked a three night stay at the hyatt  lex using points the hotel so new that we had to tell the cab driver twice the name and location of it the entrance and lobby definitely had a small boutique hotel feel so no bellhop the front desk staff was very friendly given us the full list of amenities available when i asked about whether wifi access would be complimentaryhaving just been given hyatt platinum status the day prior unfortuntely my status still showed as gold but he offered to take care of it and that it would include access for two devicesfor me and my wife 
elevator service is a bit slow given only being two elevators for  floors it often took a couple of swipes of the room keycard to allow us to select our floor in the elevator each level seemed to have only a handful of rooms due to the small footprint of the building 
our lexington studio appeared clean the room was shaped like a narrow rectangle making it feel small sometimes due to room layout the placement of the two  lcds made for poor viewing angles when in bed the tv is at directly  degrees to the bed mount on the wall just to the right of the bedwhen laying down fortunately the tv does swivel slightly less than  degrees 
the decor overall was not bad with the exception of a low quality wood veneer tventertainment stand below the tv there was a nice alarm clockipod speaker system on the nightstand that allow for convenient iphone charging there were two nice reading lights next to the headboard on each side of the bed there was a small fridge stocked with a few items but with enough room to store a few our of own drinks there was also a microwave and surprisingly nice fisher and paykel small dishwasher not sure what anyone would be washing since they dont provide any dishware beyond a couple of glasses the nespresso coffee maker received high marks from my wife
the bed was firm and comfortable the bedding is my preferred style generic white comfortable with plain sheets surrounding itmuch preferrable to the quilted unchanged ones that you have to just throw on the floor as soon as you can
the bathroom was above average in size and quality with a glassenclosed shower the toiletries were below averageor so my wife says

mixed review on this place the price is better than most and the location is nice if youre looking to be near time square and close to a subway entrance but as youll see below management is not responsive to their customers i emailed ihg and told them of my bad experience and how i heard nothing back from management i told them id love to give them a chance to respond so i didnt have to post this review they put me in touch with someone who guess what didnt respond to my call
my review is more with the customer service they put on a big show at the front and i thought i was going to get what i have come to expect from the intercontinental hotels and the reason i have chosen as of this year to direct all my loyalty from another award program to ihg
so at the airport i realized i made the dreaded mistake of leaving my phone charger plugged into the wall of my room i emailed the hotel about my charger providing my name room number and priority club rewards seeing if there would be any way to send it to me noting i would be happy to pay shipping charges i quickly got a response that seemed promising asking for a bit more detail i provided the woman the information and heard nothing emailed a week later for follow up and still nothing called and got the run around and now a month later am not only without my charger but without a return email to say yes we will return it or no we wont 
here is the most telling part of their customer service i even went to ihg corporate and emailed them saying i had a frustrating experience and would love to give them a chance to address it before i posted this review they put me in touch with a manager who emailed me saying he would like to speak and when i called and missed him he never returned the call how many times do you give a hotel a chance to excel in customer service in my case it seemed like one too many

i generally enjoy staying at a boutique hotel when im traveling outside of the country or to a beach when im in new york city i tend to stick with chain hotels as there are certain comforts that i rely on at the end of a busy day and boutique hotels do not always offer these comforts
i was so surprised to find a unique comfortable and affordable hotel that also offered creature comforts that are usually only found in larger more traditional hotels checkin at the night hotel was professional and quick there was an interesting ambience in the lobby with quiet activity and hospitality i was offered assistance to get my bags to my room and i was pleasantly surprised at how clean fresh and welcoming the decor appeared 
the room design is striking the headboard of the bed is quite a design statement the linens and bed is very comfortable and the bathroom offers all the amenities shampoo conditioner soaps hair dryer sewing kit there was a closet with a safe an umbrella and full length bathrobes in addition the room offered a small refrigerator and everything needed to open a bottle of wine or mix a cocktail no plastic glasses
though i rarely watch television the wall mounted television was high definition there were movies and plenty of channels i could borrow movies and games from the lobby if i desired or chose a movie to be billed to my room there was a desk plenty of outlets and plenty of comfortable pillows and did i mention the bose wave sound system it was so nice to come back to the room at the end of the day to quietly playing classical music low lighting and the bathrobe waiting on the bed
every employee  and i mean everyone  was professional attentive and helpful i felt completely safe and though i stayed on the second floor i had no issues with noise in fact i fell into bed each night and felt completely cocoonedsome of the best nights of sleep i have had in a hotel
the night is mere steps from times square and smack in the middle of the theater district  a welcome proximity as as woman walking back to the hotel alone after a broadway show there were restaurants and activities of every price point nearby and yet when you walked into the hotel there was a pervasive sense of calm that told you that you were homeat least for a little while
the night hotel is in a great destination spot but the hotel itself is worthy of a visit just to enjoy being pampered a bit the combination is unbeatable my son goes to college in new york city and i visit frequently from now on the night will be the only place that i will stay",5.0,5,0.0,0.0
"good value for money but rooms could use some updating
i stayed at the melrose hotel washington dc for a week long conference
on the plus side the hotel is well located near a number of good and very good restaurants the neighbourhood appears to be safe and fairly quiet it is one mile from the lincoln memorial and the rest of the mall a few blocks from the trendy and fashionable shops in georgetown and a short walk to the foggy bottom metro station the lobby bar and lounge area is attractive with a clean open and contemporary look the room rates for the conference were a bargain everyone we encountered from the doorman to the house keeping staff was very pleasant and helpful the concierge was very accommodating in moving me from a room with two doubles to a room with a king bed the latter room was particularly spacious
on the negative side the two different standard rooms i stayed in were both a bit tired looking the carpet was getting a dingy colour and the bathrooms are very small one of the bath tubs had a coating which was peeling the other had a stopper which did not work the dcor of the rooms were a bit old fashioned 
other details the rooms have a coffee maker and an empty mini refrigerator glasses in the room are plastic but i got wine glasses from the bar in the lobby and the housekeeping staff resupplied me with clean wine glasses each day the rooms were quiet for sleeping the beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning which was essential for the heat wave while i was there worked well 
we only tried the hotels continental breakfast which was fine the fitness center was cramped but offered a good range of equipment there is no pool
the hotel normally charges for wifi internet access although it was included with the conference rate rooms and the internet speed was good which sometimes is not the case with hotels with free internet
if i were picking my own hotel i might choose to pay more for a more upscale and contemporary looking place but based on the conference rate i received this hotel was excellent value for money",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

"convenient but overwhelmed
i had the unfortunate opportunity to stay at the grand hyatt dfw not by choice but by american airlines cancellation when the flight was cancelled we had to stay one more night in dallas we chose to stay at the airport grounds due to convenience the hotel is located in terminal d and is easily accessible by airport tram 
it turns out we werent the only people staying due to cancellation the check in staff reported she was out of king size beds but when we told her we had gold status she quickly found a room with a king bed ironic isnt it 
we were hungry and tried out the restaurant and were told there would be an hour wait it was easter sunday and american must have cancelled half of its flights the restaurant was poorly understaffed we sat at the bar and due to our exhaustion we ordered to go the bartender was very busy and impatient i realized whyshe was the only person tending to all the customers at the bar the snack area and the orders that the wait staff was putting in for drinks for the restaurant yes she was the only person she ran around flying from one end of the bar to the other and back again and slamming glasses and wine bottles around soon we noticed she was so backed up the wait staff started pouring their own wine and not to mention the piles of dirty wine glasses carafes plates sitting on top of the counter we sat for an hour waiting for our food to go we were lucky apparently people sitting down dining had a  hour wait maybe it was just a bad daynight we ran into another couple on the elevator who bought food from the snack bar they couldnt even get a plastic spoon thats how bad it was 
we proceeded to our room it was right across the elevators so you can hear everything the room was very modernized with a huge window that spanned the entire wall everything is electronic and with a touch of a button you can control the blinds the lights  etc the shower was quite small the size of one i would expect in city living such as dc there was a tub opposite of stand up shower that we didnt use the bed was firm too firm when we woke up at  am the next morning i hit the button soft light but it wasnt soft it turned on all the lights and blinded me instead the worse part was hearing people talking and walking throughout the night the rooms were fine just request away from elevator

"still a good hotelexpected better
in town for a wedding and brought a guest to show off my fabulous city and stay at what i thought was the finest hotel in indianapolis from my previous experience at the conrad two years ago i just knew it was the perfect choice to make a first impression on my friend after my stay this past weekend i am not so sure the conrad is living up to my expectations of a  star hotel
long story short my stay was a fridaysaturday night stay and for the time my guest and i stayed in the hotel room things were fine short of the minor thumping we heard from the housekeeping crew at various hours
my complaints were few but critical considering the property being one of the elite in the city
 valet service was horrible this is not an exaggeration but truth i was shocked to learn that the friday night we checked in valet was not accepting call downs for vehicles we had been told by front desk to call down if we needed to have the car brought up when i dialed down the service desk told me they were not accepting calls and we had to come downstairs to have our car pulled i was a little embarrassed i had boasted about the conrad all the way to indianapolis and i was quite surprised to start the night out with an inconvenience that should not have happened in a hotel of this caliber nonetheless we went downstairs to have the car pulled and it took about  minutes this is quite a high turnaround in my opinion but considering it was pm on a friday i let it go and chalked it up to rush hour unfortunately this ended up being the norm for the rest of the weekend of the  additional times i had my vehicle pulled only the last time was it under  minutes and the last time was checkout there was an obvious lack of staff and coordination out front the fact that im paying an additional  per night for parking made this issue  on my list if you are going to charge for a service set the expectation with the customer and if you cannot live up to it because of limited staffing or other reasons compensate your guests i did make a complaint to the front desk and was told they were totally booked and were just really busy though there were a few events going on downtown i dont believe that is an excuse when you are charging a premium price for a product and service not to mention indianapolis is a super bowl city
 telephone this is a small issue but i had to note it because once again this is a highcaliber hotel there were  phones in the room one on the desk one in the bathroom and one next to the bed the cordless next to the bed did not function we had to order room service from the phone by the desk which isnt a big deal but again one of those little things that a  star hotel wouldnt miss the room attendant that brought the food up laughed and just ignored it like it would go away on its own i would expect a paid employee for the hotel to at least notify someone to have the phone replaced right away the guests should not have to deal with such matters trivial but important to me when i am paying top  to stay at the finest in the city room  just in case any of the hotel staff happens to read this
 customer service my last stay here i felt extremely welcome and special this time not so much it was as if the a team packed up and left after the super bowl on this stay the hotel was staffed by a team that was not as engaged as i would expect which led to just an average experience for me and my guest i am very disappointed that my guest did not experience the hotel the way that i did for the first time

"rude staff noisy  lack luster
although a frequent business traveler to chicago this was the first time i stayed at the westin on michigan avenue unfortunately my first introduction to this hotel was riddled with problems which mainly point to issues with rude staff and poor housekeeping this will be my last visit to this belowpar property 
my stay started out on the wrong foot upon checkin i discovered the bathroom wasnt clean suffice to say that toilet was visibly used  unflushed the front desk manager quickly offered me an alternate room on the same floor this time however there was a dog barking at the top of his lungs next door the bellman who provided me the room keys also heard the noise and agreed that this would not be an acceptable room either the third assigned room appeared to be clean and noisefree  until early the next morning at am saturday i was jolted out of a sound sleep by all sorts of racket arising from slamming doors made by guests and housekeepers the physical makeup of the hotel rooms seems not to muffle outside hallway noise  regardless of the room i think i probably would have experienced the same annoying hallway noise so no sense in trying to change rooms again  i resorted to earplugs 
the physical hotel itself isnt anything to write home about although i was staying on one of the preferred floors it wasnt obvious to me that there was anything special about the hallways or rooms perhaps the bathrobe the room looked worn the furnishings looked beatup the bathroom ceiling has chipped paint from what looked like a previous flood the vanity in the bathroom needed to be repainted or replaced the only good thing was the bed which was comfortable  firm 
on the second day there i was temporarily leaving my room to grab a starbucks from the lobby and return to my room when a rude housekeeper barked at me and asked when i was leaving my room i had a do not disturb sign on the door i said i would be vacating the room around pm and would call housekeeping to let them know when i needed service in a confrontational manner she said well i have another floor to clean and will not be back here at  i indicated once again that i would call the housekeeping department when i was leaving the hotel which i did at approximately pm housekeeping said that they would send someone up to clean the room by the way the maids chart was parked in front of a room across the hallway as i left for the day the do not disturb sign was removed as i left the room when i returned to the hotel at am the room hadnt been serviced i called to the front desk and complained they sent up clean towels and replenished the coffee supplies for the coffeemaker the evening front desk manager also gave me a voucher for  to be used for room service to compensate me for the inconvenience i appreciated his gesture at trying to remediate the situation 
the final blow was at checkout  the front desk clerk was unbelievably rude and nasty especially when she was asked to research why the voucher for  for a room service comp didnt appear on my bill i had handy the receipt from room service which showed the credit i seriously thought she was going to bite my head off she wanted me to step aside and let her check other guests in first before she dealt with clearly up my bill issue even though i was rushing to meet a departing flight i brought this incident to the attention on the manager on duty who told me he would address the situation 
i really cant remember the last time i had such bad service in a hotel  especially in chicago wherein guest service is very good something is seriously wrong with either recruitment of good personnel and  or proper guest service training further the hotel could benefit from some rehab and tlc nothing special here my recommendation would be to avoid and use other hotels in the area 
followup to my visit  for the record the front desk manager sent me an email to apologize for my issue at checkout and added a poultry allotment starpoints to my starwood preferred account while a nice gesture better than nothing i suppose the points really didnt add up to much and hardly worth the effort or fanfare also for the record i didnt ask for any compensation refunds or discounts for any of my problems",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

my husband came and to ask about some of these vehicles that had noone in them that were parked in front of hotel he asked if they could be moved because it was preventing everyone from getting a car because they are double parked she told him no

horrible hotel worst ever stay at congress plaza hotel in chicago il
well to start off i would like to say that i have stayed in hundreds of hotels in which many of the stays were in chicago il and the congress plaza hotel was the nastiest and most horrible of them all i booked this hotel thinking since i was paying almost  a night it was going to be a very nice luxury stay and it was completely the opposite below describes my hotel stay
 i arrived at the hotel hoping like any other stay at any other hotel if they have rooms available they will allow you to check in early this hotel however was much different the front desk staff margarita was very rude and acted like it was a complete imposition for us to even be at the hotel early than expected so since we had a large amount of luggage our only option was to sit the lobby for  hours watching them laugh at us
 when i booked the hotel package it described the room in which it stated internet was included when i arrived at the hotel they told me it was not included it was an extra charge of  a day 
 finally when it was time to get to the room we arrived in a room that had a small odor not a huge deal we opened the windows to let the odor out the walls were very dirty and dingy the wallpaper is peeling and very badly stained with a yellow tint even though this was a nonsmoking room the carpets were stained and very old and dirty looking this was among the worst looking hotel room i have ever stayed in dont wear white socks in your room your socks will have a black bottom in no time
 after we unloaded all of our luggage i needed to get connected to the internet and i learned that it was not even wifi internet it was a wired connection that has about a foot cord slack attached to the wall next to a desk so my laptop could not even be where i wanted it in my room it had to be attached in the corner desk in the living room area the technician had to come up to the room a total of  different times during my stay to fix my rooms internet modem to make my internet work i moved rooms  times because of other issues and still had the same problems
 tv was not clear on all channels the tv is fuzzy and lines running through the screen in all rooms we stayed in which were    and 
 room temperature is controlled by the hotel the rooms only have an attached fan in the window that you can circulate outside air in the room the room was very cold at times
 to top it off the electric went off a total of  times in our room in which the second time the front desk guy told me that if i have too much plugged in at one time it will go off i told him that the only thing that was turned on was one lamp the tv and my laptop was plugged in he told me that i must have had other things plugged in as well because it wouldnt have just turned off for those items so anyways the electric went off  times during my stay once while i was in the shower really convenient and the others while i was watching tv or on the laptop 
 also there is only one entrance to the hotel and when we arrived we found about  protesters holding signs saying unite here and im on strike i later learned that these people have been doing this every day for the last  years so this hotel has a bad reputation among a very large crowd of people
 i changed rooms a total of three times and as a result of all my problems for a  hotel stay the hotel general manger  shakeel sibbiqui gave me a free hotel dinner valued at  for free when i asked for compensation on my stay he insisted that they gave me enough

whether it was little things like the safety latch on the door being broken or really nasty things like all of the chairs having mystery stains on them this room was just unacceptable one of the towels we had in our bathroom was stained as were the walls the floor the chairs and the nightstand the bathtub had a huge gap on the front between the wall and the tub and the calking around the tub was peeling off all around the tub the ceiling looks like it had repair work done from leaking pipes but they never really refinished the ceiling or put the trim back up the window sill was dirty and had lots of stains on it and the curtains wouldnt close completely

another problem came when we asked for late check out at  pm another perk of being a gold member they said no problem but then when it came to check out they asked us when we were checking out we told them  pm because thats one of the perks they said again that i wasnt a gold member i was mad at that point because either these people were knew or just not very smart i wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt again so after i hung i called the front desk again and asked for late check out and they said not a problem i told them someone just called and said i couldnt they apologized and said it was fine 
other than some of the front desk people not knowing what they are doing our stay was fine i think the hotel should really train their staff better in looking up information i would stay here again but if i experience this problem again i will make a formal complaint

based on the other reviews and photos i had high expectations for the palomar and booked it for our group flying in from toronto for a meeting i was a little surprised by how small and dark the hotel was my room was tiny and very cramped the king bed barely fit in the space and it was awkward manoeuvring around the bed to get to the closet etc and im a small person however some of my colleagues reported having spacious rooms so perhaps it was just my room i went to make coffee and realized there was not a coffee maker in the room which seemed odd as every hotel ive ever stayed in always provided one i called down to see if there was anywhere i could buy coffee in the hotel and they said theyd send a coffee maker up which they did so about  minutes later so problem was solvedbut it seemed odd that they wouldnt just have one already in the room you shouldnt have to ask i liked the idea of the animal print robes but when i looked at the ones provided they were really faded and worn lookingand that sort of brought forth the rather unappealing thought of how many others had worn that robe before mebut thats just me other than that our experience was okay the staff were polite and helpful the hotel bar was also small and kind of cramped but a happening placeso that made it good",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0
"worst westin experience ever
honestly whatever reviewers say really wont matter here the hotel has the best location in union square and im sure the owners and managers are quite aware of this meaning they dont have to fix up the old rooms address the paper thin walls or treat you with any courtesy whatsoever people will continue to book this hotel no matter what and they know it with that being said for those who have the choice stay elsewhere heres a brief rundown of what my husband and i encountered
 we booked through priceline and the front desk made us very aware of it and not in a good way we were put in the old building on the th floor in the smallest category of rooms they have i actually have never been in a room so tiny even when staying in new york city literally when we opened the door to the room the door hit the bed we tried to change rooms even offering to pay extra but we were dismissed saying they were soldout the entire weekend it was awful even on the th floor you could hear the  man team of protesters who were protesting the hotel next door i specifically asked to be put on a floor and room where i would not be subjected to this noise as i had read about it in previous reviews the snarky front desk guy told me i was in an inside room so we should be fine forget that he put us on the side of the building where the protesting was taking place it woke us up every morning promptly at am no need for an alarm clock here the bathroom was extremely small and had a barely working toilet the walls were so thin you could hear anything going on outside in the halls and including what was going on in the rooms next to you most notably those latenight sounds and knocking of headboards ugh disgusting
other than the room issues i became completely exasperated when the hotel did not let guests know that the chinese new year parade was going on that weekend i was completely oblivious when spending a full day at the farmers market ghiradelli square and fishermans wharf and upon returning at pm realized that we were completely blocked from all sides into entering the hotel because of the ongoing parade we were not allowed to cross the street until the parade was over we waited in the freezing cold for  hours i was furious when i asked the lady who greets people who are checking in about this her response to me was that they let everyone who checked in that day know that the parade was going to happen that day and that they may not have access it seemed completely lost to her that maybe they should have let everyone else know too i mean how hard would it have been for them to slip a flier under guests doors its things like that that ruin even a good experience but my stay was already marred so i could not wait to check out and get out of there
the only positive thing i have to say is that the concierge desk was always very helpful and the location is prime",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

this was my second visit from uk to new york with my wife and did a fair amount of research prior to our visit the hampton inn soho had favorable reviews and after staying there i can see why 
the most commendable aspect of the hotel was the endearing and friendly nature of all the hotel staff we arrived early prior to pm but lobby staff allowed us to bag drop whilst my wife and i explored the immediate area which is profoundly different from midtown where we stayed last time in new york the area is quieter less in your face and very chic there is an abundance of bars and restaurants to suit every taste and budget when we arrived back in the hotel the room was ready as promised when in the room it was spacious airy and very clean
 the size of the room was bigger than expected and compared well to flatotel where we stayed on our previous visit the wifi signal was good and allowed us to stay in touch with our daughter back in uk who declined to come due to the extensive walking that she may have to endure and this made a huge contribution to enjoying our stay
every time we entered or left the hotel the staff were courteous and always willing to assist on our last day of our visit lobby staff allowed us to store our luggage whilst we made the most of our remaining hours they also arranged for a private cab to the airport which arrived bang on time  i would highly recommend this service as opposed to hailing a cab and only  more to jfk my wifes main impression was the quality of the bed and bedding as she is a fussy sleeper  she said it was the best sleep she had had in a long while  so much so she wanted to change the pillows in our own bed to replicate the ones in the hampton inn

"so bad that sheraton dropped them
i have only two nice things to stay so i will start there 
 good location with friendly staff and 
 the beds are comfortable they still have sheraton beds although they are no longer a sheraton hotel
the bad 
 the ac didnt work in the rooms not only in my room but also in the three other rooms management and the hotel engineer very friendly men brought me to consider as alternatives first they tried to give me a whole song and dance about the motors how long it takes them to kick in etc when they realized i knew about the inner workings of an hvac these old units look like thoseinstalled in the ss they admitted that many of them just dont function properly i guess i should be grateful it was october and not june after two requests for a fan they brought me one and told me to open the windows on the st floor 
 the tub and sink were blocked up and the front desk and reception wouldnt answer calls from rooms so after my first shower i did not get another one as the tub was half full for the remainder of my stay gross 
we checked in on october  sheraton dumped this hotel effective october  and our checkout was october  chaos enused the internet never worked except in the lobby the front desk could not provide a receipt on checkout because they no longer had access to my reservation i was told to call sheraton and do the legwork myself folios were not provided under room doors so everyone had to stand in line to check out at times there were  parties in line and never more than two people working the desk 
summary this is an old rundown hotel with ownership that clearly was unwilling to conform to sheraton standards and was then kicked out of the sheratonstarwood brand the carpets are old and stained the bathrooms tiny the amenities barely acceptable the furniture agedbeaten and the plumbingutilities decrepit",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

 water pressure there isnt any and the hot water takes  minutes to get warm
 cleaners dont clean and barely make the bed
 room phone does not work at all
 the plug in the wash basin does not open or close we had to hold it open with a bobb pin

after three days of our room not being cleaned properly basic things like replacing the soap and shampooconditioner wiping down coffee table and cleaning sink as it wont drain properly which leaves soap and shaving scum i approached the desk and nicely requested that the room be cleaned to a higher standard i was basically flogged off and told they would fix didnt happen next day today  i was looking for a bottle opener as we wanted to share a bottle of wine and watch a movie and i could not locate one i then picked up the phone to request and the phone doesnt work i then went down stairs to reception and spoke to one of the managers who told me they dont supply bottle openers however she would lend me one at no charge as if she was doing me a favour evidently there is a service charge to use a bottle opener i thanked her and also told her about the phone sink water pressure and the state of the room and was basically dismissed after comming back to my room i opened a bottle of wine and sat back to watch a movie and you guessed it it doesnt work we are now waiting the the service man to come up to the room to have a look after my wife went back downstairs to tell reception  due to the phone not working

i did not eat at the hotel so cannot speak to the restaurants however i did check out the lobby bar and the rooftop lounge both were fine i expected a beer to be outrageously priced but they werent in either place i found that the lobby bar was more accommodating for a party of one but the rooftop lounge is definitely worth checking out

on the surface it looks like a hip and happening place to stay in the hotel is merely an afterthought serving its bar patrons seems paramount over accommodating hotel guests my friend and i stayed one sunday night in one of its suites in chronological order i will list items of poor hotel management 
 no bedding was provided for the futon couch in the living room in this two bedroom suite 
 the lighting in the bathroom was dim as candlelight and there was no ability to adjust it either by the sink and mirror or behind the door where the shower and toilet were
 the fixtures for holding the face towels near the sink two separate rings were both separated from the wall nearly falling off the paint was gone behind one and the other showed a cheap patch job had been attempted and failed
 the frosted glass screen separating the bathroom area from the bedroom had a large crack running through it from a point where itd been hit
 the shower had mold
 the shower leaked and there were an inadequate number of towels to mop it up and dry oneself
 the patio was grungy and littered it had three small tables and chairs made of plastic andor metal which looked like they were gotten from the  cent store they were grimy the large pot of the potted treebush had an empty cigarette carton and other bits of trash in it the painted grey cemented patio floor was ugly and needed to be mopped
 of three identical seats at the end of the bed one had most of its goat hair worn off of it
 the ladys room in the bathroom in the lobby was awful  and it was visited in the middle of the day on monday when there was no club scene going on

b the second stall had no lock
c the third stall had one of your typical metal garbage pails attached to the side for tampon disposal but this one was so gorged with plastic bag linings not only would the lid not close but you had to wrestle and untangle them to find an opening to discard your trash and then stuff it back in the giant wads of plastic bags the housekeeper crammed in the bin 
d club music playing all day long in the lobbylobby lounges so that you cant make a phone call or work in peace
 their complimentary breakfast in the lobby touted bagels and muffins as well as coffee from am until am but there were the following problems
a at am i saw that only bagels 
b there was only two inches of coffee in the pot and it smelled nearly burned 
c the toaster was missing one of its knobs 
d there were no plates or napkins 
e there were only three small cream pods left in a bowl 
f there was no staff present at the bar where the items were offered to ask for napkins plates or more creamer when i did find someone to ask the person searched and searched in cupboards in the lobby behind the bar could find nothing and offered me some cocktail napkins i asked why he couldnt just grab a plate from the restaurant they have in the hotel he looked at me as if hed never thought of it before and didnt know what to do and if he could do this i just asked if i could consolidate items in one of the big serving bowls to carry my two bagels orange and  coffees upstairs because i couldnt juggle them all with cocktail napkins
g of the two oranges and apple in the fruit bowl the apple had a large bruise and one of the oranges had a mushy area under a large enough area of its peel that i expected it was rotten inside
 the staff although polite give the impression that they dont take their jobs seriously andor lack training in guest services they are pleasant and helpful when you interact with them but each time i did i felt as if i was a stranger knocking on one of their apartment doors asking to borrow a cup of sugar they dont mind directing their attention away from what they are doing to serve you but it always felt as if what they were doing talking to other staff or perhaps on facebook was more interesting than taking care of you
 other details about the room i forgot to mention the do not disturb sign looked like it had been smashed in an elevator door there was a lid missing on the water well of the coffee maker there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom near the sink the hairdryer the hotel provided was grungy with clumps of dust on the screen on the back
its open for drinking until am and has a bar on the main level and a bar underground its a place to book a room and crash if youre too drunk to drive home from drinking in their bar it seems that the only reason the  hotel rooms exist

"great location but horrible service  fraudulent charge on card awaiting full resolution as promised
i will update this review once i receive the resolution i was promised by the gm i had the misfortune of staying here from  to  this hotel was the only bad thing about my first visit to san francisco but i thought that it would be the best aspect during my checkin with edwin and hugo however things went downhill quickly 
i found that my room could have been cleaner i really disliked finding condom wrappers in the trash can an ob tampon wrapper on the floor and a filthy rag on top of the ac unit however i would have let everything slide if housekeeping would not have been rude i had called to request forgotten toiletries and was given a stern lecture by rimel once he arrived an hour later i was chided for asking for too many items but he would hear no reasoning from me so if you stay here be aware that they give tubes of toothpaste not packets this may save you from beiing treated like you are that poor that you have to rely on the holiday inn to supply your toothpaste
the preceding was the beginning of a downhill spiral for me  my family at this hotel i spent hours dealing with management about the lack of respect that i was shown but things kept getting worse the slow internet was an afterthought for me when compared to the my dealings at this hotel including my little one hearing restaurant employee hector who i never even dealt with call me a derogatory name management not the gm told me at least the meal was free when i spoke of this issue itwas evident that management thought that gradual discounts would pacify me but all i wanted was respect i felt like i was purchasing a car when dealing with this hotel but the product that we were negotiating was to be treated right i did get the respect that i am used to from traveling  nights per year once i checked in somewhere else 
three days after checking out of the hotel i was stunned to learned that the night that was supposed to be free was mysteriously charged to the card they went back on their word i immediately called my bank to close the card i finally did get gm sheila martin on the phone and she was sympathetic and understanding but also unaware that i had any issues she did agree to refund my entire stay and called back to confirm however the card they issued the credit on is closed due to the unauthorized charge for one night from them my bank said that it will not go through and i have to give them my new card number at this point i only feel comfortable talking to the gm im hoping that i can get this resolved soon and will update my review once this is resolved

ill start by saying that the employees at the front desk were wonderful even when the city of seattle only gave them a moments notice that they were going to be shutting off the water from pm till am the employees were scrambling to get bottled water for the guests and notifying them of what was going on the beds were quite comfortable and the air conditioner was great the breakfast wasnt bad a bit more variety would have been nice but i still liked it the cons were the room was smaller than we expected the bathroom only had a small shower which couldnt regulate the temperature of the water as you were showering there was mold on the shower door and the water was very hard to shut off the tv was blurry like it was dying the maid service wasnt very good the bathroom floor wasnt cleaned the carpet wasnt vacuumed daily nor was the desk or the bedside tables cleaned we would use the coffee but they didnt replace it everyday the coffee pot was a fancy keurig brand single cup coffee maker they would be better off just having the regular motel room coffee pots since you can only make about oz of hot water at a time for oatmeal or tea the door keys didnt always work and when they did they took about three tries to get them to work the window didnt have a safety stop on it and you could open it all the way openvery dangerous if you have small children we were on the forth floor i feel that the price was way too high for the low quality of the room i plan on coming back out to seattle within the next  months but i will not be staying there",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

"very uncomfortable hotel thats lost its way
my husband and i have just returned from a wedding anniversary weekend in new york city it was the first time that wed been on holiday without the children years so we were looking forward to partying late into the night and having long lazy days in the loft  thompsons equivalent to a penthouse suite  thompson seemed the perfect choice due to its location and the apparent luxury of the loft how wrong we were 
firstly i think its worth noting that the girls at the concierge were fantastic friendly and would go the extra mile and managed to get us into nearly all of the bars restaurants and club that we requested 
however everything else about the hotel was very below par
 the layout of the loft seemed to be designed for a business man that doesnt have many toiletries rather than a couple or a woman there was one small shelf in the bathroom only just enough space for moisturisers toothbrushes toothpaste and mouthwash we had to remove the complementary cotton wool cotton buds and drink glasses from the bathroom into the bedroom in order to make room for our toiletries this made the bedroom area very cluttered immediately 
 the bath was  the size of a normal bath obviously in a city where space is tight you would expect small baths in hotels but certainly not in the best room in the house 
 in the shower there were two small showerheads one of which was plastic
 also quite shockingly both the bath and shower had shower curtains rather than transparent doors i would always worry about the hygiene of having shower curtains in hotel rooms 
 after i had my first shower i obviously needed to dry my hair and straiten my hair but there were no power sockets next to the fulllength mirror i called reception and asked them to find a solution but the response that i received was that guests used the power sockets in the bathroom for the hairdryers and irons i was flabbergasted as you will hardly ever find power sockets in bathrooms in the uk because of the health and safety implications especially when you have to balance hot hair irons on a wet sink 
 i had the same problem when i needed to apply my makeup whenever ive stayed in hotel suites ive had a dressing table with a mirror but not at the  thompson there was a desk but alas no mirror during my previous conversation with reception about hairdryers i did ask them if they had a desk mirror that i could place on the desk so that i could apply my makeup in a normal fashion the response was negative apparently women apply their makeup under the false light of the bathroom 
 the bed was presented nicely but the mattress was about inches too small for the bed itself so our pillows ended up on the floor between the gap in the headboard and mattress covered in dust 
 attention to detail in our room was severely lacking one of the staircase lights was broken when we arrived and didnt get fixed for the duration of our stay eventhough we had informed the management 
 the room service food was terrible especially the breakfasts the burger and fries was so terrible that when we needed food in our room we ordered a delivery pizza  coincidentally we saw another guest taking a pizza back to his room 
 on our last day i asked for a pot of tea for our room but i wanted large mugs same as what they used for coffee i was told that this wasnt possible as all of the large mugs smelt of coffee and they couldnt get rid of the smell  i suggested they wash them properly 
 the bar was beyond noisy and quite cold we wanted a predinner cocktail at the bar but the dj was on early and the decibels were comparable to the nightclub that we were at later that evening 
 there was only one doorman at the door at anyone time so this was a problem if several guests needed cabs hailing at the same time in the end we would walk up the street and find one ourselves out of all the doormen we met we only really got good service from one of them 
 i had phoned the general manager several times during our stay and left a voicemail for him but i didnt receive a call back from him on our final day i was quite furious and asked to speak to the duty manager when i finally made contact with the duty manager he told me that the general manager doesnt work on weekends and he hadnt been working on the friday either i gave the duty manager our list of grievances he was very apologetic but he said that he didnt have the power to address any of them i told him that wed been given a guaranteed late checkout upon booking we were due to leave for the airport at pm but he said that he couldnt let us have the room after pm his solution to this was to give us the best available room in the hotel to leave our bags freshen up and relax in until we needed to leave for the airport we accepted his suggestion but we were left dumbfounded by the boxroom that hed given us it was extremely small dark and hugely depressing we stayed there for all of  minute and decided to walk the busy streets of nyc for   hours 
 when we checkedout they didnt give us a discount to compensate for very poor service and substandard best room in the house the duty manager said that the general manager would call us the next day one week on and we havent heard from him
i hope this will be helpful for anyone thinking of staying at  thompson i certainly wouldnt return and i wouldnt recommend it we hugely regret staying there",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

"please take this review into consideration before booking at the state plaza hotel
i created a tripadvisor account just to write this review of the state plaza hotel where i stayed this week to my great regret i cannot pretend that my experience would be representative of all stays at this hotel but it was so bad in enough areas that i think it warrants consideration by anyone who is trying to decide whether to book a room at this place
i will grant that the room was reasonably clean the bed was reasonably comfortable and the building is reasonably located it was everything else however that diminished any redeeming value that these qualities might have lent to the hotel
first i stayed at this hotel at the tail end of recordbreaking high temperatures in dc that were comparable to summer weather in the city in spite of this fact the hotel literally refused to turn on the air conditioning arguing that the hotel was equipped only with single pipe air controls until the temperatures were high enough  with degree highs that week i wonder how much hotter it has to get for the hotel to be satisfied  the management would leave the heat on and not turn on the air when i called the front desk to request that they turn on the air conditioning they simply told me to open the window and turn on a floor fan that the hotel provided 
i honestly do not understand how the hotel believes that it could in good conscience subject its guests to these kinds of conditions it is difficult to describe how miserable it was to lie in bed trying to will myself to fall asleep while sweating profusely in a muggy and overheated room it is also difficult to describe how uncomfortable it was to open the window when the only view out of the room was into the neighboring embassy and its residents even more difficult to describe is how i awoke at the crack of dawn completely startled by the deafening sound of the garbage truck picking up dumpsters in the alleyway outside before i realized the source of the commotion i mistakenly thought someone was hacking his way into my mediocre sauna of a room 
my stay would perhaps not have been as horrific if i had at least been able to take comfort in a nice shower in my room unfortunately the shower drain was not just slow  it was so clogged and backed up that literally within seconds of turning on the water the tub would begin filling up every three or four minutes i would have to turn off the water completely stand in the shower with the water off and wait about four minutes for the water to drain out so that i would not run the risk of spilling the water out of the tub into the rest of the bathroom 
my most significant complaint and the primary reason for my writing this review was the poor quality of service at the hotel perhaps the staff is more capable when asked to give directions to the newseum but i found them totally incompetent at fielding basic requests i would have to ask them at least three times to do something before it would actually be handled for example when i called about the air conditioning the front desk suggested that i use a fan i asked if they had a fan but they told me they were unsure and would have to call me back because it was not clear if they had a functional fan to give guests if they had notice that the weather would be hot as it had been for days and that the management refused to turn on the air conditioning why would the staff not adequately prepare to hand out fans to guests immediately especially since they suggested these as a remedy ultimately it took several calls to guest services and a couple of conversations at the front desk before i was even able to obtain a fan for the room 
by the middle of my first night sleeping in the room became torturous when i called the front desk to ask that the air conditioning be turned on i was assured by the night manager that it would be turned on the next day of course this promise turned out to be too good to be true  the night manager was just saying that so people would stop calling him to complain all the hotel did the next day was turn on the fan in the window unit which circulated lukewarm air around the room even this episode raises the question of why if this was a possibility the hotels management did not resort to this method however unsatisfactory sooner it appears from my conversation with the night manager who expressed disagreement with the overall managements decision to keep the air conditioning off that the state plaza hotels management prioritizes costcutting over the basic comforts and needs of its guests
i had to stay two nights at the hotel and although the first day and night made me lose most of my confidence in the staffs ability i maintained some hope that maybe they could fix the shower drain in my room so i could at least have a decent shower after working and walking around all day in the heat i informed the front desk shortly after  am that i would be gone for the day and that the tub drain was in dire need of repairs since i made this request only once the task obviously was not completed and on my second night i found myself once again taking a shower in standing water
i understand from previous reviews that other guests have managed to enjoy their stays i do think that is possible despite my experience but i would also say that although this review seems to cover only an extreme situation the indifference demonstrated by the state plaza hotels management exacerbated by the incompetence of its staff leads me to urge any potential guests to consider other options very seriously",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

i stayed here for a week in april for business on campus i was very pleasantly surprised i had prettylow expectations and was a little worried upon arrival to the slightly tired and worn lobby and hallways but the rooms are more modern than the outside dont be scared off by the outside 
the bed is surprisingly really comfy and the room was very dark and relatively quiet at night so slept very well all the good channels on the tv bathroom has aged but all very clean decent towels which are replaced daily if youd like 
perfect location right near bus terminal to downtown hollywood both met buses and santa monica big blue buses also the ucla campus bus stops right outside staff at reception  hours and were always happy to answer questions even show me the vending machine upstairs which i couldnt find upstairs on my own they even gave me a list of nearby restaurants which deliver to the hotel which was great when arriving back at the hotel after a long day and wanting to order a pizza
breakfast was simple but again much better thani expected bagels toast meats cheeses muffins  pastires  coffeeteajuice wifi is also unbeatable no password required  works well on phone and lap top including skype video streaming

customer service upon entering the hotel to check it i was casually greeted by the two staff at the front desk one was eating her lunch taking photos of it and sharing them on facebook via her cell phone with food still in her mouth she asked how she could help us he coworker remained reclined in his chair with his feet on the front desk as he too fiddled with his phone during the checkin process there was a problem that could only apparently be fixed with the two staff yelling at each other in front of us very professional ten points for youthful rage and intensity zero for customer service
elevator jeez lets try this with only one word descriptions smelly rickety old rundown smelly smellandfresh after someone sprinkled baking soda on the ground terrible i would have taken the stairs had they not been so narrow and had the guard rail not been unhinged and unsafe
room busted ceiling fan old wornout bed was the perfect nest for a crappy nights sleep 
bathroom skin friendly shower had two settings drip drip driiiiip and holytortoisecrapcandy i have no more skin left at least the water was warm
overall state of the hotel dilapidated the paint is chipped and the carpet is old musty and coming undone in the hallways the staff are unprofessional and rude the area isnt the best but then its san francisco where you always need your wits about you and where walking at night can be a bit sketchy for example there is a walgreens just down the street where hookers and pimps obstruct your way not only in but also out

staff they are extremely professional on my first trip i had a great natural small conversation with the person checking me in it definitely didnt feel forced from them the second time i checked in i was getting in around pm so the guy checked me in as quickly as possible the systems werent working properly but he mentioned that he had all of my info on file as a hilton member and that i could just go ahead to my room rather than wait for the system to boot up
experience i was celebrating my boyfriends birthday on my second trip on my reservation i noted this and requested an upgrade if available upgrades for hilton members are free when available to my surprise they not only upgraded me to a great room top floor end room balcony jet tub they also greeted us with a bottle of wine dont forget to get your cookie on arrival
car service from hotel i was a little confused here when i called in they said it would cost  to get picked up as a result i opted to taxi but when i asked to get a taxi to go back to the hotel they said they could provide the car service for  i guess it costs less getting dropped off than getting picked up 
rooms the hotel overall is not your modern hotel theres definitely a vintage vibe to it to some they may think its outdated to me i think its cute furniture is standard with a fluffy bed and sofa the room they upgraded me to had a jetspa like tub the room and bathroom areas clean as can be given its a little old in architecture
entertainment the tv is hard to navigate through the channels you want to watch but despite that theres a lot of channels to choose from internet is available and for elite members it is free just charge it to the room and it should be cleared on your bill 
others theres a bar available as well as a restaurant named juno as an elite member they offered me a voucher for  to use at juno i took advantage of this during my first stay and got a bagel with salmon cream cheese and capers with a side of grapes it was delicious they also have umbrellas in the room for you to use during your stay",5.0,3,-2.0,2.0

i was assured id be upgraded when i checked in however they couldnt as the manager wasnt there i emailed him and had no reply my room was a king on th floor very cramped sidewise even though it was their biggest king two people would struggle to move around each other
the water pressure is poor the tap and shower dribble very disappointing as its a lovely styled bathroom hairdryer barely dries you its pathetic the aircon is also poor very noisy and doesnt give off much cool air what annoyed me is that they advertise super fast blazing internet this doesnt exist just wifi thats only ok i enquired at reception and the guy didnt know what i was talking about also there is no wireless audio system via a bowers and wilkins system like they advertise i had a small cheap ipod dock i had one window that looked into someone elses room so i couldnt have the blind up so it felt dark  the tv channels are also poor no hbo or movies just a basic cable package breakfast is basically a holiday inn express style buffet good luck finding a table to sit i sat on some stairs in the room there is nowhere to put your luggage and no closet just wire racks with  hangers either size 
overall i was hugely disappointed and will not be going back i paid allot of money this is no way a boutique hotel it is a glorified holiday inn express with nicer fittings and fixtures start scratching under the surface a bit and youll see for yourself what i mean",1.0,2,1.0,1.0

the only two cons i could think of are the lack of a coffee maker in the room but it is free down in the lobby in the morning and the ridiculously small area to drive into when you first check in it is literally big enough to hold only  cars but the valets are always there to help get you in and out in a hurry beware as parking anywhere overnight in chicago is pricey and the palomar is getting  with in and out privileges",5.0,5,0.0,0.0

this hotel is a typical large busy conference hotel it is also a bit out of the way with no stores or shops close by or places to run out and get a bit to eat

"very good but expected more from this hotel
i booked a onebedroom suite for  nights at the setai fifth avenue i chose this hotel because it is branded as a five stars hotel because of the flexible checkin and checkout times and finally because of the good reviews on this website unfortunately even though there were positives during my stay at the setai it did not reach my expectations for many reasons
ill start with the negatives
first they pretend on their website that the hotel has flexible checkin and checkout times in the hotels guide inside my suite its also clearly written that theres no check in and checkout times at the setai and that guests can request a late checkout for their date of departure unfortunately this is not true i booked this hotel for this reason because i was landing in newyork in early afternoon and leaving in the evening and i didnt want to wait hours at the hotel bar to wait for check in well thats exactly what happened i arrived at the hotel just before hpm and they told me at the reception i had to wait until hpm for my suite to be ready no excuses no upgrades at h the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready that was a nice touch but i was expecting my room to be ready when i arrived same story for checking out i asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout they asked me what time and when i said hpm they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was hpm thats unacceptable from a hotel that clearly claims they have no checkin and checkout times
the other negative is that i requested at the time of booking a high floor because i always like to have nice views when i book hotels they gave me the th floor i could say it is a high floor but not in this case since their website says the hotels one bedroom suites are located between th and th floor 
the third negative is the service in the room for example there was a lack in maid service there were spots of dirt left after the daily maid service also coffees and milks for the espresso machine were not refilled so i had to call for a refill and it took more than half an hour to have someone come to my room even though they said someone was coming right now same thing for the laundry service the person at the phone said someone was already on her way to pick up my clothes but it took more than  minutes to have someone knock on my door this same person asked me when i needed my clothes back and when i said for the next morning before ham they replied no problems they will be in your room before  they gave me back my clothes at ham without warning me they would arrive late
these are some of the small details that alone are not that bad but put together they leave a poor impression it is unacceptable from a five star hotel who ask their clients more than night to stay in the type of suite i had
now the positives
first the inroom dining although expensive everything from the presentation to the quality of the meal was perfect
when i needed transportation to go downtown i asked if the chauffeured maserati was available and it was what an experience the driver i forgot his name knows how to ride this sport car he will get you to your destination in a very short time and dont be afraid he is a very good driver
also despite the erratic service i already mentioned above the staff is for the majority exceptionally friendly they will always smile say hello and when they remember they will greet you by your name 
concerning the accommodation the onebedroom suite i had was very nice it was nicely decorated and very spacious these suites are equipped with washerdryer fridge microwave oven etc it really feels like you are at home also the tv in the bathroom is a nice touch 
in conclusion i would have given this hotel  stars but since i cant give a half star i give the setai  stars because thats the number this hotel should have in reality a  stars hotel is in my opinion close to perfection unfortunately the setai fifth avenue failed in many departments as stated above it is still a very good hotel but it costs too much for what you get in return
for all these reasons i do not think i will come back at this hotel im ready to pay a lot a money for service but i expect to get what i pay for which was not the case at the setai for the same price next time ill try the trump international hotel or the mandarin oriental",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0

i was excited when i booked this hotel judging by the pictures it looked like we had booked a massive suite however when we arrived we found the bedroom to be so small there was hardly any room to walk around the bed and the separate living area was also short on space the decor also seemed dated and not worth the massive amount of money we spent to stay there
it literally is right in the heart of times square if crowds bother you do not stay here its quite a mission to try and get to the entrance of the hotel 
check in was speedy and the staff were pleasant informing us that we had arrived on gang initiation night and what areas to avoid the staff at the little cafebar are a different story we were given a  voucher each to use at the cafebar however they would only let one of us use the voucher saying that we could only use one per day this was no where on the terms and conditions on the voucher i asked for an extra strong latte so they made up one latte then a separate espresso and tried to charge me for both i asked for an apricot danish and they gave me plum  perhaps they dont have a firm grasp on the english language
we were also harassed into trying to attend a time share seminar despite telling staff several times we were not interested
of course staying in times square it does get quite noisy lot of sirens and shouting in the street we were also placed in the room directly next to the elevators but i didnt hear them so much at night over the sirens

also other bad things about this hotel it advertises the roof garden for the guests but actually it is continually rented out for private parties so forget that we nearly walked down the isle with a bridal party when we tried to go out into the garden
the plumbing i see that others have taken note is unreliable i couldnt fill a bathtub to take a bath at pm at night because the water from the faucet was such a tiny trickle

finally after i checked out i left my bags with the porter while i roamed around the city before my flight when i returned to collect my bag they couldnt find it despite the fact that i had the claim check they gave me it got so silly that they invited me into the checked bag area to see if i could find it were they going to just let me take any one i chose fortunately i found my bag and as i was walking out there was another woman coming in to look for her bag that they couldnt find clearly my experience wasnt isolated  star service i think not",3.0,1,-2.0,2.0

our stay at the marqueen hotel was depressing and it was kind of our fault  we had a wedding in seattle and were looking forward to some city time  some family members booked at the marriott  then a niece said she booked the marqueen as it was cheaper and had free parking  so everyone changed reservations 
if you arrive at this hotel by car be advised it is on a busy oneway street  there is valet parking only with two spots out front to leave your car  you are allowed to return to your car escorted by the valet
on arrival in the musty smelling lobby we were told by the very snippy desk clerk that the hotel did not offer free parking but we could self park three blocks away  she acted like we were trying to cheat her but it was our mistake and the web site says fee charged  then she says our room is on the second floor up the stairs  they have no elevator  not on the website  this was ok for us but in our group we have a heart patient and an arthritic  i mentioned this to the clerk  she took it to mean we were refusing the second floor and would put us on the first floor with our group  we  later found out everyone else was on the second floor
at this point i would have changed hotels were we alone  because everyone was there we stayed
the room was strange  it was dark with a very small bathroom with no bathroom fan odd little kitchen with a large fridge a microwave dishes but no cooking utensils poor tv a scary closet and a view of a muraled brick wall  feet away  the bed was ok but not good enough to make up for the rest  you could have clean towels if you left your towels on the floor but clean sheets were not an option

the bed was very comfortableprobably one of the most comfortable ive slept in at a hotel the employees were very nice and helpful checkin went quickly and we had no problems with our room my biggest complaint was that there were no towels at the pool i know that it was crowded on and off all day but i think there should have been someone who was responsible for making sure that the towel supply didnt get completely depleted i saw employees walk by outside of the enclosed pool area many times but apparently they had other jobs they were doing there was a fire pit by the outside pool area which was very nice we also used the indoor hot tub but it had a green tint to it so i had some concern about how clean it was

my daughter aged  and i stayed in this hotel for a week which included five nights during and after hurricane sandy the holiday was her th birthday present and i was hoping from the reviews that it would be a great hotel and the rooms would be as nice as they sounded as we would probably end up spending some time relaxing in our room at night after lots of sightseeing and shopping
 the hotel is in a really nice location mostly very helpful staff particularly reception and the room cleaning staff we had a king size room with kitchenette which should have been great
however what really let the hotel down was the response to the loss of power after the hurricane despite days of warnings on the news to stock up on batteries etc when the hotel lost power the only thing the staff had to offer was a glow stick per room ours didnt work there were some nightlights on offer later but these lit up a small part of the room and lasted about  hours so it still meant creeping around in the dark when i asked if more lights were available i was asked to hide the nightlight in my pocket as they had run out of even those
some guests went out and bought their own extension leads so they could use the sockets in the corridor but the hotel management didnt seem to consider buying any 
i expected the hotel to reduce the price to compensate for the lost facilities but when i checked out and asked what reduction would be made on the bill i was told they would check with management and the feedback was
youre lucky other hotels have had to shut and guests have had to move
youre already on a reduced price  not sure what this meant as had booked direct with the hotel

joie de vivre similar to kimpton hotels seems to specialize in older vintage hotels that most people would characterize as quaint or charming usually in my experience that means smaller properties and rooms that may not be uptodate technologically compared to modern hotels ie plumbing heatingcooling even room decor as long as you know that going in and prefer or like those kinds of properties you should enjoy staying here
the hotel is located a few blocks west of union square so it is close to the action for tourists and if you want to get to shopping the westfield mall is about a  minute walk south and dining although not that close to the north beach or mission districts where the action seems to be now the checkin desk was not as friendly or welcoming as i had expected especially since this was my first time staying here and i had booked a package and wanted to know whathow to redeem the extras i was never offered this information 
there is a small living room next to the checkin desk that is an all purpose room serving as lounge bar and dining room you can get a free drink of wine from pm i believe almost every day so that was a nice touch
the room i received was really smalldisappointing since it cost over night the bathroom was old but manageable and it was okay for the one night i stayed but not sure i could spread out if staying more days than that unfortunately the most annoyingdisappointing thing was that there was no air conditioning fan or other means of cooling off the room except for opening a window which backed out onto the noisy alley below i mistakenly thought that the room temperature dial control in the room also worked for cooling but unfortunately it was the heating and only made the room more unbearable during what was a hot day and night
the morning breakfast was a buffetnothing spectacular or that appealing about it and judging by the other  people there not popular i believe that you can get coffee for free at the bar as part of your stay because of the unbearable heat in my room i couldnt wait to get out of there of course when i checked out i was prepared to tell them my experience but didnt get the chance as the clerk couldnt seem bothered to do more than check me out and never once inquired how my stay was apparently they must have a cadre of regulars who frequent the hotel so they dont need my return business",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

just had a short weekend break in new york and stayed at this hotel we had a junior suite which occupyed a corner location this gave a fantastic panoramic view of the hudson along with some of the iconic landmarks in the city we overlooked ground zero which is a building site but also very poinient and serene at the same time the  water features are now in place in the original footprints of the twin towers and look amazing when light at night its hard to visulize the finished product at the moment but no doubt it will be spectacular you could just lay in bed a survey the skyline if you wished the room was nicely furnished and had a seprated area to work or relax if you wanted coffee facilities are available but for tea you have to ring room service for hot water
the bar area was often busy so we only had a cuppa on the last day for me charles the concierge was the outstanding staff member nothing was too much trouble for him always pleased to help someone even rang down to ask him the temperature outside and gave the information with good grace his knowledge of the city and its transport links were great as this hotel for all its views is at the bottom of manhatten we were able to make great use of the subway system which is on the corner and as wtc  world trade centre is the last stop you cant go wrong as we were unsure of how the day would turn out we just purchased single trips form the machine at  at time if you were staying longer then a a  day pass would be better
we went for christmas shopping and i have to recommend a trip to th avenue when dusk starts the lights come on and its truly magical however as we were there for the start of the holiday season we felt a significant increase in people every where from the saturday which made some of the stores unbearable and times square almost unwalkable
so the hotel is lovely but you are out on a limb so depending on what you want to do as to the location suiting you there was not much around on an evening with a cluster of bars and resturaunts about mins walk just ask charles",4.0,5,1.0,1.0
"needs some more work to be above average
sothis is a tough one hotel at check in was fast and efficient  we drove a long way in a snow storm go there and were able to upgrade our room to what the call their executive suite  which meant you had a flat screen tv and some updated room amenities we got into the room and compared to other places we stay in cities would say the room was adequate  tv was flat screen but analog no room refrigerator which is usually helpful because of some dietary needs when i travel for several days which meant i needed a good size ice bucket to keep certain things cold until morning the room had no way to open window and was very stuffy read below  the towels were not luxurious but functional enough the bathrooms were the tiniest i have been to in a long time the door just cleared the edge of the toilet in swinging open and closed  the ceiling was low  when i got into bathtub and stretched i hit the ceiling i am   oh yeah  and the phone next to the bed was not working   ok now onto day 
i head out from room on day  around  am  get back around  and room has still not been attended  ok fine  so i sit down at desk to do some work and i hear drip drip drip  and get up  go to bathroom area  nothing in sink then turn on light in showerbath area and i see the drip drip drip is coming straight out of the light fixture above the toilet good thing i left toilet seat open or i might have been wading in some of it so i immediately turn off the light as the light bowl was literally filled with water go out to phone and call the desk to report the water problem in the bathroom coming through the electrical fixture  so i wait and wait  and about  minutes later call and say did i mention the water was dropping through an active light fixtureyes yes  they paged the engineer she should be on her way   min i open the hall door and askthe housekeeper to page the engineer or someoneok now  minutes i call again  the desk says the engineer is on her way  a few more minutes  and finally a knock on the door  the engineer comes in looks and then mumbles something and runs out ok fine  so i sit there and wait some more  about  minutes later engineer reappears with assistant  they unscrew light bowl and dump it out  dripping seems less and then stops  so the room above had a leak from the roof big snow storm nite before and engineer tells me that i have option to move rooms  i guess so  
anyway  to shorten this up  they do arrange a similar room on same floor and now i have to repack all my bags and materials get the bell man up to help me move  let my husband know that room has changed and to call me before he returns from meeting  
 hours later  all set in new room   hours of my life i would not get back
later that night  new room was even stuffier and warm that night if that was possible
in the wee hours we decided to get up and check the actual wall unit  we opened it up licky for us and took out the filter and the air started flowing better  in the sun we looked at that filter and were totally grossed out  it was dirty and packed with dust and debris  we stuck our head out in the morning caught housekeeping on the floor  who put in a nice clean filter   wth anyone got a maintenance checklist at this hotel
plus side  
everyone was very professional eager to correct the mistakes and front desk offered us some options as comps  we chose some drinks at their bar reviewed separately
hotel is in great location as far as getting around center city and all it has to offer
so individual staff made up for lack of overall management of the hotel

good
 friendly and quick checkin this hotel appears to be a high volume hotel and the front desk staff gets you in and out quickly there has always been at least two people at the checkin desk when i have been there the checkin service is nothing memorable but nothing negative to speak of either
 the location is excellent if you need to access downtown area or convention center quickly
 running trails are adjacent to hotel property if running or biking is your thing then this hotel is a good pick for you the trail runs alongside the lake adjacent to the hotel and goes for at least three miles i only ran three miles and then turned around
 clean rooms ive never had an issue with a dirty room here all of the rooms ive stayed in have been clean and stocked properly
 full service hotel i rarely ever have the need for a full service hotel but every now and then its nice to order room service or have a beer at the bar
bad
 price the room prices are ridiculous at this hotel as well as others in the downtown area if you dont mind being a short drive from downtown there are much cheaper hotels to choose from in buda sunset valley pflugerville round rock or the airport do not stay here if youre looking for a cheaper rate
 parking parking can be a pain to figure out the first few times theres a parking garage but you have to take two different elevators to finally get to your room additionally the parking spots are very narrow on one occasion i had significant hood damage on my car from someone backing into it
 rooms are nothing special the rooms here are standard older hotel rooms and nothing to be excited about but they are clean some rooms have a nice view overlooking the lake but you could also get a room overlooking the aweful austin traffic on i
 the pool area is very small i took my wife and two kids here one time and we were ok until three other people showed up to swim it was too crowded after that
 tv is not hd im still surprised at this one why would i want to pay twice the price for a hotel room and not get hd television just saying
 internet is about as slow as it gets if you have a g data tether option on your phone dont even bother with the hotel internet connection my connection speed was x faster on my phone than the hotel connection its hard to believe that a place this expensive doesnt even have uptodate internet speeds one more thing whats up with changing the internet password the next day such a pain",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0

"not the  star experience i was expecting
my son and i arrived by car on thursday the th of july  for  nights we actually came up a day early looking forward to our time in nyc in the four days we were in manhattan the only rude discourteous experience we had was with the front desk staff at this hotel management no less the rest of the staff was apologetic and accommodating and tried to correct their errors but couldnt do so without the managements authority 
my hotel arrangements were made on my behalf through a rd party such as this site my room was paid for in advance per night supposedly a savings off the rack rate of per night for a  star in tribeca i will first say that the hotel is clean and neat and what i would expect for a   star accommodations otherwise it fell short on amenities and service especially service no concierge or club level service that i could see no refreshments nothing and i mean nothing complimentary to make you feel welcome i gave them my credit card at check in for incidentals only to be charged  for my stay although i had already prepaid i was also given a king room to share with my  yr old son and refused any other accommodations although i offered to pay the difference the manager on duty was snarky and proceeded to lecture me about going through third party vendors for my accommodations as they cant guarantee the room type for that price i reminded the manager i was only asking for two beds and i was wiling to pay the difference i was told there were no rooms with two beds not even a suite not even a sleeper sofa and that they were oversold and couldnt accommodate the people coming in she proceeded to make calls to another sheraton hotel at my proding to see if they had a room with two beds but i was have to pay the difference in price i was told after she started to go through the list of hotels i dismissed her effort as i reminded her there was a purpose to our trip and we couldnt be delayed any further there was no empathy for the position we had been put in in fact she acted as thought she was doing us a favor to let us stay there her behavior was the most hostile i have ever experienced from someone in the hospitality industry
to add insult to injury we ordered chocolate cake from room service on july th of our stay and became very ill we could hardly leave our x cell of a room when we did leave it took several phone calls and trips to the front desk to get the  cancelled out of their system although they claimed they had contacted my bank the day before to do so lie i spoke to my bank at the front desk and was instructed that all the hotel needed to do was cancel the charge out of their system which they had not done my bank would update the balance in  hours the money was not the point the point was unauthorized charges to my card its called fraud 
when we left on monday the th and my car was brought to me there was a large splat in the center of my hood that was rust in color it appeared something had dripped on my hood wherever they had parked my car there were scratches along the drivers side door as if someone had tried to get in the vehicle my back up camera no longer works and the manual hood latch is disabled 
i have tried on several occasions since monday to contact lowell bebecenter to no avail 
i have been told he is away from his desk i have been told a manager on duty will contact me 
well see but im not waiting to take action the only souls on that front desk who showed a pittance of kindness was andrea and giselle btw i am a starwood preferred guest but ive never seen it as an advantage so ive given up trying to use it i recommend staying away from the starwood brand go marriott or intercontinental if you want a real  star experience",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

the room itself is adequately sized not spacious but not cramped with an extremely comfortable bed and good lighting amenities include an iron and board keurig coffee maker with two coffee and two tea pods complimentary per day and free wifi the bathroom was nicely appointed and a decent size with lots of counter space for your stuff great water pressure in the shower and a good hairdryer on arrival we found two packaged brownies as a welcome and each evening the turndown service includes a couple chocolate squares and a card indicating the next days weather a nice touch 
the property doesnt have a lot of facilities other than a barrestaurant on the main floor we only had one breakfast there it was good and not overpriced for a city hotel  you can get the continental for  which includes fruit cereal yogurt pastries and hard boiled eggs or they also have other items to order off the menu they offer free coffee in the lobby in the morning and two flavors of iced tea in the afternoons there are also three computers available along the front of the lobby
service was friendly and helpful we got a great dinner recommendation one night we didnt ask a lot but they were great about helping with the questions we did have and they regularly offer some extra fun surprises for their guests such as having a food truck out front giving out free food at happy hour  the day we arrived they were doing madetoorder ice cream sandwiches from  to  yum on the other hand they lack a few of the basics one generally can count on in larger hotels  no postage stamps for sale at the front desk and it was hit or miss whether we could get change for a  bill

when we wnt to check in it took forever the line was really long and was not moving waited waited waited until we finally received our room room was a little shoddy  carpet was worn furniture old and drab i went to the bathroom and noticed that there was only one bathrobe and an empty hanger for the second with a tag that said if you take the robe on this hanger you will be charged  well i guess the occupants before me are getting charged  but why didnt housekeeping replace that robe this was the least of my problems
the bathroom shower was not clean  it actually reeked of dirt seems like they never scrubbed the tub or replaced the shower curtain and years of dirt layered themsleves in the form of a film all along the inside of the shower curtain was gross 
the flatscreen tv was on the wall to the far left but the bed didnt face that wall and the bracket didnt swivel out so guests cant watch tv from their bed which is ridiculous we needed to watch a movie while either sitting on the floor or on the one chair in the room which we moved so that at least one of us could sit normally while watching ridiculous
the clincher  the wedding was scheduled for pm we stayed for two nights and asked for a late check out at pm which i know theyve offered to other guests they said they could give me a check out at pm but if i want pm i need to pay the rate for an entire half days stay i couldnt believe it i asked for a manager and explained that im part of a wedding party that was getting married in the hotel itself and we wanted the room so we could shower and get dressed wed be out by pm which is when the wedding starts surely they can accomodate that request rather than nickel and dime us for a whole half day when all we need is just two extra hours nope no dice it didnt matter that the wedding there was generating thousands of dollars in revenue for the hotel they wanted the extra  bucks or whatever it was for a half day rate in order for me to have the room for the additional two hours 
so in sum i wont go back theres a ton of hotels in nyc this one was very expensive and simply didnt deliver waste of money",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0

first off let me say that we were actually their first overnight guests the hotel had just opened the day we checked in while the hotel decor and furnishings are new clean and very modern they do have some kinks to work out but have no doubt they will all of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly especially kristina our room was very nice and on the th floor they have only  rooms per floor there will be a roof top bar opening very soon we were taken up by a staff member and shown the area that will be the patio views are wonderful they have a small barlounge in the lobby but it was not open yet wish it would have been so we could have enjoyed a drink there in our room  of the tvs was not working and an employee came right up and fixed the problem we had a mini fridge in our room too but they have them all enclosed in a cabinent and were having problems with them all over heating and not working as in the case of ours the same employee came up and moved the mini fridge to a different part of the room and by morning it was working again however we had leftovers from dinner that we needed to keep cold so they put them in their main kitchen fridge overnight for us we had no hot water in our tub but we didnt even use it the shower was very nice with a rainfall shower head they have tvs in the bathroom mirrors but had not delivered the remotes to the rooms yet so we could not use it another thing that we didnt figure out was where the ice was i asked a housekeeper and she took my bucket and said she would be back in a few minutes it was very nice of her but we could not find where the ice machine was for ourselves they also had no written info in the room about the hotel or how to call down to the front desk etc im sure they just had not put them in the rooms yet overall our stay was nice just wish we would have arrived after they had been open for a few weeks so we could have enjoyed all the ivy will have to offer without all the kinks the only weird thing about the whole stay was when we called and booked they asked if we were coming down for anything special and i replied our anniversary upon checkout the girl asked if they brought anything to us for our anniversary and we told her no she left the counter and went to talk to another male employee and then returned to the desk and finished our checkout never mentioning anything again about our anniversrayit was very strangeso were we supposed to receive something and someone dropped the ball i should mention that housekeeping did deliver a small plate with  chocolate covered strawberry and  other small pieces of chocolate to our room but they were delivering them to all the rooms so i know that was not for our anniversary we most likely will try them again once they have been established for awhile",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0

"hairs in the towels and lackluster management excellent valetbag service
i really enjoyed what the personal staff did for my girlfriend and me during our stay however the management and administrativedesk staff caused more problems than they fixed and this ultimately forced me to rate the hotel as  stars instead of 
my stay at the westin st francis this past weekend was a mixture of good and bad the valet service and bellmen were fantastic we had an emergency and had to leave quickly and our car was ready as soon as we asked the person who checked us in on saturday afternoon was excellent and quickly gave us the best advice for getting to the airport at am  take a taxi
unfortunately several things contributed to make our stay less than pleasant my girlfriend and i were in town for a wedding and needed a hotel room for one extra night the person who picked up the phone could not tell me when the airport shuttle operated the lady who booked us the reservation also did not have this information 
second as it was a multiday wedding there was a lot of hectic running around that needed to be accomplished we only had a few hours to ourselves the entire weekend and we wanted to spend them relaxing together unfortunately the hotel was completely unable to expedite cleaning our room they couldnt even tell us when it would be ready by except that it should be ready by check in time of course it should but if im asking you two hours ahead of time if you could clean it in the next two hours the answer should be yes or you should give me a reason why you cant
finally once we did get into the room there were multiple hairs in the bathroom there were hairs in the bath tub and in the towels themselves this is simply unclean what really bothers me though is the way the hotel responded
i had to leave to fly an international flight very early in the morning my girlfriend finished checking out later that morning and when she told them that she wanted to file a complaint about the cleanliness of our room according to her the person handling check out did not treat her concerns seriously and did not seem like they were going to follow up
for  a night we deserve to get better service ultimately despite the excellent service the valet and bellmen provided i have to knock this rating down from  stars to  simply because of the way the hotel responded to an honest concern that attitude clearly demonstrates a lack of respect for the client and a lack of respect for our business",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0
"ok  but could be so much better
the variation in the standard of rooms at this hotel is enormous  some look really nice and some are barely ok this sadly means that the customers with the loudest voices will get preferential treatment and upgrades  if you like to avoid confrontation you will most likely have to put up with a shabby room
room  is definitely one of the poorer rooms  air conheating was madly noisy even when switched off and didnt work that well either decor was really tired with torn wallpaper scuffed paintwork and worn carpet bath did not drain properly meaning you take a shower standing in  inches of water on the plus side the room was quiet apart from the heating  no sounds from other rooms and traffic noise not a problem
this is a budget hotel and unless you get a really poor room as i did it does offer a very good deal for a nyc stay location and cleanliness were both excellent rooms were cleaned very efficiently every day however the service is very impersonal  even downright frosty at times check in desk staff are admittedly busy but could make an effort to be more friendly  it doesnt cost anything guys and in  days not a single doorman offered me so much as a smile never mind a hello apart from one very nice and efficient man who organised a car to the airport for me no staff member made any effort to offer me any more than the barest minimum of politeness

the clientele at nine zero is an eclectic mix for instance the complimentary wine reception was attended by a large family including young kids business people young hipsters and couples not sure who their target audience is but id not return unless it was just adults oddly enough their atmosphere is more welcoming of dogs than kids
the rooms were small but they fit a lot in including  queen beds a flat screen tv and work desk as a family traveling we appreciated the queen beds because the kids were as comfortable as we were we also appreciated the robes which made sharing one bathroom easier

we were very excited to stay at this hotel because of the great rating it got on trip advisor and great price now this place is haunts me in my dreams
note i waited a few days to write this review because i wanted to remain somewhat impartial in writing this due to the aweful experience we had at this hotel
 we checked in at midnight due to a late flight parking was horrible to say the least all the spots were taken which would be fine if we knew before we got stuck by the dumpster the parking area is very small and we drove to oneside looking for spots but there were none we wanted to turn around and look on the other side but we had no room to do so we had to slowly inch our way backwards up the small entrance to try park to the other side we drove down the other side and went around a corner and up a small hill to find out that all those spots were taken we understand it was late and tripadvisor warned us about finding spots but they didnt warn us thay you will get stuck
 we were up on a hill infront of a gate that is chained shut we stopped the car slanted infront of a dumpster tow zone because we couldnt move anywhere we couldnt reverse down the hill like before because there were so many cars we couldnt turn the car around because there was absolutely no room additionally we couldnt reverse down the hill because there was a tight corner and the cars were very close to the wall we were stuck 
 we went to the night auditor to ask what to do and he just stared at us with his mouth open no joke i thought maybe he didnt understand english very well which is understandable but that was not the case after i told him our story and showed him our stuck car on the security camera i asked if he had any ideas for us i asked it very nicely he responded that he had none and then he stared at me again i said i cant park infront of the dumpster or we will be towed and at that point in the night towing looked like the only way to get our car out he then didnt respond and went to go sit back down i then asked if the gates would ever open and he said no
 i kid you not this happened i swear it
he then stared at me again and didnt even seem concerned i then said thanks and walked away because it was no use to argue or anything after an hour and a half we miracuosly got the car out by backing it up around the corner at  mph it was the most difficult thing ever 
we then went to our hotel room and we realized we didnt get the sofa sleeper like we had requested so one of us just slept on the couch i understand that we just requested to get a sofa sleeper but we were disappointed because we doubled checked earlier that that we did get one in the end
 that night i researched different hotels and found one luckily for our week long trip in the morning we cancelled the rest of the stay and moved on the morning gentlemen was nice when we told him we were leaving he didnt ask why he were leaving so maybe he already knew why or just didnt care the breakfast was okay there was a small selection of dry food and a waffle maker i never really got a good look at the pool
 when walking back to my room i saw a two little cockroaches scurry about they were outside the room but it was still a little jarring
 the room was decent there was a flat screen tv good water pressure and temperature clean sheets iron closet space and wireless internet the wireless wasnt the best but at least it was free
 i am still really dissatified with the trip because no one cared one bit about service recovery
i know this may not be a big deal for most of you but the workers didnt have name tags or comment cards if you want to continually run a successful hotel you should always want to improve and be available 
would never stay here again or recommend be warned you might have big troubles here and the workers will not even care

when we arrived back in the evening we asked for our new room number and the receptionist looked at us in surprise nothing had been done about our room and our bags had not been moved luckily there was another room available it had just as noisy an air conditioner  and of a level that woke you up every time it kicked on the faucets in this room were also wobbly in the wall the sink faucet was also wobbly that when it moved water sprayed out from behind the wall and across the room

booked two nights as i was arriving around midnight on a flight from lax the first problem was that every other airport hotel had shuttles circling the terminal after  minutes and no sign of the hyatt bus i called the hotel and they sent it over when i got to the room my first impressions were of a very tired property that had not been renovated in many yearsmaybe some carpet and furniture replaced but the bathroom looked original and what you would expect of a low grade motel and not a major brand there was also a area of the room where a piece of furniture appeared to be missing i then attempted to order room service and was told that room service had closed eventually after complaining the manager said he might be arrange some chinese takeoutthen i went to look for the mini bar only to find there was none 
im a hyatt gold passport member and have stayed in many hyatts throughout the world so im aware of what to expect considering this hotel is located at a major international airport the absence of both  hr room service and a mini bar is totally unacceptable 
i accepted that i had made a serious mistake booking the hyatt harborside and was ready to check out immediately however as it was now am i decided to endure till morning with no dinner i checked out at am and moved to the mandarin oriental which is clearly one of the best hotels in boston

i used priceline to book this hotel the price was reasonable for san diego but not a steal the hotel has a nice decor and a fairly convenient location but some of the facilities especially the bathroom were rather old fashioned and not as comfortable as in newer hotels my main complain though is about the the service  it is completely inadequate for a hotel of this class it seems that nobody really care what is going on you cant say that the managers and the hotel personnel are unfriendly  they are not  but they simply dont care about you they seem to be preoccupied by their own problems often lively discussing them with each other while you are standing by 
on the night of my arrival i realized that the shower basin was clogged and called to let the desk know that there was a problem they promised to take care of that but the next day it only got worse the basin got overflown in the morning and the water seeped outside the bathroom i had to get out of the shower and call them again and was late for my appointment that morning when i mentioned it to the manager he simply listened expressionlessly to it and made no comments no apology was extended on the day of my departure they failed to wake me up i was too naive to have a back up alarm clock set up by pure luck i woke up just in time to catch the train to get to the airport otherwise i would have surely missed my flight the manager who did not even have the decency to apologize offered to take one service fee    off the  bill the hotel has a mandatory  a day fee that they dont advertize as i bought the room through priceline i only leaned about it when i was checking in as this fee was mandatory i felt that they should have included it in the room price in the first place that said the room was of a good size clean and quiet and the hotel restaurant was pretty decent  perhaps somewhat overpriced but this is expected so if you have no problems whatsoever  which probably happens more often than not you may be ok",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

i stayed at the liaison with my wife and son for  nights in a room with  queen beds it was extremely convenient to union station we arrived by train and an easy walk to the metro at union station capitol hill and the smithsonian museums at the east end of the mall 
however by the end of the week the small size of the room particularly the bathroom left us feeling claustrophobic in particular the shower and sink were all in the same room without an outlet to plug in appliances such as a hair dryer in fact we had to move items off the furniture to have room and then got charged for drinking the in room bottled water which was simply stored in the cabinet  the charge was immediately removed when we pointed it out also the perks  the tour kit special pillows and exercise kit  were not really worth the effort the ipod tour was unexceptional and the exercise kit needed a dvd player which the hotel had run out of finally the beds were elevated quite high which i have frequently seen on business trips but which was uncomfortable for family members
also there wasnt any lounge or lobby area for a quiet place to read or relax the lobby with wifi access is adjacent to the restaurant and bar which get quite loud the pool on the roof was not as bad and had a lifeguard
the staff tried to be helpful and generally succeeded the concierge michelle even reached out to us before we arrived in response to a question i had sent about a tour we drank a lot of the excellent punch by the front door these constructive suggestions did not detract from having a great dc vacation but from the hotels reputation and the praise from a work colleague who had attended a wedding there we had hoped for a better experience we avoided the restaurant because of its prices in favor of nearby subway sandwich shops and our splurge meals at the capitol and the smithsonian",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

my wife and i stayed here on the last night of our visit to austin the hotel was very easy to find right off the freeway i thought it was a nice touch having the front desk staff wear a traditional japanese style clothing instead of the typical hotel uniform the rooms look very nice and i loved the bathrooms very nice fixtures and the shower with dual shower heads was perfect the big glass window from the bath to the room was a cool touch this remodel had the right idea with the look and theme but in my opinion the overall finishing was lacking some quality on the little details i am overly critical though since i work for a different hotel company i woke up a little late and found the continental breakfast unattended and  depleted i was able to get some orange juice and cold cereal but found it tricky to get it up to my room for both my wife and i since they had no trays to carry the breakfast on the desk had no phone but the toilet did is this a japanese thing",5.0,3,-2.0,2.0

i have to give the  star based on housekeeping i would have to say i give the housekeeping manager a  star based on his promptness and response we came in early and lo and behold they had a room ready i was shocked because of it being  am well we put our stuff in the room and went out to rainy philadelphia later in the day we went to eat with my mom and dad and then we went to the bar when we got back called sole food they have a great chocolate martini my wife loved it ok so now it is really late so we go up to the room and crawl into bed unfortunately not turning on the lights 
so the bad we woke up and we had slept in dirty bed sheets it appears to have been a nosebleed on the duvet and shall we say that time of month for someone for under the duvet needless to say we were grossed out when we woke up the next morning it is really sad when you inspect your clothes because you are scared it might have been you and of course out clothes were fine of course the gross out factor is worse when it wasnt you
so the good the manager arvel came up to the room looked offered to comp the one night and asked if we wanted anything else we actually did not cant really fix something like that i would have probably comped both rooms and offered a future weekend stay or bumped our room up to a nicer room the last night 
super nice customer service navy won the game so our son got to stay overnight with us i asked for a roll away bed and once we got back there was one in the room
i do have to give kudos to arvel and customer service

"first and last time to stay in a westin
let me begin by saying i am a starwood loyalist i am a seasoned traveler i stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago and hoped the bad experience might soften before i wrote the review but whenever i think of that hotel i think about my lovely relaxing get away from new york as ruined by this experience i went the weekend after the superbowl so you would think westin property a few blocks from the stadium would have its act together also the fact that this is a huge convention hotel ok convention hotels are not always the swankiest but usually very service oriented this one gets zero circles for service
 first i had a rental car when i pulled up at about  pm there was no valetbellmandoorman who came out i waited awhile and even honked my horn it was a snowy night and i was nursing a broken ankle after about  minutes i had no choice but to lock up the care and hobble in they said they only had one bellman on duty and he was helping someone else one guy at the front desk also helping someone else i was given a room with a burned out light in the bathroom so i called downstairs they couldnt tell me when maintainence would come up so i asked if i could just change rooms since i hadnt even unzipped my suitcase so it took a while but they come up with a key for a new room and floor it was fine as i started unpacking i heard a lot of noise in the hallway i waited about  minutes and it seemed to grow more it was now midnight i opened the door and i saw kids sitting in the hallway and drinkingshow no signs of leaving i said how much longer are you going to be out there and they just looked at me i called downstairs and asked if they could intervene they said well a fraternity has booked the hotel so there is not much we can do i said ok do you have any floors without a fraternity party going on they said they would move me so i waited and waited i called down and they said the bellman was on his way he never came after about  minutes back downstairs and the poor front desk guy still alone helping others at this point i am distraught bad ankle tired from a long flight and hungry he put me in a room he said where the pilots and flight attendants stay the poor alone bellman tries to help me move he was very sweet but i said it seems only three people are working tonight you the front desk and the guy on the phone and he said pretty much i couldnt believe itthe hotel is huge and they were nearly booked as it was the weekend before valentines day i got to the room it was fine no view but it was quiet i unpacked and called room service nearly  am now wasted all this time getting to a decent quiet room they only had a few items to offernothing hot and really cheap wines well i could see i am not at the w i asked how long it would take and they said  minutes so it would be nearing  am it was near  outside so they sent me to the attached restaurant which was nice enoughand they were closing up but took pity on me and had some bar food which was hot which i carried up to my room very glamorous 
i then went to take a shower and the heavenly shower headsonly one worked so it was not so heavenly the bathroom was smaller than most in new york and the lighting was very dim the towels were super thin definitely not heavenly and there were only one bath towel then went to sleep in the socalled heavenly beds which felt just like any old hotel bed nothing special about the linens either the next morning i went to use the phone by the bed and it did not work had to get up and go over to the desk i called down to ask for a manager to share my experience and see if i could get these items fixed while i went out for the day they said they dont have a manager until  i said ok can i leave a message for him i was doubtful that they took the message i went to the front desk on my way out there is no concierge at this hotelagain waiting in line although there were now  people at the front desk i told my person a little bit of my story and she was very rude i left my number again with her for the manager to call me on my mobile so the entire day no one called me i got back to the room thinking there was a message and againnone the shower was not fixed nor was the phone the sheets were not changed even though i put the little card on the bed that said change the sheets when i left the hotel i will say there were a few more people at the bellvalet stand than at night but when i stop to ask them for the best directions to the location only about  miles it was if i had asked them how to get to memphis they totally could not give me directionsdidnt seem to know the streets at all very odd they asked if i wanted to talk to a manager and i just laughed and left using my google map on my cell phonedifficult to use as the roads were slick when i returned late at night i experienced the same problem with no bellmanvalet had to turn the car off and come in same thing at the front deskone lone guy well only one more night of this when i checked out i stopped by the front desk just to be sure they had my entire bill including valet which incidentally they did not as i was charged for that a few days later again a very cold staff at the reception desk this is not the indy i remembered i finally said are you interested in my westin experience at your hotel the woman seemed a little shocked she asked if i wanted to speak with a manager i said yes but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to during my stay not as i am checking out i left my cell phone number if they were interested in my experience i will tell all who read this review to beware of this hotel it really gave me a poor view of downtown indianapolis after all the hype as far as staying in a westinnever to all who may be forced to stay here just know this is a very old property with some renovation in public areas the rooms are clean enough but very dated bathroom is so dimly lit you need to put on your makeup in the bedroom so bring some extensionn cords in terms of my rating if there were an option for no circles that would no circles too many",1.0,2,1.0,1.0

i arrived at the property around  am and check in was a breeze at check in i was not asked to choose my gold amenity nor was i given my  metrocard or  coffee card once i was settled in my room i called the front desk to activate my inroom wifi as my gold amenity selection the woman on the phone kept repeatedly telling me that it would cost me  for  hours and that wifi was only offered as an amenity to platinum guests after going back and forth a few times she finally apologized and told me that wifi was indeed offered as a gold amenity im surprised that such a highvolume spg hotel would be so unsure about their elite amenity choices either way i told management about that little miscommunication and they made it right immediately i commend the attentiveness manager miguel ms promptness of taking care of me  that goes to show you that excellent customer service is a priority at the hotel
i also asked about the  metrocard and coffee card that was included in my rate it turns out that they did not have any available at the moment and then told me that theyd have to mail them to my home address that was a bit disappointing but im sure ill receive them or at least i hope i do
i was given a king room on the th floor and the room itself was wonderful comfortable and spacious for nyc the bed sure did live up to its heavenly claims in fact i think it has to be the single most comfortable hotel bed ive slept in to date the room was quiet no street noise whatsoever and the bathroom had a doubleheaded shower which provided amazing water pressure before heading out for the evening i kicked back and watched my inroom movie thats my boy and i sure was glad that the inroom movie was included in the rate my movie selection was priced at  i also enjoyed  cans of diet coke  each to apply my  minibar credit

my only one thing that was a little irritating was when i popped back to get something and asked the valet to please not take my car down just leave it at the front as i will be back in  minutes i came back down in  minutes and my car was gone and then on top of that they had misplaced the key in that short time and took another mins to bring it back not cool when you in a rush and specifically asked for it to stay in front
overall great hotel with friendly reception staff i would recommend it and will be back again you cannot stay at this hotel if you dont have a car though well im sure you can but you would need to be calling taxis as they are not exactly lined up outside and i cant imagine where you would walk to took me about mins drive going into west hollywood or beverly hills with no traffic traffic is a different story all together haha",5.0,3,-2.0,2.0

i have stayed at the quincy a number of times many of the other reviewers already covered key points good location large room climate control is very limited so there is a chance you will be too hot or too cold there is quite a bit of noise whether you stay in the front or back side of the hotel and some aspects of the hotel and rooms are dated
i will address a slightly different issue the last two times i stayed here i had problems with my reservation which i made on the quincy website the first time i showed up about  pm tired and ready to get some sleep when i tried to check in the woman told me they didnt have a reservation for me i pulled out a printout of my confirmation and handed it to the woman the story then changed to someone canceled my reservation i asked who did that and when she said a member of the staff had canceled my reservation there was no explanation as to why she then proceeded to tell me the hotel was sold out and there was nothing she could do she actually expected me to just take my luggage and leave when i refused to do so she finally agreed to call another hotel and try to find me a room she got me a room at the washington suites which is about  mile away the hotel did not offer to provide a cab but she was happy to tell me how to walk there
as a result of that experience i avoided the quincy for a while but recently i decided to give it another try i made my resrvation on the quincy website when i tried to check in around noon i was told they did not have a reservation for me i again pulled out a printed copy of my reservation and handed it to the woman she again said she did not see a reservation for me the woman then took my printed confirmation and disappeared in a back room for about  minutes when she came out she said they worked out the issue she said the hotel had two reservation systems but she only had access to one at the front desk someone in the back room was able to finally find it on their supposed other system it sounded like a lot of bull to me
they told me they did not have any rooms available at that time and said i should come back i was not leaving anything to chance i was attending a meeting close to the hotel at  pm i actually walked out of my meeting to go back to the hotel to check in just to make sure i got a room
one other tidbit of info the hotel haa a quasi frequent stayer club called the q club if you are a member which i am you are supposed to get breakfast and a discount on the room i have never gotten breakfast also if you make a reservation on the hotel website there are no instructions on how to get your q club discount the hotel will be happy to explain the process to you once you get there but then you are expected to remember it

as we rode the elevator he assured me that in his  months of employment he had never seen anything like this happen he explained that he had really tried to find me a room as close as possible to the original one distance wise i dont know why he thought that mattered i explained that for me the  important things were quiet and a good view we went up to the th floor and walked what seemed like a mile of corridor to reach my new room it was directly next to the ice machine i commented on it but the desk person laughed it off talking about how convenient it would be as he was leaving he asked if id be in the room for a while i said yes and he said he was going to be sending up something special for me in a little bit 
the view was a courtyard view which apparently meant a view of gravel and other hotel room windows the room was clean but as i settled in i heard the door on the other side of mine open and close as several young children came barrelling out at full volume they opened and closed the door several times then went out for the afternoon as i unpacked and settled in i realized i was hungry but i didnt order food since i had been told something special was going to be sent up after an hour or so i heard someone trying to open my door i thought it was room service or something but it was another child this time from across the hall who had mistaken my room for his periodically i would hear someone at my door go to answer it and find the same young boy being led into the correct room
at about pm i broke down and ordered soup and tea the room service was prompt polite and friendly i tipped them really well later in the evening at bout maybe  or  there was a knock at the door it was the room service with my something special  macaroons in berry and almond and a little shot glass sized layered custard dessert there was also an envelope which contained a card with a picture of the philadelphia convention center on the front inside was a handwritten apology from what i believe was the front desk and maybe the housekeeping staff but it was difficult to read the next morning when my room service breakfast arrived i was told it was free of charge which was a nice bonus 
i truly appreciated the gestures but in any other hotel i would have been upgraded without a second thought instead i was practically downgraded to a lower floor in a worse location also the king sized beds seemed small to me more like a queen i called down to ask if i had been mistakenly set up in a queen room i was somewhat haughtily informed that the four seasons does not have queen beds just double and kings without a tape measure i couldnt tell for sure but i know what a king size bed looks like and this didnt feel wide enough to me",3.0,1,-2.0,2.0

on the positive side the night checkin clerks were very nice and directed use to bar and grill nearby within walking distance the bellboys were courteous and helpful when we were leaving tuesday morning but the clerks were not friendly at all upon check out no thank you did you enjoy or stay or even a helloi would not recommend this hotel to anyone",3.0,2,-1.0,1.0
"outdated renaissance experience
outdated renaissance experience
there were three problems during our april stay in the lax renaissance hotel
our small room was overfilled with outdated mismatching furniture  it was difficult to navigate in this overstocked room
five days before i left home my credit card had been charged for the cost of the room for the entire length of my stay when i checked in i was asked for the credit card that i was going to use to pay for my room i was asked to prove that my credit card show my credit card statement had been previously charged for the entire room cost it seemed like the front desk had no record of my payment though my credit card had already been charged
parking not free breakfast not included  compare this to the holiday inn express a few blocks up the street where the rooms are the same price are uncluttered parking is free breakfast is included and the morning newspaper is delivered to your room door 
kudos to the holiday inn express and boo for the renaissance hotel where its sophisticated modern look of the lobby and the slick restaurant dont compensate for the careless room design and poor customer service",2.0,1,-1.0,1.0
"so so  expected much better from hi
well as always i got a deal from hotwire for this hotel at night as compared to the hotel rate of  a night we reached houston at around pm and had to wait for around mts to check in at the counter which was handled by one surely over worked staff the first room that we were given  had a burnt smell coming up as soon as we switched on the ac and i had to go down for a change of room which was given immediately however this meant having to repack and carry our bags again the other room looked old and dated and finished in a hurry the bathroom was super tiny looked like they were literally built for kids one of hte pillows had a massive stain  no way am forgiving the housekeeping staff for trying to keep this pillow below another one
the ac was out of the s and was badly fit and made a lot of noise  havent they heard of central ac there was supposed to be free wifi however an access code was required which was not provided during check in the card on the desk in the room said that i had to contact the front desk to get the code and the last thing i wanted to do was go back to frontdesk again 
pros
 close to hou
 close to nasa 
 free parking
 free wifi though i did not get a passcode
 hotel had a laundrette not sure if it was coin operated or gratis  never used it but was pleased to see one

"good location but
we enjoyed our stay at the hudson and found the hotel and the room pretty good albeit we had a delux double and it was still very small 
positives are the location easy to walk to most places and close to the park the staff was on the whole really nice and helpful with any requests 
couple of negatives are that you can hear every single sound of street noise even  storeys high i could here laughing shouting cars sirens and on top of this our air conditioning unit was so noising that whilst trying to sync from london to new york time this did not help and kept us awake for a lot of the night  it was a toss up between being awake and freezing or awake with noise but warm 
there is not mini bar and to be fair no amenities in the hotel at all other than the hotel bar and restaurant the food was good in the restaurant but an odd concept of selecting a dish from the pass  it was good but if you are screwed if you want to eat the same as you someone else in your party as only  of each dish at a time available

i loaded my luggage into my car took a shower curled my hair and dressed for the day no call returned yet i drove to the front desk free parking is a great plus at this hotel the night clerk said he did call me back and i didnt answer i said i had my phone next to me he said he called the room i never heard the phone and the trunk of my car was only  feet from the door he said the manager would be in after a  am i should call him okay its  am in la what do you do i found a mcdonalds and slept in my car
after am i called and was told the manager would be in after am my next availablity to call was later in the day i got a hold of the manager it was quite a confusing phone call we had a bit of a language barrier but i understood that the problem was addressed and i could return to my room meaning the bugs were extermenated i said i did not want to return he credited my charge account for the next two nights of my stay but said he would not refund the  for the first night since i left with out telling them and i did not let his employee to come to the room which was not correct he said he would talk to his employee and get back to me i said check you cameras i had not moved the cones in the parking lot or my car till after am and talked to the clerk before i drove away what should i have done i have never run into cockroaches before i did not want to bring them along for the rest of my trip 
at what price of a room rate should you expect cockroaches are exceptable  he told me i had quite a discount on my room and they are always sold out like that woule make me feel better about the bugs
i ended paying double for the next two nights for my room and day parking 
 the pool was clean i saw employees working outside restaining the furniture it was really better than expected from the reviews the room was small two double beds small frig and microwave minus cockroaches it may have been fine the neighborhood was shadier than i was comfortable walking around in

"urine and mildew and false advertising
from the first phone call the desk woman seemed nervous and unprepared which of course made me nervous too i booked my room only to get a call a few hours later that the room i booked that was advertised was not actually available as it was still under construction she apologized and said that although i would not normally be entitled to a refund they would of course refund me for this issue i guess they realized that when theyre not letting me stay there they cant actually charge me it was only when i pleaded with them to find me something else in the area  which they should have offered to do since they were false advertising  that the woman agreed to do so a couple of hours after that i received a phone call saying that suddenly a room was available wow magic huh
upon arrival i became even more worried the entrance was narrow and the place smelled musty the lobby carpet was old and dirty and you have to walk through a very narrow hallway to get to the front desk very poorly planned this is which made it almost impossible to get a couple of small bags through at one time next was the interaction with the front desk though i didnt catch her name the woman that checked me in was so nervous and apologetic at the same time it made me feel like she didnt know what she was talking about she was all over the place trying to do several things at once but not really keeping her attention on me the customer she sure did take a few calls though and mess around with papers on her desk while i waited patiently along the way she lost the key to my room somewhere underneath her messy papers finally she found it and told me where my room was on the first floor thank gd
upon entry to the room i knew that i would not be able to stay there it smelled like urine and mildew the first being disgusting and im allergic to the second since i knew id have to start the arduous search for another place to stay that night i attempted to sign on to the internet after all they do guarantee wifi however the wifi didnt work in the room i was staying in after going back yet once again to the front desk and the woman agreeing to reset the router the internet still didnt work it was at that point i explained that i had to leave urine and mildew smell and no internet ugh
the woman at the front desk then insisted she smell the room i was in before she would agree to issue any kind of refund once she got into the room she did indeed confirm that it smelled it was only then that she agreed to refund two of the three nights i had booked she couldnt refund the first night because that was against their policy i guess the smell of urine and mildew and the false promise of internet is not against their policy at that point i was so disgusted i just left

beware it does not have an inroom safe so no storing a laptop or other valuables also no honour bar so bring your own snacks there was an empty fridge to store and most strangely when i called down for room service they told me i didnt have the right menu that was frustrating and turned me off room service so somewhat disorganized in that dept
i booked the city view because for me it wasnt worth paying for a view of the river however what they dont tell you is that its worth paying for the river for another reason if you have the city view then you may back onto the alley where about  different garbage trucks roll through each night emptying dumpsters on the th floor its extremely loud if you dont like listening to garbage trucks at night  pay for the view

the service was excellent every one will have a different experience but ours was first rate from the doormen to the check in to the elevators and concierge everyone smiled and was helpful we had a breakfast included in our rate and when we slept in and missed breakfast they accommodated us immediately by telling us that they would add a  food credit so that we could order room service or have an early lunch in the hotel
we ate in both restaurants the tea room was great the food in both restaurants is now provided by the owner of nys le cirque and everything was top notch from the smoked salmon dishes to the cheese selections to the authentic pastas and sauces 
i went for a run in central park and also worked out in the gym it is small but there was no one there and had everything i needed there were complimentary smoothies fruits bottled water and newspapers

"blake hotel should reimburse california delegates for  a night dump
stayed  nights for the democratic convention good points bed was ok my shower was strong lobby ok complimentary newspapers
bad points could fill a book and my room wasnt as bad as many othersat least my shower worked and the carpet wasnt wet
rooms and services dark dingy ugly roomsit just had the feel of a place that needed every surface deepcleaned and updated out of the s phone never worked despite requests for servicethey asked if i didnt have a cell phone so much for wakeup calls no directory of servicesextensions there were no services elevators inadequate and unreliable and so beat up they looked like a slumlords dream one day one got stuck and when we got the door open we were afraid to ride another one so all walked down the stairs
 ice machines for  floors  space under our door so we heard every sound from the hall no coffee pots internet signal weak and sporadic no towel bars in bath only place to put on make up had a nauseatingly yellow florescent light and there was a big brown water spot on the ceiling i heard there were people who had wet carpet in their rooms so i guess i was lucky ancient hair dryers last day we got no maid service in interactions with staff they were always polite as was everyone in charlotte but you got the feeling they were embarrassed and couldnt promise anything would get better and despite having paid  per person for a  day breakfast package they slipped an extra breakfast  charge on the bill
restaurants one overpriced the other was cheaper but nasty essentially a circular bar with cheap folding tables set up around it menu items not available bartender told me the place was sold a month ago and new owner had set up the bar last weekend just for the convention all the employees were temps and it would close down the day after the convention that free bottle of cheap wine they gave us after there were so many complaints was just a joke
location isolated there is nothing around this place no restaurants drug stores nothing several blocks in the heat and humidity to go anywhere on foot so once youre there you are stuck with cabs or a miserable walk we passed lovely looking hotels with bustling restaurants and amenities in the vicinity but this definately isnt one of them

"it could be a much better hotel if the housekeeping staff did not try to get guests up every morning
i have stayed at this hotel dozens of times and each visit however good has been marred by what is clearly intentional conduct by house keeping to get us all up and out of our rooms by their schedules not ours i have stayed in every part of the hotel and on every floor it never fails that the management does not stop this is crazy i know that the housekeepers work hard and everywhere else i stay i always leave a gratuity on the bed at this hotel however i want to practically scream as the daily cacophony begins when housekeeping arrives on the floor i stay in hotels every week just about but this one is unique for this bad feature i have complained but truly the management does nothing to change it over the years so why bother anymore it is like the hallways were a mall or a private home where anything goes at any volume
the rooms are fine generally spacious and clean the location while certainly not downtown has a metro stop at the bottom of the driveway and that gets you anywhere the meeting space is good and older rooms are always being renovated and freshened up if yours seems old and tired ask to be moved they will do it
the restaurants are fine but even better dining is right outside on connecticut a
avenue and nearby streets there is underground parking and the neighborhood is very safe proximity to zoo and metro makes this a good place for families
the walls are a little thin and rooms with doors between them are a bit noisier than they should be but this average rating i have given would be much higher if only someone trained housekeeping that guests want to wake up on their own schedules not those of the cleaning crew it really is quite amazing and the worst on a routine not isolated basis of any hotel at which i stay shameful lapse of management or maybe they want everyone up and in the hotel restaurants",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

the room we finally received was small but at least two people could move in it without one person having to sit on the bed and my husband could get inout of the bed with his cast the hotel needs some repairthe ceiling plaster was coming down in our bathroom and the walls are really really thin during our stay the police arrived at am to escort some young ladies from a guest room near us that were hysterically crying again not what youd expect from a  star
the beds were comfortable free internet if you sign up for the loyalty program and the location is fantastic right on the freedom trail
i wouldnt use caution if using priceline to book a hotel in boston as it appears this one is awarded frequently probably the only way they can fill the tiny tiny rooms not all rooms are small though if youre willing to pay the full price you could get a regular sized room but its not worth the gamble and there are lots of other hotels in the area that are simply fabulous we wont stay here again",1.0,1,0.0,0.0

the problem began when i checked in around pm i understood the woman at the front desk to say that the room reserved for me had no working tv or phone but that i could upgrade to a nicer model room at no extra charge so i agreed because i did want a tv and phone when i looked at the room it seemed fine i was in a rush because i had to leave to be on time for a dinner reservation
when i returned around pm i turned on the tv and realized it didnt work i checked the phonedead apparently i misunderstood her offer she thought i would be willing to give up the tv and phone to have a king bed instead of a queen even though i was by myself then i figured out that i was offered an upgrade to a room with no amenities whatsoever as it turned out these are the other amenities that were missing
 no ice bucket
 no cups or glasses
 no hangers in closet to hang up my clothes
 drawers were already filled electrical stuff and plumbing parts
 no kleenex
 no waste baskets
 less than a half roll of toilet paper and no extras
 no note paper pen or printed info about the hotel or surrounding area not even a phone number for the front desk

we stayed here for  nights after previously staying in downtown la the hotel entrance area is lovely although small the staff on reception werent the most friendly or welcoming they looked a bit miserable to be honest we found everything we needed in our room which had a lovely view of the hills the room was comfortable the bathroom was stylish and there were lovely bath robes the bed was perfect and we slept very well despite there being an earthquake one night the cleaning staff did an impeccable job
the rooftop area is lovely  the pool is small but nice i suppose its a criticism but we felt like it was quite intimidating to use the pool as there are restaurant tables all around it and we felt like everyone was watching us take a dip while they ate their lunch its just a tiny bit too crowded and you dont feel like you can sunbathe and chill out much 
we had bar service and ate at the rooftop restaurant in the day and evening the bar staff in the day are fantastic and the food was incredible the grilled cheese sandwich was amazing and i recommend the wilshire salad best salad i have ever had the evening staff were okay  our waiter was a bit obnoxious he was quite rude actually and it was quite obvious he only cared about trying to get a good tip he failed to impress the evening atmosphere wasnt really my scene lots of young people in tarty dresses getting drunk and being rowdy which shocked me i also thought the manager should have taken control but nothing was done despite the fact we had people backing up to our table and others trying to throw each other in the pool whilst we were trying to enjoy a nice evening meal

i realise this is new york city and you have to expect some noise but this was a jokemy travel partner and i stayed mon oct  to wed oct  i was coming in from las vegas nv he was coming in from toronto i told the hotel to add him to the booking just in case he turned up first which was done with no problems
on the day i arrived i got into jfk and grabbed my bags and took a cab after pulling up at the hotel the bellhop literally ran out and had grabbed my bags and ran into the hotel by the time i had paid the driver 
the guy at the desk was very friendly and issued me a keycard and then panicked because he had checked in my partner and thought he shouldnt have i assured him all was fine and that my partner was on booking 
i made my way up to room  on the th floor and first impression of room was that it was your typical ny size i liked the design and the bathroom had a real ultra modern look as well 
bathroom had wall mounted tolietry dispensers and everything we needed so we went downstairs and had a drink at gastro bar nice bar with a good range of drinks and nice atmosphere the hotel is located in the garment district between th and th on w th a  to  min walk into times square and i tend to agree with some people in that it almost seemed a little deserted at night with empty stores around but with the police station next door 
after dinner we headed back to the hotel and once we were ready to go to bed the problems began after watching a little television decent tv with good selection of channels we got into bed and turned off the lightsabout  mins later we hear a loud bang and then our neighbours enter their room they were so loud we thought they were in our room about an hour later they finally settled down and we went to sleep the next day i was in the shower and for anyone who has an iphone i could hear someone in the next room typing out a text message and as you know iphones really arent that loud 
we decided just to stick it out since we were only there for  nights the second night we didnt hear as much noise and we were conscience as we realised everybody could hear us too

i have to say its an interesting motel layout two separate buildings and some warehouse type building by and between it with fencing and barbed wire parking lot was gated to go out to the street to get to downtown but they open it up in the later afternoon which makes for a shorter walk to beale people at the hotel were great and friendly and helpful i see that people may mention the neighborhood but its really fine and is across the street for the baseball stadium there and just a few minute walk to beale which is what we wanted free parking to drive to other parts of memphis pet friendly although no great green areas for pottying the dog but made due fine with our border collie

poor isolation is such a waste of energy but at hyatt theyre going green anyway  they dont clean the towels unless necessary 
also they dont take em away either so you can leave a dirty towel on the ground well it stays on the ground

second day  nothing and parked our car in the street 
well hyatt charged us a  selfpark night they never gave us the ticket that comes along with selfpark and even tho weve complained about it theyve never removed the charge nor gave us the ticket by the way 
so pathethic it was almost getting funny
the next days we returned to the valet service this time they immediately charged the expected  mistakes only happen in a certain way at hyatt
one day weve left the privacy tag on our door when we left our room at  am we took it away when we returned at pm we found a small paper under our door it said  due to your request for privacy the room hasnt been made

what pulls it down to poor however was the state of my groundfloor room now i didnt have any pretensions of expecting the hilton or hyatt i was anticipating as many of the reviews pointed out basic and clean basic and clean is fine 
but grimy and dank and dark thats not ok
the carpet was filthy i like to walk around barefoot but my feet and the shower as a result were black on the soles from walking on the carpet was this a smoking room i wondered im usually very sensitive to the smell of tobacco smoke and did not detect it so i have no idea why the floor was so dirty other than insufficient cleaning and that raises the issue of insufficient cleaning elsewhere too  what a gross thought
the room was dank it smelled damp the ac had a distinct odor that smelt like burning dust the lighting was insufficient even with all the lights on in my room it was so dark in one half of the very tiny room that a pair of black shoes placed on the floor were invisible 
the dispenser soapshampoo in the bathroom were just nasty poor quality awful smell i went out and bought a cake of soap to overcome this and would recommend that those who wish to stay at this hotel do likewise 
the noise from the outside roadway was very loud and did interfere with sleep i was surprised at this because noise is not usually an issue for me i generally sleep well the fact that it was an issue on this trip either speaks to the unusually loud volume of the traffic  and noisy people talking loudly outside my door  or that i was just plain uncomfortable in the room to begin with
the free breakfast was reasonable for the inclusive price as others have pointed out it consists of coffee not bad but not good bagels fruit spreads and microwaveable dunkin donut breakfast sandwiches  if one can stomach the latter i cant 
i deliberated over marking this review as average i wanted to mark it as very good or even excellent because of the outstanding service but overall the state of the room was so disappointing and so awful that i just cant",2.0,2,0.0,0.0

"ideal location but showing its age
the good this hotel is fine if you are looking for a mag mile center location and plan on being out most of the time with its location next to many restaurants and shops the best feature of this hotel has to be its address starbucks in the lobby is always a welcomed sight for me floor to ceiling windows in the room with nice view i was on the th floor
the ok rooms are just ok nothing special typical older marriott room clean but aged its a downtown hotel so not massive in size but much larger than i thought it would be
the bad the valet workers were all very friendly every time but upon my early morning check out at am they actually brought me the wrong car i had a silver rental car and they pulled up in a red chevy  not happy as this error was making me late and not happy as it could have been someone else in my situation driving off in my car",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

the allerton is a nicesized hotel  not too big or small that has lots of historic touches and fairly modern rooms my room was quite large by chicago standards with a separate sitting room and generously proportioned bathroom the location is excellent  right at the corner where the apple store is on michigan avenue there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance the staff was very polite i cannot comment about value as i stayed on business at a vendors corporate rate if the rack rate is anything like the corporate rate the allerton would be deemed an excellant bargain only downside was a large dead cockroach in the bathroom at least it was not alive despite the roach i highly recommend this hotel",5.0,5,0.0,0.0

i stayed here for a quick night and yeh i must admit the low rate was the reason this is a nice location south just off of i which should have been a clue my room faced the highway and the windows offer no sound barrier to the noise right outside the window another noise issue are the room walls you can actually hear people talking in the other rooms

there are several other hotels of a higher brand just next door
rooms not bad if you recall your college dorm days
brings your own disinfectant spray and use it like you mean it
turn the air all the way up its helps drown out the road noise youll still hear the larger trucks
if you can avoid the west side facing i east side rooms you may have better luck with the road noise if you have them bring those ear plugs youll be glad you did

"very disappointing road noise is severe ridiculous restriction on tv volume seems like a bad joke
we booked this hotel on priceline for a really cheap rate so i wasnt expecting much i suppose coming away from the four points sheraton in san antonio for the same price and same star rating probably ruined it before it even had a chance though now that was a great experience that set the bar high anywaywe switched rooms a total of three times at the crowne plaza over a four night stay the only reason we didnt leave immediately was because of the priceline return policy after the third room we decided to put up with the problemssomething you should never have to do with a  star hotel in my opinion
we checked in fairly early on the st day but the front desk staff said our room was ready so we made our way upstairs to our susprise the room was not ready and there was still a maid cleaning the room we politely waited outside for about  minutes before deciding to say something to her she was very nice and was shocked that we had been sent to the room since it was not ready she then said something about the air conditioningheating unit not working when she turned it on it made a ridiculously loud whining noise that was obviously wrong she said their handy man would come and look at it we said ok dropped off our bags and left to get some lunch when we came back the ac was going full bore the room was freezing but the fan sounded fine i quickly changed it over to heat setting and the sound immediately started back up
side note for a moment all three rooms had a wall acheating unit with controls on both the unit and a wall thermostat the entire time i was there i never figured out how to use them together this could be user error but i doubt it i would shut one off and let the other try to work on its own but they would never work without some weird balancing act between the two very frustrating
i walked down to the front desk to ask about changing rooms the staff was fairly friendly about it but said there were no more rooms with a king bed i was traveling with my wife but we are fairly small so i said a double would be fine i also took the opportunity to ask about another point of frustration that bothered us the entire time the volume on the tvs can never be lowered below a level of  this is not a huge considering the amount of road noise at seemingly all hours of the day or when the acheat is actually working but it was generally right about the comfort level for us i was shocked when they told us there was no way to get it lower it apparently had something to do with the new hdtvs and their stupid hotel menu service for ordering movies and other crap some channels were unbearable also as they seemed to just be louder naturally i told them i wouldnt get that stuff anyway and they said they would have their head engineer come take a look at it he an assistant manager no less said something about removing the software lock and letting us use a master remote that never happened
as we settled in to room  i made the startlingly discovery that our minirefrigerator was missing from the room had it walked away because it hated the hotel as much as i was beginning to we had to get to a rehearsal dinner for a wedding so we decided to say something on our way out the notsofriendly woman at the front desk told me it was located under the tv in the cabinet i assured her i knew where it was meant to be but there wasnt one there she just stared back at me in disbelief the previously mentioned assistant manager appeared and said they would have one sent up and installed quickly to my great frustration the poor little fridge was still missing when we returned almost  hours later that night i immediately called the front desk to ask about it they said they would check and call back i waited  minutes and called back the person asked you still havent gotten one which of course never calms someone down she then put me on hold to check again and the line was lost i called back immediately and someone else picked up they said their assistant manager would be back soon and only he could help another  minutes later at  pm the asst manager calls and said they would send one within the next  minswhich actually proved to be truefinally we tried to sleep but it sounded like world war  outside with police or fire sirens all night practically on the hour i wish i was joking
the nd night was pretty much the same but we were so tired from helping with the wedding all day that we slept better on the fourth day i asked about moving to a different room and was told to check back around noon fair enough we ran out to run some errands and were happy to find we were being moved to another roomluckily it had a fridge ready to go i did however immediately noticed the road noise was louder though i walked over the window and found that the noise was actually coming from the acheater unit these are wall units installed in a box within the wall there was roughly a  space around the top of this unit that let air and noise from the outside directly into our room this was the rd room so i decided to attempt to fix myself i shoved a towel into the crackliterallyand then layered a few more on top of it this helpedbarely we made the decision to just turn the fan on nonstop and deal with being too cold than deal with the road noise at full level plus the ridiculously loud tv would drown some of it out 
while i was fixing the ac unit i also noticed the fan inside was horribly dirty it looked like it had never been clean i decided to not tell my wife that little piece of info or we would have been forced to move yet again i would recommend steering clear of this hotel the road noise is aweful sure the staff if pretty nice usually but i would rather have a quite dark room for sleeping any day and that does not appear possible at this location you have been warned",2.0,2,0.0,0.0
"mixed reviews for this hotel
we surprised our girls ages    for thanksgiving with a trip to nyc after much debate we went with le parker meridien mainly because of the location  the fact that any negative response someone posted was quickly answered by lisa in guest relations not every hotel is going to be perfect  that goes a long way in my book 
positives
close to everythingquick  min walk to central park
quick  min walk to times squarethe plazarockefeller centerbroadway etc we walked almost everywhere with my girls
guest relations sent up cookies the first night welcoming my girls to nyc for their first trip big thumbs up from the girls
hotel was clean not overly crowded although it was close to sold out staff  front desk was friendlyetc
kids loved cartoons in elevator
the pool upstairs was great the view was one of the best in the city you have to go to the outside area  up the stairs to really take it all in the guy  the pool was super nice 
yes its  per day per family however my kids really enjoyed it  it gave us a nice break from the hustle bustle of the day
negatives
conciergesince we were traveling during a holiday i expected a little bit more from the concierge desk they did not know a lot about anything except what was right around the hotel 
this to me is the biggest draw back of the hotel not the most friendly group of women i have dealt with on my travels i called weeks in advance for help with thanksgiving dinner reservations  they seemed a little put off that i was calling i even asked for help when we arrived  it was very apparent that a local restuarant had dropped off their menu to sell to the guests that being said there was brown haired curly guy that was very helpful he sent us to brooklyn diner diner is too informal of a word for this place for dinner i am pretty particular  i have to say it was wonderful super nice staff  excellent food the hotel needs to step up their game with concierge especially in a place like nyc they did not go out of the their way to help you with anything very disappointing
house keepingagain not the best the room was clean however the first night a bag of lotion shampoo etc was just dropped off on our bednot even sure why it was there i used one of the bathrobes  never saw it again they do not look to see what is in the sheets before sending off to be laundered they actually took my daughters blankie with the sheets as you can imagine the sheer panic when my  year old realized it was gone we did end up finding it thank goodness with the help of some very helpful front desk staff a very big shout out to them we also realized this morning that another item my little ones panda pillow pet was sent out with the wash as well too late at this pointdo not leave anything in the bedit will be lost forever
side notes
the doorless shower drains all over the floor the hotel really needs to look into fixing it nice size thoughwe had the jr suite  it fit our family of  just perfect
the hamburger place was fine not the best i have ever had but certainly good we had a better burger  sarahbeths down the street 
coffeebar was great super nice people
do not take bike taxitotal rip off as they do not tell you the price is per person in addition to per block
the hotel does charge for everything if you want to have your own items in the room you have to rent a seperate mini fridge which i found to be funny we did not do it the window does open a little bit in each of the rooms which was nice because we could not get the temp to regulate at night there is not a coffee pot in the room which surprised me a little but there is a starbucks on every corner literally 
the rooms are pretty quiet when the windows are closed we brought a sound machine just in case  did not have to use it 
overall it was a fine stay i would not rate it as a luxury stay but fine all the way around would i stay there again yes  would i recommend it to others yes mainly because of the location",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0
"no heat 
we booked the four points in chelsea because it was convenient to where my brother was hosting his th birthday party we werent expecting spectacular  it was modestly priced and we would have been happy with a modest room which is exactly what we got no bath mat plastic cups but not horrible just eh
there the story would end if it werent for the major failure  no heat in the room the hotel was booked solid it was late etc etc etc they did give us a space heater  but it was one of the coldest nights of the year in new york the thermostat said it was  degrees in the room on the whole this looked like a moderate ok place  but the lack of heat made this one of the worst experiences weve had lately",1.0,2,1.0,1.0
"great location value
ive stayed here a number of times and theres no better value for a downtown chicago hotel i dont think this is your spot for a romantic getaway but if youre traveling on business or on a budget this puts you in the middle of the loop for a reasonable rate the location is tough to beat as youre right on the river and within walking distance of both millennium parkgrant park and the mag mile this would be a perfect spot for lollapalooza attendees
the staff is absolutely over the top in their efforts to be accommodating and welcoming other than the location its the hotels greatest asset 
the rooms have a full kitchen which again for a budget traveler is a huge benefit but less of a value if youre vacationing and plan to eat out a lot the room layouts are unusual in some cases but roomy and comfortable the hotel is probably at the point where it needs a facelift and in some areas the wrinkles are starting to show always clean just well used the furniture is clean and in good condition 
they have a standard free breakfast every morning which again for a dollarconscious traveler is a huge plus they have a small business area though its best for simply printing off boarding passes theres free wifi thats acceptably fast 
so clean comfortable and convenient just not sexy in any way however if youre willing to pay for the upgrade the toplevel suites have open air balconies that are awesome",4.0,4,0.0,0.0

this hotel stylewise seems like its from the s and seems as if it is in the middle of trying to modernize and upgrade it has a bit of an identity crisis even where they have apparenly purchased new furnishings and decor it looks like they tried to match them to the old decor so it still feels old and a little austere the dressers desk and side table in my room look like hospital or dorm room furniture same with the new fixtures in the bathroom which are paired with old tile and tub the carpet seems new and soft i think the bed is new but looks oldish an interior door and the tub faucet has old rust on it but most of the fixtures appear to be new the carpet in the main area seems not clean though i think it probably is clean it just doesnt look like it decent towels the bathroom is very clean as is the room a room air conditioning unit works well makes a little noise but i kind of like that to drown out any other noises the easy chair in the room is faded and stained and kind of covered with industrial plasticy upholstory instead of regular cloth the desk chair seems brand new i think the bedspread is new but the style is like from the s i guess to match everything else the wallpaper in the halls is that kind of plasticy wallpaper youd find in a hospital or older apartment building the front desk staff was very nice signed me up for the rewards program pointed me to my room and the fitness center pointed out the restaurant and gift shop and gave me the wifi password without me having to ask about any of it at the airport i just walked over to the taxi area and saw the supershuttle and they have a negotiated  price to come here which i understand may be about half what a taxi charges i dont know what other hotels are around here to compare it to but i prefer a comfort inn suites or hampton inn suitestype hotel which is more modern and cushy if you were to book a guest or family member here you wouldnt exactly be impressing them with style or luxury however there is certainly nothing wrong with this hotel the folks are nice the price is good the rooms are clean the outdoor pool area is nice they have a fitness center and free wifi all in all i have no reason not to recommend this hotel as long as you arent too put off by the institutional feel of it",3.0,3,0.0,0.0

"mostly fine kimpton why such weird tiny bathrooms
im currently staying at the vintage park ive had many stays at other kimpton properties in comparison this one is fine but not distinctive i did appreciate that my room was available when i arrived around noon i had notified them of my early arrival when i made the reservation but certainly wasnt counting on it 
for the most part my room is fine one pro one can open the windows which is a rarity and something i really appreciate 
however there are  notable cons 
 i have appreciated that kimpton hotels typically dont charge utterly extortionate prices for items in their minibars ie the prices might be double the retail cost of the items rather than x the retail cost however minibar prices at this hotel are definitely on the higher end 
 i paid extra for a corner king deluxe room which should be the nicest aside from the much more expensive suite at the hotel why is the bathroom so ridiculously smallso much so that its not as functional as it ought to be this is something ive noticed at a number of kimpton hotels did i just get unlucky and get the premier room with the awful bathroom i hope not since im a frequent kimpton customer perhaps someone who works for the hotel will commentshould this happen again in the future should i request a different room or are they all equally badly laid out if theyre all different why do i seem to so often pull the short straw and get a less than desirable room when i am a frequent business traveler who stays at kimptons at least xmonth on average",4.0,3,-1.0,1.0

"w chicago lakeshore star fraud
let me start this review by stating that i am not the target demographic that aspires to this hip hotel brand i lucked out or so i thought purchasing a room for myself for a weekend in chicago i did not choose the wlakeshore i purchased it blind through hotwire and was enticed after learning it was a star hotel and i had received an amazing deal after staying here for the last  nights i cannot recommend this hotel and in fact have stayed at far better  and  star hotels
my biggest gripe with the room was the connecting doors between rooms i was awoken at  am by incredibly ignorant drunk and loud morons from the room next door after banging on the adjoining door and asking them to keep it down i finally called security while i understand that being situated near unruly hotel guests is unfortunate luck i am surprised that a star hotel would have this feature in their guest rooms the rooms design also leaves much to be desired as the bathroom sliding door and windows do not retain heat well from the shower a definite plus for colder chicago ams when you step out of the shower additionally the shades covering the windows do not do a very good job of blocking out the light so an early wakeup was my bonus for staying in such a chic botique hotel room 
two other things really made me feel that the wlakeshore was nickel and diming their customers the first was being given a complimentary plastic water bottle on arrival into the room i also saw two other bottles of water in the room as well but when i read the tags on the other bottles i realized that these were  each i imagine some w marketing genius decided that this was a great way to increase value at the hotel i call that deceptive and gouging the other nickleanddime move is the hotel charging fees for wifi use whats the matter starwood the room rate isnt enough for you ive stayed at  and star hotels that gave me free wifi plus i even got a chocolate chip cookiefor free

us air put us up when our pm flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues after waiting on our bag and then the shuttle we didnt get to the hotel till almost am with a flight leaving at am the hotel was super creepy we were the only people there other then the desk clerk walking around this extremely dated hotel with a giant lobbydining area that has two fountains and a gazebo it was honestly a mix between the mall in the original dawn of the dead and the hotel in the shining then we get to the second floor and the elevator doors open directly in front of an abandoned room that is under construction door wide open lights out debris every where we turned the corner to see this extremely long hallway that just feels creepy finally getting into the room didnt help either our window looked into the creepy lobby right at the gazebo the airheat didnt work well either you were burning up or freezing the shower didnt drain there was hair in the sheets which were so worn out they were transparent in spots it looked like there was mold in the gross ceiling of the bathroom didnt really feel safe even with the door bolted felt like the kind of place that would have hidden cameras or a way to unlock your door in the middle of the night
to top all of this off when we checked in the desk clerk asked when we wanted a wake up call and when we wanted the shuttle to take us back we said  for the wake up call and around  for the shuttle we never got a wake up call but luckily set our phone alarms just in case then we get a call a little after  saying the shuttle will be here in  minutes so we get down just a little after  within  minutes and the shuttle had already left we asked the clerk and he just stated the current time implying we should have gotten there earlier we had to wait another  minutes to get the next shuttle another couple had the exact same problem and was waiting too at  the clerk called another room telling them the shuttle would be here in  minutes we got on the shuttle at  and the other guest who had been waiting with us asked the driver if there was any one else coming and if we needed to wait the driver shrugged and said he didnt know and started driving so another guest probably missed their shuttle just like we did
we would have probably been better off just sleeping at the airport or paying for a hotel or rental car ourselves if you have a choice dont stay here",1.0,1,0.0,0.0
