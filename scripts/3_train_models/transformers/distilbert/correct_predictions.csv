"Great and Friendly Experience
I recently had the pleasure to visit the Gansevoort Park Ave Hotel a few weeks ago and I have to say it was an amazing hotel. First off, when you walk into the lobby its quite a different vibe - great Rock 'n' Roll Music playing, purple chandeliers and very modern furniture everywhere. 
The rooms are very large for New York City and I love the separate tub and showers in the bathroom. The artwork in the room is impressive as it is a little bit more provocative - always intriguing! But if you're worried about people who maybe shouldn't be seeing anything provocative (i.e. children), I learned that they can flip all of the art to reveal different, neutral artwork for kids or more conservative clients. That part really impressed me because it shows that the hotel really cares about all of their guests, not just a certain type of clientele. 
The service is better than I thought it would be for a hotel that seems more geared to a younger crowd. Chris at the front desk was amazing!! He gave me great directions on how to get to the hotel and even recommended a great place for dessert right around the corner. Although I never had breakfast or room service, there is a great place across the street called Bread and Butter. I did get to try the main restaurant Asselina, though, during happy hour and I was quite impressed with the food and the design of the entire place. Unfortunately, I didn't get to go for a swim, which was a disappointment because they have an amazing rooftop pool that is partially indoors and partially outdoors. 
I'm looking forward to my next trip back to NYC and my next visit to the Gansevoort!!!!!!!",5.0,5
"One of the WORST experiences ever
We had the unfortunate opportunity to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Denver Tech Center on June 8-10. The hotel had booked a group of youth soccer teams in the hotel without advising the other cleints that the hotel would be OVERRUN with children. We had to move our room due to the noise, the public rooms were overriun with children, the pool,the excercise room and the business center were overtaken by children. Shameful, as the hotel was not prepared for the amount of children so basically we our room as the only quiet area. Spoke to management but unfortunately there is not much they can do. Unfortunate as we are Gold Hilton members and this hotel has let us down in every way.",1.0,1
"DONN'T BOOK AT THIS HOTEL YOU WILL REGRET IT!
We booked at this hotel in March 2012! What a scary place it is sooo noisy! The hotel is sooooooooooo run down and needs to be closed for maintainance! The AC make so much noise that you cann't sleep all night! Definetly not worth spending the money here at all! Stay in a back packers then this trust me you will regret staying there!",1.0,1
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
I went to New York to do a serious donor program.. I had lot of trouble checking in adn was treated like a piece of crap/ belittled. Most hotels take your credit card number incase of damage, this place deducted $200 off my card without telling me( its on on their website either) The room was HORRIBLE i specifically asked for a non smoking room and was put into a smokers room and told to ""deal with it"". There was pee all over my bathroom toilet seat, the wall outlets were hanging out, my bed STUNK and had hairs all over it , there was white mold all around the my room, crumbs all over the floor and it REEKED of smoker. I took pictures and wish this site allowed me to upload because you would be SHOCKED, VERY run down and absolutely NASTY for the price paid. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!",1.0,1
"Terrible Hotel Experience
I'm an Omni Select Guest Black Level member. However, I had the worst experience while on a ""last"" trip with my terminally ill brother-in-law and his two small children. I had to make 3 separate request to obtain a refrigerator for medications (thiss item is on my profile and at all other properties the refrigerator is already in my room when I check in). I contacted the Loyalty Ambassador/Concierge to insure my two rooms were adjoining to provide care for my two small nephews. I never received a response or had my request acknowledged. In addition, my keys were not ready per the normal express check-in method. 
At turndown, I was provided with one milk and cookie even though the two children were clearly on my portfolio and had to call down and request an additional milk and cookie. Someone charged a $54 bar tab and I had to dispute it twice before it was finally removed. Upon checkout, I went downstairs to obtain a copy of my receipts to indicate the credit for the bar tab and the young lady at the front desk was rude and condescending and irritated that I made her reprint my receipts.",1.0,1
"Very quiet and extremely comfortable
Stayed 6 nights at Sofitel New York in a king room and it was excellent. Every need is catered for. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever had in any hotel. The room was quiet, and very clean. We ordered room service food on the first night as we were feeling quite lazy after travelling, but it was so good we ordered again later in the week. Great location, can walk everywhere or the nearest subway stop is just 2 streets away. Loved having a separate shower cubicle and bath, would definitely recommend the place to anyone going to New York looking for a comfortable base for their trip.",5.0,5
"Rooms the Size of a Postage Stamp
I booked a room at this price thru Priceline and was totally disappointed. It CLAIMS to be a 3 1/2 star Hotel but there is no way it is. Smallest room I have ever been in, barely enough room for the bed (which was too short...I am only 5' 10 and my feet hung over the end of the bed!)..NO closet, NO office chair, hardly ANY space in the bathroom. NO amenities at this place like a fitness center or restaurant (they tell you to go next door). Back to the Hilton Garden Inn for me....so much for ""Boutique Hotels"".",2.0,2
"Perfect Location But...
...really needs a facelift (or more). Excellent friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Noisy but waddya expect in mid-town New York?",3.0,3
"Nice and Acceptable But Needs Upgrading
Stayed at this hotel for convenience. Our usual Embassy Suites was bought by another company. Hotel reception was acceptable, my honors level was recognized. Just found the room somewhat dated and the bathroom very small, door would not stay open and toilet leaked on floor. My preferences were not honored (my room was by an elevator). I also found the evening manager's reception to be in an unusual place (same area as breakfast) because they did not want it to conflict with the bar that served the inhouse restaurant. It was not unusual to see 15 people in line waiting for their beverage of choice. Would I return, probably yes because it is across the street from some fabulous restaurants and you can walk there in 5 minutes. If the Ritz (also nearby) has a similar room charge, I will change next time. They even forgot to give me my requested wake up call - my associate got his.",3.0,3
"Do NOT stay here
We booked our rooms as doubles since we stay for extended periods of time and employees come in and stay for a couple of nights then leave. While I understand and agree with extra person charges I do not think that the charge should be for the entire time of the room when the person only stayed for three nights. The proprietors were rude and continually tried to overcharge for for everything and would not refund the extra person charges even after the extra people left. In one of the rooms they kept trying to charge for the extra person and were told that there was no extra person there. The proprietor called them liars and said they had counted the suitcases in the room! Eww. Made people rekey their rooms daily so that the hotel could see if they were ""lying about the extra people in the room"". Also, there is a $10 per person, per night ""environmental charge"" they tack on - yes tried to charge for the extra person for the duration of the room booking and not just nights they stayed. This hotel is very un-secure. There is a outside door with direct access to a elevator that takes you anywhere in the hotel. It was not unusual to have hookers knocking on your door in middle of the night. One of the rooms had spiders, it was reported and no action was taken. Personal drinks missing from refrigerators, Holes in walls/doors. Missing towel racks. Just a dump with scary owner/management.",1.0,1
"Company Christmas party
This hotel was nice and the service was above average but either was nothing to rave about. After making the reservations on line I made a call to the hotel to verify that our guest would have no problem checking in, because both rooms were reserved under one name. Was assured that would be no problem, but that was not what happened. 4 calls later, 1 while my guests were standing in the lobby, I was told everything was taken care of. Long story short it was a constant battle to make sure all the billing was squared away. Breakfast in morning was wonderful and the hotel is in a great central location for the inner harbor.",3.0,3
"CASSA NEW YORK A HIDDEN GEM
Recently stayed with Cassa New York, superb location, one block from Times square, excellent value for money,rooms gorgeously appointed, but the staff are what make this Hotel outstanding. So friendly, genuinely happy and eager to please. Knowledgeable, courteous and allround fantastic. Hotel is nearly completed with new brasserie due to open soon which will be a great bonus to have! Will definitley stay again!",5.0,5
"Updated with historic feel
One night stay about 10 blocks from Georgetown, an easy Metrobus ride. Underground parking is very clean and secure, but tight. Rooms are updated, tempupedic beds, new baths, etc. Free wi-fi. AAA rate of $109 in DC, a great value! Nice buffet breakfast and they make omlets and waffels to order. A very nice place to stay.",4.0,4
"Amazing
Not only is the Adolphus beautiful decorated with museum quality artwort and beautiful wood paneling., the food is amazing, and the staff are beyond amazing. We had made a mistake on our reservations, but Mark and Aaron at the front desk worked hard to make sure we had a room and even up graded us to a beautiful comforatble suite. There was no snobbiness among the staff towards the clients, only a genuine willingness to make sure the stay was pleasant and rewarding. I've traveled all over the world. The Adolphus is the best I've ever stayed in.",5.0,5
"Right in the centre of things - comfortable oasis of calm.
I booked the Casablanca hotel on the basis of other reviews on trip advisor.
The hotel is located just off Times Square easy reach of everything in Manhattan.
No question - the hotel is definitely small and 'boutique'. Check in and welcome was fine. And my room was more than acceptable. Bathroom was great. I think I had a larger than average room and it was very comfortable. I slept well!
Loved the cheese & wine - complimentary each evening! Inclusive breakfast was good too!
Staff were efficient and charming (with one exception).
Having not experienced other NY hotels, I think I'd try a different hotel next time, but overall my stay was good - a definate 7+ out of 10 and I would recommend to others.",4.0,4
"Great location
This was our 1st trip to Philly so everything was quite the experience. We loved being in Chinatown and we're sorry we didn't find out about the 10th Street Market until the morning we left. Great location to walk to Indepence Hall. The rooms & service, it's a Hilton, not disappointed at all.",4.0,4
"Not what was expected
We felt this was a 2 star hotel with a 5 star website. Pool was not what was pictured on web and instead was filled with bugs and chaise lounges had old, used towels on them with tables filled with old food from previous swimmers. Tub was chipped, paint peeling off walls. Not at all what was portrayed on the website. We checked out after 2 hrs. Extremely disappointed.",2.0,2
"This stay tops them all.
When my daughter wanted to look at colleges in New York City, I knew we'd have to stay at the Affinia Manhattan. By booking on their website, you have several choices of ""special offers"", many of which make the choice very affordable. We had a studio room with two beds and kitchen/table area and a terrace.......for $199/night. INCREDIBLE!!!! The room was spacious, clean, and everything in working order. We were on a higher floor, (21, I believe), so noise was not an issue. Regardless....you are in a major metropolitan city.....get used to noise!!!! yes, the bathroom is small...but they make such good use of the limited space. Water pressure in the shower was good, towels were fluffy, toiletry items much appreciated. The beds were very comfortable, and we love the choice of pillow menu. Air conditioner work fine---room was quite cool, which was needed, as the outside temperature was in the 90's. Due to the excessive heat, we did not use the terrace, which had a table and 2 chairs, along with a nice view of surrounding buildings/skyscrapers. The kitchen area was compact, but again, all we needed was the fridge to store drinks and leftovers, microwave to heat things up, and the coffee maker. Elevators were all working, and waits for non-existent.
How can previous reviewers say there is nothing in this area to visit, nor good restaurants???? C'mon people, explore the neighborhood! Not everything has to be the ""Times Square bright lights"". We walked several blocks to the ""High Line"" and followed that to the Chelsea Market. Great place to try a variety of food: crepes, seafood, sushi, italian, ice cream, desserts, etc. Within a few blocks of the hotel, we found ""Asian Fusion"" restaurant.....3 course meal w/ bottle of wine for $39 thanks to ""Living Social"". Great food & service. Love the breakfast at ""Tick Tock Diner"". Being across from Penn Station is so convenient.....took trains uptown to Columbia University, Yankee Stadium and theaters; downtown to Canal Street and 9/11 Memorial. You just can't beat the location of the Affinia. I tell everyoe about this hotel, and will continue to do so. Hope to return soon.",5.0,5
"Small room and no noise insulation
We just spent 4 nights in this hotel. It was the first hotel that we have stayed in the USA. We booked it based on tripadvisor reviews. Overall the experience was just acceptable compared to previous hotels which we had stayed in. First of all:
Pros:
Efficient check in and out
Polite staff
Good central location a short walk to the metro
comfortable bed
Cons:
Small rooms ( not sure if it was standard dc size or because we secured a discounted rate via hotel travel.com)
No noise insulation ( could hear people talking outside the room, in the corridors especially after midnight, can hear the tv from the next room). It woke me up from sleep 3 times during our last night
A very slow draining bath",3.0,3
"Horrible Stay and Horrible Meeting
Booked a meeting with 50+ sleeping rooms and an all day meeting at the hotel. They screwed up the rooming list (and blamed us until they found they updated list that they never entered). Told participants they didn't have reservations, hotel was full, they would have to find somewhere else to stay. Some were checked in and then found that their rooms were dirty and never cleaned after the last guest checked out.
The sleeping rooms were musty and old. Bathroom fixtures all chipped and stained. As previous posters have said, the air conditioning leaves alot to be desired. I had it set to 60 and it never, ever got close to that. The AT&T wifi in the rooms was down more than it was up. (They blamed AT&T). The toilet in my room had a dripping noise that didn't stop for 2 days. 
For the meeting in the ballroom, the food was the only positive. Breakfast and lunch were good. That being said, the room was a mess when they set it up. Several of the linens on the tables were stained and dirty. 
Overall, can't believe how bad this hotel was. Not only was the facility disgraceful, the level of service was unbelievably bad. At every corner the hotel staff didn't care. They said it was our fault or just simply moved on. Only after speaking with the hotel manager did I see any results. (That being said, I saw her in the hallway the next day and she averted eye contact and didn't even acknowledge me or ask how our meeting was going.)
They did mention they are about to renovate. That might help the facility - but they need to renovate the staff a bit as they were rude beyond belief.
They promised a bunch of Starwood points for the meeting and all the problems. We'll see. I'm not holding my breath.",1.0,1
"Nightmare welcome to New York
Be warned, the new rooms you see in the pictures are not where you will stay unless you pay more! You will be put in the old and depressing rooms! We arrived in New York excited and looking forward to starting out trip but we were extremely disappointed when we arrived at this outdated and frankly miserable hotel. This hotel does New York no justice! The reception staff were rude and standoffish and were in no way prepared to upgrade our room despite it being my birthday and having submitted a request prior to arriving. We went up to our room to find that we could barely fit ourselves and our luggage in the room let alone open our suitcases to unpack. We were in shock at what we had arrived to. The room was extremely outdated with a massive stain on the carpet. There was no way we could stay in this room, so we returned to reception to request a bigger room which we should have been granted in the first place. One particular member of staff was not sympathetic at all and offered us one of the newer rooms at a premium of $50 per day which we thought was absolutely ridiculous having already paid a fortune for this disappointment of a hotel. My partner then decided to speak to a senior member of staff as he had received email confirmation that we would receive some sort of upgrade. After much persuasion we were only put in a slightly bigger room which again we hated. The only nice thing about the room was the bathroom, entering the room and the bathroom were like entering two different eras. We felt very depressed in this room and would rather have returned back home, however we just made the best of a very bad situation. The only polite members of staff were the doorman, the bellman and a few people at reception. The cleaners were also nice and kept our room clean. The location was the only other decent thing about this hotel as were situated only a few blocks from times square and from the empire state building so we found walking to places very easy. Despite the good location, we would rather have stayed somewhere which was further away then here. There is nothing much more to say about this hotel apart from do not go here! If you want a terrible memory of New York then stay here but if you want to remember the good things about New York then book in advance and get a good deal at a nicer hotel. This hotel should be shut down! Overall New York is expensive but a memorable city.",1.0,1
"Fantastic hotel, staff, location - well recommended
This is a fabulous hotel with the best staff ever, special mention to Neesha and Joseph who went out of their way for us. We stayed for 5 nights in early June, our first visit to New York. It was a special celebration and the hotel could not do enough, we were in a quiet room on the 31st floor with views of the Empire State Building on one side and the Hudson on the other. The room was spotless, comfortable beds and pillows and a great coffee machine. - celebration cakes left in our room on the first day. 
We were there for the free mexican food and drinks night - fantastic.
The location is so central with all of Hell's Kitchen restaurants a 2 minutes walk away. The area doesn't look too bad and I can honestly say we had no hassle at all.",5.0,5
"Hard to find!
The hotel is great once you get there. Even with a gps, google map app, and a yahoo map print out, we drove past it three times before we found the entrance. We could see the sign, but couldn't find the road. While we were waiting at the front desk, several people made the same complaint, and the desk clerk took two phone calls of people trying to locate the hotel. However, the rooms are very new, clean and comfortable. Now that we know how to get there, we would probably stay there again.",4.0,4
"Spring break beauty!
This hotel was incredible! Once again a priceline great deal! Great location by shopping at the Galleria, other shops and food. The valet service was unbelievable. Was traveling with several teen girls and they made sure we had everything we needed and always knew where we were going with great suggestions along the way. The room was BEAUTIFUL. With 3 teens and a mom we walked in and were blown away at the boutique quality and decor. And room there was room for us and more. The bathroom was a great size and the vanity had drawers! Shower extremely clean...Also a big plus - traveling with girls - was the large mirrored vanity outside of the bathroom and the wonderful entry that held the huge closet. We will be back. The girls all used the work out gym and said it was great. We did not use any of the other hotel services but what we saw was wonderful. This hotel is HUGE - can tell it is a business hotel designed for business conferences etc. But we felt like it was a beautiful posh hotel. We will go back.",5.0,5
"Cookies to Kill For
Doubletree's slogan is ""Where the little things mean everything."" While their intent is surely to imply that their attention to detail offers a superior hotel experience, it should be noted that the converse is also true. When little things are overlooked over and over again, it adds up to a pretty annoying stay. 
Start with arrival: 4 women on a trip carry a lot of luggage. We pulled up to the front so that we could unload our bags prior to parking the car. My friend went inside and took the elevator up to the lobby to request a bellhop. The person behind the desk pointed to a luggage cart and said ""You can use this."" 
So, after tipping my friend $10 for loading the bags, we went to park the car. The facade of the hotel is on S. Front Street in Columbus. That is where you enter. On the same block, just down the street, is a parking garage, which one would assume is where guests at the Doubletree would park. Being the only parking garage anywhere near the hotel, we parked. When we entered the elevator and saw no indication of buttons leading to a hotel lobby, we figured out we were at the wrong place. We headed down to street level and walked up the block to the hotel entrance. Doubletree's defense, the parking garage had no signage indicating that it was Doubletree parking. In our defense, it had no signage indicating that it wasn't. We later find out the the ACTUAL Doubletree parking is in fact around the corner from the entrance, not just down the street from the entrance. Here is where a sign at the main entrance stating ""DOUBLETREE PARKING AROUND THE CORNER"" would have been most helpful. 
Upon check in we neither asked for, nor received the signature chocolate chip cookie that Doubletree hangs its hat on. Our room was a decent suite, with the bedding being the most stand-out feature of the room. The outlets were poorly accessible, with an outlet in the lamp base nearly shorting out my phone. There were ample towels and the room appeared clean, if not a bit dated. 
The next morning we pulled out of the (wrong) parking garage and were asked for our parking voucher from the hotel. What parking voucher? Exactly. I imagine our chocolate chip cookies were somewhere wrapped in the parking voucher. We paid the full price and decided to deal with the parking issue upon our return, as we had an appointment to get to. 
Upon return to the hotel, we went to the front desk to rectify the parking snafu. The woman explained that we should have asked for the voucher when we checked in. We explained that they should have presented the voucher to us (along with the cookies) when we checked in. Sensing a stalemate, the clerk waived the parking fee for the prior night and presented us with the necessary parking vouchers for the following day. 
But what about the cookies? As we wrapped up the parking predicament, a cookie sounded like a delicious idea. Lamenting diplomatically that we had ""missed out"" on the cookies the night before, would the clerk mind providing some now. Oh if only she could. We're out of cookies, she said with a shrug. See, here is where a little thing like ""...but I'll be sure to send some up to your room as soon as we get more!"" would mean everything. No. We're out of cookies. When we expressed disbelief that a hotel chain that features said cookie prominently on it's literature, in its ads, and on its website would be unable to provide the lure, the clerk shrugged again and said ""People kill for those cookies."" I'm not sure if that was meant to be an explanation as to why there were no cookies, or a hint as to how we could procure some for ourselves. At any rate, no cookie. 
The next morning at checkout, the lobby was a buzz of hysteria. Apparently, there had been a rash of break-ins in the (right) Doubletree parking lot. Windshields smashed, property stolen, glass everywhere. The clerk (same one from the previous night, clearly on a 48 hour shift) seemed dejected, but not defeated. She remained calm, cool, and polite, even as we four parking perpetrators approached her station to check out. Her only concern was whether we too had been broken into. We hadn't. She heaved a sigh of relief, checked us out, and handed over 4 chocolate chip cookies. Still warm.",2.0,2
"Almost there
This is a nice elegant hotel for a weekend in NYC. We were upgraded to a Superior Guest room which was spacious. We had requested a few things pre-arrival which was not there, but as soon as they where reminded everything was quickly there. However it is not suitable for businesstravellers. Their wifi is very very slow. They have a business center where you can pay for high speed(??) internet, but then one can just as well work from a cafe close by with proper wifi...Breakfast is great with really nice fresh high quality bagels, muffins, croissant and a choice to order grenola youghurt or oatmeal with lots of fresh berries. They did not inform us of this the first days as staff was not very attentive to us early birds. They open for breakfast at 6.30 but are not really ready before 7.00. We were there for a week and this happened every morning. Some of the staff came in really late and sometimes the kitchen was not ready. But it tasted great!! The gym and the elevators have aerosol airfresheners-can you imagine someone spaying hairspay in your mouth when you are running?? No, right? Please remove those!! We also noticed that the doormen in this hotel got really agressive when several other guests did not want them to take care of their luggage. This is so unnessesary!! Take it with a smile when the guest wants to carry their small suitcase and do not want to pay 4 dollars for the service. This could be an excellent hotel with more serviceminded and attentive staff.",3.0,3
"Safe city hotel
First stop in a whirlwind tour of CA with our two kids (aged 5 and 8), the Tuscan Inn was clean and reasonably comfy. If you're adverse to tourism and tack don't stay at Fisherman's Wharf. We usually are, but with kids it was a perfect location for getting over the jet lag, getting into American life and accessing the main attractions, not to mention the ease of transport, car hire, supermarket etc. Good service, and unusual for a hotel, amazing Italian restaurant which seemed to have a reputation of its own. Its all you need for a comfortable, good value city stay.",4.0,4
"Groupon saves this ...
We used our Groupon for a corner suite and only paid $120 versus the regular $250+ rate. I would never pay the regular rate for this room and would have been extremely disappointed if we had. Their website says this is a ""urban boutique"" ... it's not, in any way. But it's a perfectly fine $120/night hotel. 
Upon arriving, valet was not very helpful - I had to unpack the car by myself (and I'm 8 months pregnant). The lobby is very utilitarian and could use an update. The room was nice in regards to that it was a suite and we were traveling with a toddler so we appreciated the extra room. The rooms were big but could really use an update. Bed was comfy. The big desk chair sits awkwardly in front of the TV. Room service was mediocre and the girl that answered my call was very unknowledgeable about the menu. My biggest complaint is that I called valet to bring the car around as I needed to grab some forgotten things only to find that when I went downstairs the valet guy WALKED me to my car ... I'm in heels, very pregnant and am walking up (and then back down) a steep concrete ramp to my car only to have him say ""hope you don't mind the exercise."" We also had a problem with the card key and after making two trips to the front desk someone came up to let us in - an apparent problem with the lock. When I called valet to bring the car around the next morning, I was asked if we were checking out ... but never asked if someone could help us with our bags. This would have been nice. Also, when outside the valet guys were making fun of a homeless guy, which I found to be very tasteless.
Location is perfect, but this isn't the type of hotel you ""enjoy"" visiting. Next time I'd rather pay a bit more money to stay somewhere a little nicer and more hospitable.",3.0,3
"Overpriced dump
Great location, but the hotel is very noisy (from people walking on the upper floors and the hallways) and the rooms are very overpriced for what they offer. I've stayed at the Sheraton across the street before and it is much nicier. I recommend the Sheraton instead.",2.0,2
"Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel
This is my first review. We were so excited to stay in this hotel. I didn't care that it was small. We got our keys, went upstairs, turn on the light, and BAM! Huge cockroach on the floor. I ask my girlfriend if I'm seeing things, so she goes closer - the thing starts running fast, so it was very much alive. We go downstairs for a refund, and we had to fight with the man at the front desk to get one. He NEVER apologized - not once. I might have actually forgiven them if they had shown the least bit of customer service, but no. His first suggestion was that they spray the room. We were appalled - they weren't even going to move us initially! As though we paid for a night in the hotel to hang out with dead bugs and toxic spray. Then, he offered to move us, but by then, we were disgusted with the hotel's service, we refused to pay to stay there. We finally got our refund (trust me, I'll be checking my credit statement this month), but not without him acting disgusted with us and telling us ""well, if you want to go home, then fine."" If this were any other hotel, they would've comped us a room for the night at the least. Even he'd apologized at any point, I might not have written this review - but there you have it. A cockroach in your room is disgusting - but the customer service was even more disgusting than that.",1.0,1
"Horrific!
I think Motel 6 would have been better! Wow is the website and pictures misleading!!!!! The amount of chemicals they must clean the room with is insane! Overcome with fumes when we walked in! The room is old looking and needs a lot of updating! The lights didn't work in the room, nor did one of the phones. Then to top it off, I called to ask what time the bar was open until and the male employee proceeded to say very rudely that they were closed and hang up on me. That's when I had enough and decided I did not want to stay there. So, I went to the front desk and said I wanted to leave. Thankfully they honored that request. While we were standing there at the the front desk, a woman came up and was like are you complaining as well. She was very upset and said the internet is misleading as well and she was not going to stay there too. Needless to say at 10pm, we changed our hotel chose to go to the Hyatt, a much better option for only $10 more. Also, the beds at the Kona Kai are from like the 50s. Look at your other options before staying here! We had the best experience at the Hyatt! Well worth the extra $10!",1.0,1
"Terrible hotel
I paid a huge amount of money for a very small room the week of 6/4/12 that had mold and mildew in the bathroom, towels that didn't look fresh, a messy bed that was barely made, and to top it off, housekeeping decided to clean rooms on the floor at 10:30 p.m. at night. I called the desk and asked them to have them stop but they never did and made a ton of noise slamming doors, etc. I will never stay there again.",1.0,1
"Stay a way!
Where to start.. I spent 3 nights at this hotel and I really wish I had not. I wish I had stayed at the Hyatt next door. I will start with the room, in my room (I shared this room with my sister in law) the air conditioner was acting funny and there were sounds of electrical spark and it sounded very unsafe. I called up the front desk about the issue and they sent up a maintenance man who just smiled as we were explaining what was going on and then tried to explain to us how to use an air conditioner as if we have never stayed at a hotel that has that same kind of air conditioner and it was in a very condescending tone. After I told him he did not have to speak to me in that tone and that I was a smart woman and new how to use an air conditioner and that he was not listening to what I was saying he laughed and then pretended to look at the unit. As he was doing this he got another call about a gas leak on the same floor. Let me just say how unsafe I felt. He did absolutely nothing and I had to usher him out of my room when he said there was nothing wrong, he just stood there and tried again to tell me how to use the an air conditioner. When asked to leave he still kept standing their smiling. It was all very creepy. 
This hotel offers free kits. They really should not because they never got them right during our stay. I pre ordered my kits 2 weeks prior to my stay. I requested two as there are two people in the room and we are not a couple. I ordered the walking tour and there was nothing in it. No maps, no ipod or nano just 1 bottle of water and that was it. What a waste. When I told them at the front desk about it they said they could bring me a new one later. We where headed out as we did not have a lot of time for sightseeing we where there for family reasons. I requested the BYOB kit and requested two wine cases as we (and our family) were going wine tasting and we may by more than two bottles of wine. I told them them we were leaving in the morning and we would like it ready for then. they said no problem it would be in our room waiting. We got back from sightseeing (without the kit) and dinner, when we got to our room there was no kit. I called the front desk who said everything would be there and the kit would be completed, and told them it was not here. they told me they could not do it and that they could have it ready for me in the morning. I asked if I could pick it up on my way out in the morning at 9am at the front desk. they told me that would be fine. At 9am I went down to pick up the items and leave for the day and it was not there. They told me if I wanted to way 20 minutes they could have it ready for me. I did not have time to wait. So no kit. If your going to offer something as part of your experience at their hotel they should be more on the ball with it. 
Finally my bill... I had found a rate of $145 per night I asked if they priced matched I was told no. When actually looking further on their website I found out that they do. I called back and I was told the best they could do for my room was 150.00 a night an that the price was non refundable and that I would have to pay now for it. I said that was not a problem and they charged my credit card. My sister in law got to the hotel before me and she checked in. They took her credit card and told her it was for incidentals. We got our bill at check out and they charged her credit card for our stay. So they billed us twice. Once on my credit card and once on hers, after telling her they were only taking her credit card number for incidentals. I got on the phone right away with the front desk at this point I was very very displeased with our service the lack of customer service and the fact that I did not feel safe in my room any longer. I was told they could give me a breakfast. I declined the breakfast, as I did not have time to sit and eat breakfast I had a plane to catch. She said she would have the manager contact me. As I was getting ready to go the manager called up to the room and wanted to know what he could do. He cut me off and said well I will take $5.00 off a night. I found this rude as I was not done with what I had to say and told him to hold on a moment as there is more. Then he proceeded to tell me that he had another customer and that he would have to call me back. This was completely rude. Why is that customer more important than me, why does that customer deserve his attention and my concerns and issues are not as important to him. This is bad really bad customer services and I feel he should not be the manager any longer. I told him to contact me at my home I had a plane to catch. Because of this I missed my train to the BWI airport and had to take a more expensive train to get to my flight in time for take off. So it cost me more money because of their lack of customer care and lies. I feel lied to and cheated. I called back quickly because I did not realize that my sister in law was leaving later and she really wanted breakfast. I was told that it was non transferable and that she would not get the breakfast. I was so upset that I told her that she is listed on my room and they still told me it was not transferable. I told her that this was highly unacceptable, she said"" fine I will giver her the breakfast"" but she has to sign for it and then they will take it off the bill. I said fine. I had to leave. She order her meal and it was the most greases and disgusting meal. She wished she had not ordered it. 
I was thinking about staying here in August with my family; however, after this experience I am not going to stay here and I would not recommend it to anyone either. I have stayed at some really nice places and this is not one of them.",1.0,1
"Splendid Time At Hotel Elysee!
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Elysee over the Martin Luther King Holiday. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the three J's, Josh, Jason and Juan at the reservation desk. All three were pleasant and professional. When I originally booked our room with Jason, I had mentioned that we were in town to visit our brand new granddaughter. Boy did we luck out! Our room was a deluxe king corner room on the ninth floor. It was just perfect for us! The first thing I did was take pictures[added a few here]. The room was charming with a very comfortable bed and very fine linens. The crystal chandelier and room decor reminded me of a hotel we stayed at in Vienna, Austria. The Hotel Elysee was in a great location, not far from our son's apartment. We frequented the lovely Club Room during our stay. My husband and I enjoyed the light classical music in the background, as we sipped our tea and sampled cookies. I would go back just for their fresh-baked bagels and other treats at breakfast. All in all, it was the best time at Hotel Elysee!",5.0,5
"Great Free Breakfast
I just got back from a night at the Residence Inn Phila. Center City. The location is great, within walking distance to the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, the National Constitution Center, The Gallery, The Reading Terminal Market, and lots more. The only parking is valet, and it's not cheap, but it was convenient and our car was delivered in a timely manner. The staff were all very friendly. The included full hot breakfast was lovely. There was anything you can imagine to eat. You can cook your own hot waffles, there were prepared breakfast sandwiches, prepared yogurt parfaits, plus eggs, sausage, hot and cold cereal, 3 different juices, coffee, tea, etc. I could go on and on - it was quite a nice breakfast in a beautiful room. They thought of everything - there was even whipped cream for the waffles. The room we had was a suite with a separate bedroom, living area, and fully equipped kitchen. The room seemed older and had old style tv's in both the bedroom and the living room. The bathroom was comfy and the bed was soft, with a couple different types of pillows. I can't stress how helpful and nice the staff was. I would stay here again.",4.0,4
"A night with smoke
I requested a non-smoking room, but was given a smoking room by mistake, since the motel was full due to the Del Mar Fair, I was stuck. The room smelled very bad, 3 cigarette stains on the bathroom counter, the bedding smelled like smoke. I even went and bought a can of Lysol, and it didn't help much. 
Staff at front desk was friendly and apologetic, but she was too young and inexperienced to be able to do anything for me in the way of a discount, credit or anything.
I often travel to Baja for surfing trips and stay in some pretty low end facilities and I am used to subpar room, but I'll have to say this one was the worst. Luckily it was only one night.
So anyone staying here, beware.........",1.0,1
"Very nice and Very romantic hotel!!!
My husband and I decided to take a quick weekend getaway this past weekend and we had never stayed on the Riverwalk before. We normally stayed somewhere in San Antonio and drove everywhere we went. So we booked a room at this hotel and all I need to say is this is where we are staying from now on. We had read a lot of really good reviews prior to our arrival. The only bad reviews we read pretty much all said the same thing....that the hotel was very dark. I do see where that is true. It is a dark hotel upon arrival but to me that is what adds to the romantic atmosphere. The decor of the lobby and entrace is very nice. Every single person that worked at this hotel was so nice and informative. When we checked in we got an automatic upgrade to our room and every day when we would come back to our room in the afternoon the bed would be made and everything cleaned up. The first day they left chocolate for us and left romantic music playing lightly in the room. Needless to say this was a perfect getaway form my husband and I. 
P.S. We could hear pretty clearly walking around and talking in the middle of the night both nights but like I told my husband...we are staying in a public place so I expect to hear some thing and it not be completely quiet.",5.0,5
"AVOID
Awful hotel. Awful staff. Noisy, tiny rooms. Poor security. Dreadful wifi.
We were staying at The Empire when Sandy hit, and the staff COULD NOT COPE. No communication, little assistance.
Do not stay at this hotel, unless you enjoy arguing with front desk everyday. Seems like since they've been a filming location for Gossip Girl, they've forgotten all about hospitality.",1.0,1
"Upper East at its very Best
We held our wedding ceremony, reception and party at The Carlyle - the day before Sandy arrived. It was truly magic. All arrangements were perfect, the rooms looked gorgeous, the staff was incredibly helpful (i.e. they managed to find a seamstress at 11 pm on Saturday night to help us out with an urgently needed alteration for a dress) and all very caring.
During and after ""Sandy"", the hotel continued to provide outstanding service with staff members working round the clock, looking after the wellbeing of their guests.",5.0,5
"Great affordable place
We were really pleased with the quality of the hotel. They had the best included breakfast we have ever had, including waffles in the shape of Texas! Staff were very friendly, and appreciated and acted on a few comments we offered. We especially liked our room on the backside of the hotel. We will certainly recommend this place to anybody traveling in the area. They were in the process of replacing all TVs with flat screen ones when we were there. And if you have time, check out their DVD and book lending libraries. Thank you very much for making our 4 night stay very enjoyable.",5.0,5
"Small suites and they charge you for everything...
Overall this is a nice hotel. We went as a large family expecting a suite too be roomy and it was very small. Also, They charge you for internet, breakfast, and parking which I think should be included in the price. The location is fantastic. local to everything you would want to see or do in Dallas.",4.0,4
"Cool hotel - comfy and great location in the heart of North Station!
I. LOVE. THIS. HOTEL. Boutique and trendy....plus a block from Canal St. and walking distance to the T, Garden...awesome spot to stay! $10 credit to the mini bar in our room - whom doesn't love that! Comfy bed and nice pillows as well. You can also have a goldfish as company in your room for the night if requested. We refrained but it was nice to walk to our hotel tipsy from Boston Beer Works. Next time we are back in the city I am sure we'll crash here.",4.0,4
"Worst value of hotel I have stayed in my entire life
I travel 100 nights per year, high end hotels, lower end hotels, the whole range. Rooms were limited in NYC 16 May 2012. I picked Paramount. The room was a tiny 10 feet x10 feet, the shower was 3x3. Paint was peeling off the walls. The A/C did not work, and it took engineering 2 hours to fix the problem. There were 5 exercise machines in the gym for 567 rooms in the hotel. 2 of the machines did not work. Needless to say, there was no possibility of working out.
If the room were $50 per night, that might have worked. For $800 per night, including tax, this was the worst value for a hotel I have ever experienced. People in the elevator were randomly complaining about the hotel on every ride in the elevator.
Avoid if you can, unless you like overpaying or wish to be adjacent to the Scientology Church in NY.",1.0,1
"Good and nice place where to stay in San Francisco
I enjoyed my staying at Hotel des Arts very much. It's not a luxurious hotel but is very nice and quite. The location is excellent to reach any touristic attraction or the Moscone center for conferences. The hotel is a very good value, people at the reception are nice and helpful, it is possible to leave the luggage if you have a late flight and have to leave the room. I definitely recommend this hotel.",4.0,4
"Free Drinks, Free Food, Only one thing missing ....
I had to take a moment to say a few words about how awesome this hotel is. They are very friendly courteous and efficient. They give all their guests a free buffett breakfast everyday including an omelette bar, and at 5:30 to 7:30 every night they hold a Manager's Reception with free drinks (alcoholic drinks included) and free finger foods. The beds were comfortable and living areas accommodating for three people to a room. We had a great time and because we stayed here, it cut our costs for breakfast and evening drinks out of our travel costs. I saved some good money here. Built in a giant square, the lobby is in the center of everything, piano playing incidental music by itself, friendly courteous staff willing to accommodate your every need. 
The only uncool part is that they have no free wifi. it's 14.95 a day!! for a student, thats way to much. They have a few free computers onsite to use, but when you are there for business the ""NO FREE INTERNET"" makes it a problem. I would stay here again and recommend it anyways. 
Hop over to the Sheraton next door, if you need free internet. They have free wifi in the lobby.
ENJOY",4.0,4
"Do not recommend Fairfield Inn Manhattan/Chelsea
The daily rate was way over priced at $479 a night. The service was the worst I've experienced. The Front desk clerks were rude and unfriendly. The room was decent, however personally had to tell the maid not to clean my room at 9:00am I needed time. She shows up comes in while I""m sitting in the room and cleaned around me. I was staying two more nights. She didn't speak english and she ignored my request. She rushed through the cleaning barely making the bed. Their complimentary breakfast was more like boxed breakfast. NO restaurant or room service. NO movie chanels. I wouldn't stay their again very disappointed the whole way around. Many other hotels in NYC that I would recommend first!!!",1.0,1
"Bypass this one
I'm a frequent traveler and this hotel is absolutely, hands-down, one of the worst I have ever stayed at. I changed rooms three times in three days here: broken heaters and broken faucets. There were insects in the bed linen. Poor taste and poor quality of the furniture in the room. The internet connection was unreliable. It felt more like a 'skid row' flophouse than a boutique hotel.
It did not feel clean at all. Try slipping under the covers of your bed after a silverfish has scurried out. Forget a good night's sleep!
The saving grace of staying here is the Millenium restaurant downstairs in the hotel but not connected to the hotel. It is a wonderful place to eat and I would come back to the restaurant no matter where I was staying in the city.
I'm amazed by the other reviews. It is as though these people stayed at another facility than the Hotel California I stayed at on Geary Street in San Francisco. Seriously, find another place to stay in San Francisco where you are not fighting with bugs for a warm place to sleep.",1.0,1
"Like staying with elegant family
Lovely, understated, classic accommodations with staff that can't be beat. The staff were incredibly attentive and well-mannered. The rooms are lovely, well-appointed, and very clean. The lobby is cozy and elegant, with a working fireplace and nice-looking, comfortable leather furniture. The location is fabulous- walking distance to fantastic shopping, great sights, and wonderful restaurants.The hotel restaurant was the best of them all however- delicious food, great waitstaff, and lovely atmosphere. What a gem of a place!
I will definitely stay at The Talbott when I return to Chicago.",5.0,5
"Expected much more
For a pricey hotel, the only appreciably upscale part of this hotel was the downtown location. Pretty convenient to all city sites. Other than than however I felt like I was staying at a Holiday Inn. Rooms were rather bland, mattresses were not up to the Hyatt standard, hair dryer in bathroom wouldn't work, shower curtain coming off its rings, $25 charge for moving things around in the fridge, one little in room coffee, and the list goes on. Don't get me wrong, things were tolerable, but not what I would expect from the flagship Hyatt in Boston. It would appear that the hotel is under extensive renovation, and it may be going on for a while. As mentioned in other reviews there is an entry at the ground floor (at parking level), which requires an elevator to bring you up to the lobby level, where you get off and switch to another elevator to get to your room. Sunday brunch at the Hyatt, which can often be an event, was again something I might expect at a lesser hotel. If I was going to return to Boston, I likely wouldn't use this hotel again, based mainly on what you get for the price.",3.0,3
"Kids, kids, kids!!!
I know we were visiting on a Saturday, but the place was overrun by kids. It wasn't families with 2-3 kids, but families with 7-10 kids each. Despite being told at check-in we had to wear these wristbands for both the happy hour and breakfast, there were several tables of 10 kids, none of which had wristbands. The pool was overrun with rowdy kids as well, and the staff seemed to have no control.
The elevators were quite possibly the slowest I've seen. During the morning rush, there where 20 people were trying to get on the elevator, and even the hotel maids carrying huge bags of towels demanded to squeeze on the elevators with the crowd.
I've stayed in several Embassy Suites before, and I must say, this was my worst experience yet. Perhaps we were just unlucky to be there the same time as hundreds of kids, but as I mentioned, the staff didn't seem very friendly either.
Finally, despite the fact that it says it is close to the Children's Museum, it's several miles away. In fact, there is another Embassy Suites which is closer. I don't think I'll be staying here again on my next trip to Indy.",2.0,2
"management cannot be found - noise levels are abnoxious
Staying here currently as part of an overflow from a conference across the street at the Hilton.
Do not stay here if you want to be able to sleep at night the noise levels are obnoxious but noone wants to know.
1. Do not stay in a front room looking over the harbor - the train stop rings bells for 10 minutes at a time
2, Went to bed around 10PM but come 11 or so there was some kind of huge party downstairs. All I could here was bass resounding through the walls. Couldnt sleep even with earplugs. Called downstairs to ask what was going on ""party til 2"" that was all they would say - incredibly unresponsive. Think I was talking to a valey rather than hotel staff. I asked if a manager was available and was told ""no not til tomorrow"" They couldnt care less as to hotel guests comfort - were more interested in the party downstairs
3. Come 12 midnight the noise was still resounding. Called again and was told ""its done soon - shall I move you now if you dont like it?"" How could I move rooms at that time?? Girls name was Tania
Perhaps if you want to come here and party its a great place but stay away if you want to have any sleep during the week. 
After 12 the noise was still ongoing so went downstairs to talk to somone but there was no member of staff anywhere to be found. Front desk was abandoned and didnt know where to go to find anyone, The desks were empty but there were 10s of people falling over drunk, shouting and screaming and this was a Tuesday night Im payingover $200 per night for a noisy party hotel
who doesnt care about its guests so long as the bar downstairs is a fun place for the locls.
Will never stay in a Hard Rock hotel again

"not that bad
I stayed for 3 nights. Staffs were very friendly and helpful through our stay. The hotel itself was good although it has passes its best days. My room was large and comfortable with a walk-in closet, but it had an unusual layout. The bathroom was outdated and needed to add some decorations. There was no fridge in the room, only an old TV with normal cable channels. The location of the hotel was good in term of public transportation, with metro (BART) and bus stops just in front of the hotel. You can get to many attractions easily. There are some eating places closed by like Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Sam's Diner. There is also a farmer market at the UN Plaza, a kind of small park, less than 100 fts at oppsite blocks from the hotel. You can have fresh fruit here or some baked goods. However, the low point of the hotel is that there are many homeless people around the area; I didn't experienced bad things, though. They were around the area but did not approach to me or asking for anything. Polices were around regularly,too. I walked from the hotel to Union Square few times and they were OK, too. Only take precautions, do not walk alone during late night. it took 10 minutes (my speed) to Union Square but if you walk fast it will take 5 minutes.",3.0,3
"Very Comfortable and quiet
My boyfriend and I stayed here in the Towers for one night before he left to be abroad for a while. The room was nice and clean with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was nice, although the toilet was a bit weird-it didn't have the style of a toilet you would find in a home. Not a big deal though. The shower was nice and the water pressure and temperature was great. We had access to the private eating area, which was serving breakfast. I was a bit let down by this because the website made it seem like it was going to be a fancy area with a great breakfast that only the ""special"" guests would have since only the top floor has access. It was really just a room with some tables, chairs, and TVs and a really small breakfast and not much for service. The location of the hotel is amazing and super convenient. Overall though the hotel was very nice and we had no problems. I would stay here again.",4.0,4

Checkin and Checkout were efficient. Generally hotel staff were helpful and pleasant. The room appeared clean but the carpeting was very dirty.

However, the bathroom was clean and towels were fluffy. I expected a greater standard of cleanliness from Hyatt.",3.0,3
"Great Location
The hotel is perfectly located next to a Subway stop (51st St on lines 4-5-6) and within a 5 minute walk from Rockfeller Center and Grand Central Stn. The rooma are small, but are very good considering the price and location. Half the rooms face the back and have no view, and so is not for claustrophobic types. We initially on the 7th floor facing a wall, but the friendly staff let us change to a room on the 17th floor overlooking 51st St. Though the views were nice and the room was biiger, it was also noisier. Also the sound insulation between the rooms is not great and you can hear your neighbor's TV if it is turned up loud. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a Cafe Metro next door which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and of course there are dozens of resturants and food trucks nearby.",4.0,4

I complained so they moved me to another room and here what I found: The beds were smelling cigar, the bathroom floor was full of mold. There was a leakage of water that came almost to the middle of the room and I called them three times till they sent somebody. I had to put all the towels on the floor to be able to stand in the front of the sink. In addition to all of that the hair dryer was not working.
The Elevator was so slow so I had to use the stairs. The only thing was good is the meeting room, was not bad at all.",1.0,1

This is a great hotel, well located, very clean and very very cosy beds. It is silent so you can really rest.

"Capital DUMP, Nasty- Worst place I have ever stayed at
Let me first start off by saying- It was Spring Break and this was the only hotel around with availability (I now know why). We checked into our hotel late, 9:30 and it took my husband 20 minutes inside before he came back to the car. We get to our room and there was one bed made up and the other had no linens on it at all, my 7 year old said- aren't they supposed to make the beds? Not only that but there were no towels and the bathroom had not been cleaned, Ewwww.. At this point I was on the phone praying someone had cancelled a room at any other hotel but had no luck. My husband called down and they said that Spring Break was so busy and they couldn't keep up but they would send someone up to clean the room. I sat there and watched her clean the bathroom, make the beds and clean the room. The noise level outside was loud, you could hear everyone outside and everyone outside could pretty much see inside. We got up first thing, checked out went to see their mini hot breakfast- not sure where the hot comes into play unless you are toasting bread- they had stale bread and bagels, fruit loops, cheerios, apples, oranges and that's about it. Unless you are in a dire situation I would avoid this place! I will NEVER stay at another Howard Johnson after this experience.",1.0,1

It was the size for a small pet to sleep on, not (2) people and it came equipped with no pillows, blankets/sheets. Luckily, for the rude non caring runner, I(DAD) was not there when it arrived! So I called and complained, hr later I did get a sheet! Whoo! Hoo! We booked the park n fly. Parked while on vacation for a week, took there shuttle to the airport was told it would bring us back. NOT! When arrived at airport, no shuttle, I called the Hotel and was told to take the taxi and the hotel would foot the bill/fare.

Stayed here for 4 nights for a trip with my daughter - who needed to be in midtown. This is a good location - just up the street form Bryant Park and very close to Midtown locations that are tourist oriented. There is not a full service restaurant - but you are close to the garden variety of Times Square restaurants. Very clean and surprisingly spacious - the double double room perfect for families. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. I prefer Marriotts and prefer full service hotels - but for the price this cant be beat.",4.0,4
"Absolutely dreadful!
Never again! The hotel is dated, tired and frankly filthy! The amenities are the bare basics - not even coffee making facilities in the room. 
The only good thing about this hotel is its excellent location.
Our room booking was wrong but the reception staff did little to help - they were fully booked so it was an attitude too bad!
Not impressed!",1.0,1
"Wonderful buffet breakfast
I was a little hesitant to count on the breakfast buffet included with the room after reading a couple of reviews here, but it turned out to be wonderful! Very complete - waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt, juices, pastries, cereals, eggs, sausages, pancakes - all very fresh. Our room was very clean, comfortable and quiet; the in-room kitchen was well appointed, too. The view was not great, but that had more to do with the other buildings being so close. If you're a big TV watcher, you may be disappointed, as the TV in our room was on the small side - but hopefully, you're not there to spend much time watching TV. The front desk staff was very pleasant during check-in. The lower floor of the hotel has a nice gym and generous laundry room with lots of machines. If you have no problem with the statement they slip under your door the final morning of your stay, you simply pick up the phone, dial a specified number, state your name and room number and you are automatically checked out. It's all designed with an eye toward a hassle-free stay. We really enjoyed our time there, even if the price was steep - but again, every hotel in the Times Square area is pricey.",5.0,5
"Please Don't Stay
Im begging you!!!!! Very old and not updated in years. If you do decide to stay please be careful, not a safe environment at all. Blankets had holes in them from cigeratte burns. There was mold in the bathroom. My room came without a microwave and iron, which is suppose to be in every room. I spoke with the property manager and talking to him is useless. He is just out to get that money and is not concerns at all about the customers.",1.0,1

"Super location and very good service
We had not pre-booked this hotel and picked it by pure luck. 
We got a room on the 22nd floor with a fantastic view of the water front. Stayed for 3 days and the car remained in the parking. Walked everywhere or went by public transport.
Huge number of places to eat within walking distance.

This hotel is everything you could ask for! Beautiful property with excellent staff. The location is perfect if you want to walk downtown and if not, you are located right next to Seaport Village that has restaurants and shops. I highly recommend the Hyatt.",5.0,5
"Outstanding value
I was skeptical about staying here. Small hotel just west of SoHo, but was extremely pleasantly surprised at how perfect it was - especially for the money. The front staff, no matter the shift was always pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and useful (small, but nothing unusual for NY). You can't beat free breakfast in NYC. This is a hot (and cold) breakfast with eggs and waffles, etc. etc. Also, free WIFI in the room. The breakfast room itself has a lovely area that feels like it is outside. I spent hours working there (with WiFI). Even late in the day, the breakfast room has juice, coffee and fresh fruit. There is also a small bar off the lobby for an evening cocktail. The hotel is a block away from the start of SoHO and a couple of blocks from the west village, so very well situated. All in all perfect hotel for a business trip. My only complaint (given the low price of the hotel) is that the ice machine in the hallway sounds like a plan landing. Extremely loud all night long.",5.0,5
"Not for everyone...
Kinda marginal neighborhood next to boarded up school and housing project ... police sirens, incredibly noisy *public* pool party on weekends. If you consider yourself young, adventurous and a ""party person,"" this may just be the place for you! Desk staff was all right athough a little clueless. Seemed quite light on security. The restaurant employees and housekeeping staff were very friendly. (And the food in restaurant was tasty but an extremely imited menu.) My room on the sixth floor faced the Capitol (and the freeway), and was quiet other than the sirens, which I am accustomed to from home. Do not recommend for women unfamiliar with the area and traveling alone. I was a ittle unnerved by loud hallway sounds (I was next to elevator) and a guy having a long, profanity-peppered argument with someone while sitting outside one of the rooms on my foor!",2.0,2
"Great location - wonderful service!
We ended up at the Affinia through Priceline and it has to be one of the best hotels we have stayed at in NYC. Staff were so friendly and helpful and our room was excellent (loved the mini King Kong stuffed toy on the bed - cute touch!). But the essentials were all there too - clean room, easy checkout etc. The only thing I would change is the wifi - a lot of hotels are still charging and I feel like this should be a complimentary feature at this point.
Would absolutely stay here again!",5.0,5

You have to buy internet and breakfast!! Water stinks or maybe its just me cuz no one else has mentioned anything about it yet. i stayed here for 3 weeks, had no choice since company booked it, if I could personally afford i would have moved out somewhere else the very same day. not to mention i found spider(s) in my room. Air conditioner does not work, atleast it didnt work for me.",1.0,1
"Don´t ever go to this hotel
This hotel, due to the staff, who are totally liers and hypocriters. We choosed this hotel because we thougt It was a safe one. We couldn´t made a worse choise! we had a reservation til Wednesday, since the staff told us plent, I mean,several times that we had prepayed and everything was set till Thursday,we beleived that. I actually called the frontdesk In order to confirm and made her even check It out on te computer again. 
So after all of this, we trusted the Orchard hotels staff. When we arived to the hotel Wednesday evening, another staff told as tat we had to leave or pay for one extra night. We were so confused and ask to speak to te manager. We had a discussion and after an hour he understood the situation ant that they convinced us to stay, that´s a new agreement. We even ask him If he would like us to leave, in order to not pay for on extra night, that we didn´t choose to pay for!! He promised to forward the information till the morningstaff.
Thursdaymorning, we checked out, no problem. We left our bags in the Hotel for a couple of hours.When we got back to the Hotel, another staff,she called her self manager, told us that we had to pay!!!!??? We couldn´t believe this actually happened. After explaining one more time, made her call the first staff who told us that we had payd til Thursday, called the manager from last night, she told us, and even gave us a receipt that she didnt charge us for anything. That felt good but her behaviour was really rude.
All this cause us a really bad experience of San Francisco, we missed our night out att Wednesday night, te morning after, we didnt have time to take the Coastal road back to LA. And when I got back to Sweden I noticed that they, after all words, receipts and promises, charged us the fully amount for the room.
I have never been more fooled and see this bad behaviour before. Beyond that, the rooms are not specially good, I would say the standard Is about maximum 2,5 stars. 
DONT SUPPORT THIS HOTEL IF YOURE NOT WANNA BE FOOLED AND NOT FEEL SAFE!",1.0,1
"Stay & Cruise
Great location for a stay & cruise out of Baltimore. Because I was sailing in the winter and Baltimore is a 3 1/2 hour drive from my home, I opted for an overnight stay in Fell's Point. I wanted a quality hotel that was centrally located with secure parking for my vehicle. The Admiral Fell Inn fit all my criteria. The rate included parking for 8 days, a $25.00 food voucher and valet service to and from port. Rooms were comfortable and except for a stopped-up bathroom sink, were actually quite charming. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Valet service to port was also quick and convenient. Now, for the bad points. There is no elevator, so taking baggage to your room might pose a problem. I did get a member of the bell staff to help with luggage upon check-in, however, there was none available at check-out. Also, I wasn't aware of the haunted ghost tour or the Admiral's Reception, which I know I would have enjoyed. It wasn't until I came back to the hotel late in the evening that a large sign was posted in the hotel lobby. Staff should mention this to guests upon check-in. Overall, I was pleased with my experience and will surely recommend the Admiral Fell Inn and stay again when in Baltimore.",4.0,4
"Good Renovated Airport Hotel But Not Cheap
My last review of this hotel was in 2007. The hotel is now completely renovated. 
Location: Right in the middle of DFW airport but it's not connected to any terminals directly. It's a short walk though to one of the terminals from the parking garage where you can then access Skytrain for the rest of the airport. Free parking included. You can also get the airport tolls validated at the bell desk or the front desk.
Service: Good and friendly faces throughout.
Rooms: All renovated overall so the quality is good with new furnishings. Room size is good and the bed is comfortable. There is an iPhone dock that serves as an alarm clock. The bathroom does not have a tub but just a large shower. Large flat screen TV is the standard these days. Runway noise was not noticeable.
Breakfast: Booked on a corporate rate that included buffet breakfast (normal rate is around $17). Quality is decent. The omelette station does a good job, and the fruit selection was excellent. Cereal selection could have been improved though. Hyatt Place is better in that area. Coffee tasted diluted and poor. 
Other facilities: Didn't try the pool or the fitness center. There is ample convention space at the basement and a nice bar area. Internet costs money unless your plan includes it, or unless you are an elite Hyatt member.
Overall: The hotel is above average but it usually costs over $200 on weekdays so it doesn't come cheap.",4.0,4

The elegant foyer of this hotel is not a facade, it is REAL, gorgeous, and sets the tone for an exceptional hotel experience. From check-in to (and MUST MENTION!!!) concierge service, we felt 'cared for' and helped during our 4-day stay. The rooms are standard sized, the beds are above average comfortable, the view is always New York -as in 'other buildings' out every window (what else?) but what made me feel so good was the people who work there. The doorman hailed taxis for us, the restaurant was attentive, and the bar serves a great Manhatten.",5.0,5
"One of New Yorks's Finest Hotels
I just spent a long weekend in new York with my family. This was my second visit to the Setai on Fifth. From the moment you leave your cab, you sense this level of service that is hard to describe. Genuine hospitality with no pretension.
From the superb New York location on Fifth Avenue to the decor and sublime elegance of the design, this place is first class. From a value perspective, it also wins hands down. I have money and can afford any place in town, but I also love value. And the Setai delivers. Large, spacious and gorgeous rooms with great views. Non alcoholic drinks and Wi Fi are part of the deal. 
And forget what the person above said of the location on Fifth. How does this location differ from any other in the city??? Is this guy serious??? It's New York pal! The location is perfect.",5.0,5
"Stunning style in Soho
It is hard to find fault with this sumptuous yet low-key hotel on a quiet cobbled street in Soho. Our weekend stay, to celebrate a wedding anniversary, was flawless from start to finish. From reception staff who bent over backwards to make the weekend special for us, to a lavish and delicious breakfast served in our room, everything was utter comfort and peace. Wonderful power showers, heavenly beds, breakfast served on gorgeous bone china. 
Just one small criticism. Every time we wanted to access internet we had to phone down to reception - slightly irksome. But a tiny caveat in a sea of praise.",5.0,5
"Great stay
Staff was terrific at this hotel. They were constantly going out of their way to assist you. Suites are typical Embassy suite type - large and efficient. Breakfast was better than average since the omelettes were great. Location was good - a five minute walk through a clean park to the airport subway station which is two stops from the city center. Great restaurants just down the street - Santaripio's for pizza and Off The Boat for seafood. A great view of the city skyline from the room. I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind 15 minutes to get to the city.",5.0,5
"Clean but noisy; Very disappointed
First the pros: clean room and bathroom, with a comfortable and large bed. Free wifi is also great. Free shuttles to San Diego zoo and airport. Good location - within walking distance of the Gaslamps area, Seapoint, Midway, and maritime museum.
Now the cons: AmTrak line runs about 2 blocks behind the hotel and the trains run 24/7. What's worse is that they blow their horns consistently for literally 3-5 minutes each time they pass. Honestly, I've never been in a hotel room as noisy as this one. To be fair, this isn't something that Holiday Inn can do much about. HOWEVER, they can improve their 'ventilation' system. The bathroom has a sliding door with a frosted glass, which means you can see the person through the door, as well as hear EVERYTHING that happens as the door is not flush with the walls. This is bad enough except that the bathroom has Zero ventilation. There is an air vent however this is not sufficient to work as ventilation. When I complained to the staff I was told 'this is our central ventilation system, you wouldn't hear the rotor'. When I said that it wasn't working, I was told 'Well, that's how it works.' As the ventilation is non-existant, we had to keep the sliding door on the balcony open all the time, which means we had the constant noise of the trains all day and night. We asked to be moved but were told that all rooms were booked. Also, we were woken by a wake up call at 7am though we didn't order one.
All in all, I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend people stay here. I know the trains are out of their control but this noise really impacted badly on our enjoyment of the city and our holiday in general as we could not get a proper nights sleep. Very disappointed.",2.0,2
"Calm and Relaxing Hotel
I stayed here with my husband for part of a 5 day getaway to Seattle. Upon arrival the service from the doormen to check-in was excellent. Very welcoming and not too formal. Our room was quietly luxorious. Just a beautiful and comfortable room to relax. 
As others have stated the location just can't be beat. So close to the market and lots of terrific restaurants. Art is a nice place to have a drink with friendly bartenders. I asked doorman for a recommendation for a place close by to get a drink and he recommended the ZigZag, which we had been to before and loved, so I knew I could trust him not to send us to an overly touristy place. I would definately put this at the top of my Seattle hotel list.",5.0,5

"Great stay at the Burnham!
This is our third year in hopefully a long list of years to come staying at Hotel Burnham the night before Thanksgiving to celebrate my birthday.
The staff was wonderful, from some pre stay questions until checkout. The room was perfect, everything top notch and up to their usual standards.

"Decent but Not Up To Hilton Standards
I am by no means an expert in Hilton Hotels. I have stayed at 3 in 3 different states. However, I do travel extensively and would consider myself somewhat experienced when it comes to hotels. The reasons I can't give the Millenium Hilton higher marks are as follows:
Front Desk Staff: This was the one highlight I had. The staff at the front desk and the supporting staff were great. Very friendly and they had my requests on record and happily fulfilled them.
Pool and Gym: a rare find in this city, the pool and gym are great by all standards. If this is important then you can't go with this hotel.
Rooms: The room was clean but felt ""dark"". You can't expect any hotel to have rooms of any great size so I wouldn't take points off for that.
Concierge Lounge: as a frequent traveler, I depend greatly on the concierge lounge. This hotel doesn't have one! To me this is a huge deal breaker.
Restaurants: The restaurant was good. The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the ""bar"" is right by the elevators. I was traveling with my family and I didn't really care for the atmosphere for my kids.
Location: Great. I can't say much about that. 
Overall: If I was traveling alone I may have given it an extra point but I was with my family. I did not want to stay there with my kids. Hilton hotels and staff are great but the layout of the entrance didn't make it very kid friendly. There is nothing I enjoy more than to relax in the concierge lounge of a hotel after a long day of work but this hotel doesn't have one. It is truly a shame.",3.0,3
"Disgustible and shady
If it hadn't been midnight when I checked in, I would have left on the spot!
The room was dingy and smelly, the carpet stained in many places. The whole place (except the lobby, of course...) is old and damaged. And the elevator refused to let me out at my floor and kept me prisoner for a good 10 minutes.
I checked out the next morning and won't come back.",1.0,1

"Affine Hotel
Travelled to the Affinia New York from the UK with out two children 9 & 13 for a few days shopping and sightseeing. We had stopped here previously and had a very good experience so were expecting the same.
On arriving from Newark Int we were shown to our room which we booked through travel agents in the UK. Previously we had stayed in a one bed suite which had two bathrooms. 
This time the rooms had been newly decorated and were very bright an pleasant with modern fittings but only one bathroom.
The bedroom had two spot lamps in the ceiling - both did not work, also the sofa bed which had been previously made up on arrival was not. Nor did it have any sheets available for us to make the bed up. The bathroom also only had towels for two.
I went downstairs to discuss this with reception. The lady I spoke to was a little put out with what I had to say and that someone would be up to put things right in 15mins. One and a half hours later, still no sign.
We felt a little let down, however overall the general position of the hotel on 7th avenue is very good, and besides these issues we had a good stay.
The rooms are nicely decorated and generally the staff are friendly and helpful and for your first time in New York is a good place to stay.",3.0,3

"What more could you need?
I stayed here for 1 night with my husband and 10 yr old daughter. We had a suite on the 12th floor - we had checked in online and selected a suite on the 17th floor but when we arrived we were told the pool on the 19th floor had leaked into that room so we couldn't have it - strange but no big problem. Overall, the hotel does exactly what you need in a big city - provides a clean bed when you are exhausted after sightseeing, and a plentiful breakfast to set you up for the next day's activities, and this for a reasonable price. 
Pros: 
Location - close to Michigan Ave but away from much of the noise and bustle.
Breakfast - by no means gourmet but adequate fuel to get you through till lunch. Breakfast room well managed by multiple staff. 
Room was very clean.
Wifi - free for Honors members and fast.
Check in staff were very friendly and helpful.
Cons:
Room outdated with chipped bathtub, bed had blankets not duvet. 
Room smaller than other Homewood Suites we have stayed in (but I guess smaller rooms are common in big cities.)
Toilet and fridge were extremely noisy.
Elevators (only 2) were slow at peak times.

Decent rates by DC standards.
CONS:
Unless you have reason to be in that corner of DC, it is not all that centrally located.

"Rude staff, small/unclean rooms, do not eat in the restaurant
My experience in the Hilton Seattle was one of the worst I have ever had in a hotel. It is like a maze to get to the lobby to check in (which not only is on the 10th floor, but you also have to walk through the restaurant where people are eating). My husband and I had to wait in line for 20 minutes just to check in because there was one person working the front desk. In our hotel room, we noticed a black hair in the bathtub and it looked as if the mirror had not been cleaned at all. Not only that, but the size of the window in our room was literally smaller than my bedroom window at my home. It was very disappointing.
The worst part of our experience was our visit to the restaurant. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. After being seated, our waiter did not come around for several more minutes and when he finally came to our table, we received an attitude because we stated that we were ready to order food and not just drinks. When asking for water, I never received it. I had to ask a different server to get me a water and later had to ask the hostess walking by to refill my glass. Our food was something that I would expect from Denny's.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!",1.0,1
"Good rooms, reasonable value
A nice ""new"" type of hotel with spacious rooms, good service and high standards for cleanliness. The vibe is a bit sterile, but everything in this hotel seems to be well thought out from the front desk staffing, check in and lobby to the features of the room. Not a lot of charm - the hotel is a bit like a compact fluorescent bulb - you know it's practical and probably a good thing to have, but you might miss that warm glow from time to time. All this is to say that if you value charm in your accommodations, you might be disappointed, but if you are trying to get a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed with fundamentals done well, you will probably return to this hotel again and again.

"Hyatt Place Jacksonville Airport, Jacksonville, Florida
Hotel - The hotel is nicely kept and the lobby design is a bit different from most hotels I've stayed in. The lobby was very clean and nicely decorated. The front desk was rather small compared to other hotels and blended in with the Market Place where they sell food-stuffs and drinks. I had no problem checking in and the clerk was very friendly and efficient in her job. The grounds are nicely kept and due to the design of the entrance way; there are no close parking to the front door and if you arrive later in the evening everybody has occupied the few spaces that are available. The pool is rather shallow and only goes up to 5ft as well as on the small size so if your family loves the pool you may be a bit disappointed. The gym is small as in most hotels but they do have a few free weights to push around. Two computers at the business center, which is out in the main lobby so you may not want to do any very personal business such as checking bank accounts.
Staff - The staff (cleaning ladies, front desk clerk, breakfast clerk) are very friendly and helpful. Each day they wished me a good morning or evening with a smile.
Breakfast Kitchen - They really didn't have a large variety of breakfast items to choose from. they had small egg, ham, cheese type bagel for both days for hot food. They served the usual oatmeal, boxed cereals, milk (2% & skim), and orange/apple juices in plastic pitchers. To keep them 'cold' they where sitting on an ice cold surface. Unfortunately this only cooled the bottom of the container. I like my juices refrigerator cold and the drinks here where cool at best; they could do better keeping the beverages colder. They did have donuts/Danishes but donuts for breakfast? I did see people helping themselves but maybe I'm a bit too health conscious... They also had fruits.
Room - Ahhh now what makes a hotel a hotel! To me, the room is the 'make' 'break' of a hotel no matter what amenities they provide! The room was gorgeous! I loved the layout; I had a 2 queen bedroom. The room was divided between the beds and the 'living' area, which had a chair, work desk, couch with pull out mattress. The TV was a 42in flat screen that can be swiveled between the beds and living room. They also had HD channels and a sweet media hook-up panel that supports HDMI, USB, 15pin (VGA), audio cables and much, much more. You can connect your laptop to stream movies from Crackle or Hulu+ or other websites. If you have kids and if they bring the xBox, PlayStation and other gaming consoles; they can be hooked up as well. The sink is outside of the shower/toilet area and the bathroom had a very important feature; an exhaust fan! I can't believe some of the hotels I've stayed in didn't have this very necessary feature. Who wants to walk into a bathroom where another member of the family/party has just deposited some solids and the ummmmm.......smell......can't be exhausted out? The room was very clean and orderly; the only thing I couldn't find was a TV guide so I had to play around with the remote to find out where my favorite channels are located.
Area - The hotel is in a nice area with many restaurants to choose from and is located within a three mile radius. There a HUGE shopping center not even a half a mile down the street! The hotel is extremely close to the airport and situated slightly north of the downtown Jacksonville city.
Finding - The hotel was very easy to find and wasn't hidden off the beaten path. I used my cell phone and Google Maps, which took me directly to the front door and also had a photo of the entrance when I arrived. This was particularly helpful since I arrived just before midnight.",4.0,4
"Excellent one night stay
We flew in to Houston Hobby for one night pre cruise. We had read other reports to avoid staying near the airport due to undesireable location but it worked best for us and timing of flights in- Grandma flying in 6 hours before us and we wanted her to be able to check in without us. Her finding transportation independently to Galveston was not desireable. 
We made an excellent choice. She easily caught the free shuttle and checked in and we rented a minivan and checked in 6 hours later. The hotel was clean & comfortable. All of the staff that we encountered were wonderful & pleasant. We only needed one of our 12 bags for the night but did opt to bring in all our luggage from the minivan as we didn't want to present the opportunity for a car break in but we felt swawfe & comfortable staying at the location. We had free wifi- but we are spg so not sure if it is free for all. Would highly recommend staying here. The entrance was easy to find not sure why it was an issue for others that posted",5.0,5
"Disappointing Crowne Plaza
Very disappointed with this Crowne Plaza. It is a motel not a hotel. When you step outside your bedroom and it is outside that is a motel to me. We had a Club Room, very dark, needs updating. The club lounge was only open for a coupe of hours, free drinks and some hot food that was quite good. Breakfast poor, very limited. The hotel looked very old and sad.",2.0,2
"Nice but not living up to its potential
As others have stated, this hotel looks beautiful when you walk in. It is close to the River Walk and the Alamo, and across the street from a small park. So despite some shady-looking spots immediately near the hotel, overall it's a great location. Lots of wonderful restaurants within walking distance. 
 I love the fact that it''s an old building, and would overlook imperfections for that reason. However, that's no excuse for poor cleaning. All of the rugs in the hallways and in our room needed a thorough cleaning; there were stains all over them. We had a broken towel bar and a broken toilet paper holder in our room, and the sink backed up. I reported all 3 items but by the time we left on day 4 only the TP holder had been fixed. There were also blood stains (or something brownish red anyway) on the wall that never got cleaned although we reported that too. I'll say that the bed was wonderful - a big cushy 4-poster with nice linens. But then the bath towels were thin and worn. 
Some of the service was very good, and there were some bad experiences. I ordered a salad in Pete's Pub (the hotel's tavern) and it took 65 minutes to arrive. I was told that they were busy with a banquet upstairs, but shouldn't they staff accordingly? However the next morning breakfast was served very quickly and was delicious. My breakfast waiter was attentive and courteous. There are 3 places to eat: the lobby bar, Pete's Pub, and The Madrid. Yet all 3 had the same menu for the most part, with just a few selections (burger, salads, soup and sandwiches). So there is no fine dining in the hotel which i thought was strange. 
During our stay the hotel was swamped with two big conferences, so there was always a crowd at the front desk, yet I never saw more than two people working the desk. The desk clerks were frazzled and sometimes a little cranky. 
This could easily be a 5 star hotel. The history and architecture are wonderful. But it is under staffed, the restaurants need to overhaul their menus and the housekeeping is lacking. With some proper management this could be the premier hotel in San Antonio, but it's lacking some key elements.",3.0,3

- mini bar with lots of rules eg. ""No personal belongings"" (but there is an option to hire a fridge for that one item you would like to finish off later!)
- pay extra for parking, wi-fi
- windows that don't open - the standard claustrophobic box
As other reviewers have said, this is not luxury. The only thing it has going for it is location.
If you want to feel like you are at work rather than on vacation, this is the place for you.",2.0,2
"Great location, awesome staff
Spent 2 nights here at the end of March 2012. The location was perfect - literally 2 blocks from Times Square. The Thursday night h'orderves were pretty weak. Otherwise, everything about this hotel was superb. Super comfy beds! Free WiFi! Great view of the city. The in-room kitchenette came in handy. Last but not least, the staff were particularly great. Everyone we dealt with was incredibly friendly. In particular, Bradley and Jamie were both awesome! Quite the conversationalists, they were both very funny - kept us laughing all while taking care of our luggage and/or providing directions. Whitney was always smiling, knew some hot spots and provided maps to help us get around. Would definitely stay here again!",5.0,5
"NOT SAFE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!
I had a horrible experience at this hotel. First of all they didn't give us the right room because the room we reserved had been damaged by a sprinkler leak, so we got a room with two queen beds instead of one king bed, that was the only good thing about this experience.
In the replacement room the edge of the carpet in the bathroom doorway was shredded and pulled back a bit, leaving exposed tacks with the points sticking straight up. We covered it with a towel and decided we would be fine with it instead of asking for a different room. My four year old daughter ended up slipping on a wet tile after getting out of the tub and sliced herself halfway down her leg on those tacks. Matter of fact, it was room 102, if you get this room and have small children, please don't make my mistake, go get a different room.
On top of that, the doors have no childproofing and can be opened very easily by a small child. We had to move the table in front of the door to be able to sleep without worrying about our daughter going outside if she woke while we were sleeping. Those doors should have a chain lock up out of a child's reach. This is a terrifying danger with the hotel being just off I 30. I will NEVER go to this hotel again just because of this. 
I do have photos to share, but will not be posting them at this time.",1.0,1
"Terrible!!!!!
absolute worst hotel i have ever stayed in! I wouldnt stay here again even if you payed me to. The staff was extremely rude and the shower walls had mold on them. too much noise throughout the hotel! The front desk staff always seemed to busy talking with other staff members who were just hanging out at the front desk. The manager jason was rude and acted like he could care less about less complaints. I guess its just shocking for a manager to be ok with noise in the hallways and mold on the shower walls.",1.0,1
"beyond dissappointing
my wife and daughter stayed at this hotel because it was recommended by a national volleyball tournament. its the worst hotel they've stay in while traveling in four years. rooms are dirty. my wife had to have the sheets changed when she arrived because they were dirty. we had reserved a small refrigerator for the room for my wife's medicine but were informed they didn't have any more although we had one reserved. i don't know which person with the volleball tournament would recommend such a pitiful hotel and location. DO NOT RECOMMEND",1.0,1
"Great location
The hotel was located with a short walk to many restaurants, pubs and clubs. We were able to walk around and sight see. The check in staff were very friendly and the room was clean and nicely furnished. The rooms are small but I was prepared for it as soon as I seen that it was built in the 1920's. 
Now, what wrecked my stay was how noisey the room was. The heating system was so noisey that we had to turn it off and then there was a constant noise in the room all night. The windows dont seem to be double paned as you could hear emergency vehicles constantly outside. And then to top off a horrible nights sleep, housekeeping was very noisey in the morning starting their shifts, shouting back and forth to each other in the corridor. At 8:05, housekeeping knocked at the door as they wanted to come in and clean it for the next arrivals. I was disgusted. How can a 4 star hotel treat thier guests with such cold hospitality. I went to the front desk to express my concerns. I asked if the housekeeping recieves a vacant dirty list and it was confirmed. When I asked why on earth then would housekeeping knock on our doors so early the one agent immediately asked if I had a 'do not disturb sign hung outside the door'. The other agent happily stated that this was their policy so that the rooms could get clean before the afternoon check in but that he would be sure to forward my concerns to his manager. Their was not genuine empathy nor apology. Would never stay there again and would not recommend to stay there.",2.0,2
"Still love the concept, but this property needs to work on execution
I think that the Homewood Suites concept is excellent, especially for traveling families. However, the location and management of this property needs a little attention. Generally speaking, it was a little loud, especially on the front side, where a sports bar is across the street that goes pretty late. After one of our four nights, we didn't get housekeeping services in our room. The fitness facility is a joke, but, fortunately, there is an LA Fitness facility across the street and passes can be purchased. I will probably look elsewhere next time I'm there.",3.0,3
"Run away
After leaving this hotel without staying overnight I mentioned to another visitor at my new hotel where this hotel is located and he started laughing, and I will quote him, ""Oh Man! You were in the hood!"" California Suites was shady to say the least. First entering the hotel requires two keys. One to open the cage that lets you into the main ""compound"" and then next to open your door. First thing I noticed is various individuals lerking in doorways. It was uncomfortable to be watched as you are making your way to your room. Upon entering the room I find right away that I have been lied too. A small microwave and a tiny fridge does NOT equal a kitchenette. We packed food and booked this location specifically so that we would save money by cooking in our room. I could have lived with this but the beds were the breaking point. First I pulled back the blanket to check the beds and the sheets were wrinkled so badly I had no question that they had been slept in. There was also hair on the pillow. When I sat down on the bed it made a distinct ""Boing"" sound. I felt unsafe in this room. When our friends arrived to join us and saw their room they also wanted to leave. They were a family of 5 and were given a small room with one double bed. When they complained they were told that the entire place was booked and that was all they had. Needless to say we sought and found another place to stay. We contacted our booking agent through Kayak and got a full refund. Kayak reports that they will no longer be representing this hotel (according to our representitive). Cheers to Kayak for their excellent customer service.",1.0,1
"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!
I am very disgusted and displeased with the hotel management. I booked the hotel through expedia by mistake while trying to book a different hotel and when speaking to hotel management, they refused to provide a refund when we explained the situation and told them we would not be staying there. It was literally within 5 mins of booking! We asked to speak to someone who had the authority to provide the refund and cancel the transaction and we were given the run around, ""the owners are out of town."" This is customer service at its worse. Rude, unaccommodating, HORRIBLE! DO NO STAY HERE!",1.0,1
"Great room, great location
This hotel is among the best I've stayed at in Washington. The location is exceptional: walking distance to both the White House and Dupont Circle areas, and it's close to a number of good restaurants, particularly those near George Washington U. The room was clean, well-appointed, and very large: it's unusual to have a microwave and refrigerator in a room at a hotel of this quality, and there's a Whole Foods store a block away so one can easily eat breakfast and small meals in room.. The coffee provided was in the form of whole beans that could be freshly ground, and was delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative was the noise; there seemed to be a lot of partying going on at GWU the night we were there. But I'd certainly stay here again and recommend it to friends.",5.0,5
"Cockroach in the hall
I stayed there from July 25th to the 27th 2012 and found a cockroach in the hall. I told the hotel staff on check out and they really weren't interested or surprised in my discovery. They did offer to pay for my lunch which I declined. I would not stay at this hotel again unless I had to.",1.0,1
"Great location & clean
This hotel was great. It served all it's functions, It wasn't luxury but certainly wasn't the opposite either. The staff were all helpful, rooms were clean and fresh towels left everyday. No complaints to be honest, the computers in reception were a bit slow but most hotel computers are nowadays.
Times Square is just down the road from this hotel (literally) yet it was in a reasonably quieter location which was good. 
If I came back to NY, I would definately have no problem coming back here.",4.0,4
"Not bad for the money
We stayed here for one night during the weekend of June 23rd. The hotel is located on the edge of Lincoln Park, walking distance from the zoo, Wrigley Field and transportation. There are several restaurants within walking distance as well. The hotel is very old but seems to be well kept. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We arrived earlier in the morning, several hours before our check-in time. They pre-registered us and allowed us to obtain our parking early so we had a place to park before our room was ready. The room was very tiny will a full size bed, two bed side tables and a flat screen tv on the wall. It had a walk-in closet and a tiny bathroom with a full tub, shower and sink. The door to the bathroom would not open all the way because the toilet was directly behind the door. It did not have the greatest view but we was not there to sit and look out the window. The room was very clean and had enough amenities to accommodate our one night stay. They offer a continental breakfast in the morning with juices, milk, coffee, yogurt, assorted dry cereals, pastries, bagels, and toaster waffles. 
To end, by no means is this a 5 star hotel or even close to a Hilton. Probably closer to a Best Western but much older. The hotel is very old and decor is very outdated but adds a lot of character to the building. If you need a nice clean place to stay for a night or two, this would be a great place. It might get a little cramped if you were staying longer or if you have more then two people.
The price point was on the lower end of the other hotels that we looked at. Just remember that this is Chicago and you get what you pay for. If you have high expectations of getting the royal treatment for very little money, it is probably not going to happen!",3.0,3
"Great Location, Great Staff
Wasn’t sure where to stop when we first pulled up to the hotel. The hotel name/sign was a little difficult to see, and there was no type of signage as to where to stop for the valet. That’s the bad
For the good: Arrived before standard check in time, front desk staff apologized that our room was not ready, the hotel is in a great location and allows for easy walking all through downtown. As soon as the room was ready the front desk called. Very nice corner room, view of the Trump Tower, the river and the Chicago Theater. It was an easy walk to the Sears Tower in one direction and the Navy Pier in the other. We checked out at 10:00am but didn’t need to leave downtown until much later; the staff stored our luggage and kept our car in the valet parking until 3:00 when we left downtown. 
I look forward to staying again when back in Chicago.",4.0,4
"Almost Great! Executive level is getting shoddy!
I was welcomed like never before. Bags were out of the car and on their way to the room in the blink of an eye with smiles all around! 
As with all NYC hotels the rooms are small so expect it. This hotel; shares a pool with the hotel across the street and the gym is what you would expect. Be warned, parking is $51 a day but that is also the going rate in the city. My only complain is that the executive lounge breakfast are almost protein free. Plenty of jams, jellies breads and oatmeal but limited supply of anything even close to a hard boiled egg. I was told that all Sheraton's have changed their lounge menu but that is just not true. The staff in the lounge does all they can to ensure everyone can find a seat and work very hard to ensure you are happy!",4.0,4
"Love Affair With Fairmont is Over
As much as I hate to say it my long time love affair with The Fairmont Olympic is over. I've really loved this beautiful historic hotel since the first time I stayed here, but after my last trip, we are breaking up. I had a room on the 2nd floor facing the street. It was so noisy it was unbearable. I went to the front desk in the morning and left a hand written note personally addressed to the guest relations manager. I left a business card and a cell phone number where I could be contacted. No one bothered to contact me. For my next trip, I'll choose a hotel with more concern for guest satisfaction.
I will say breakfast at the Georgian was delicious and the pool/spa are was fantastic (especially Dennise).",2.0,2
"Good location only positive
I came for a four day stay with my mother. We booked a twin room, weeks prior, to be told when we arrived that they didn't have any. We had to remind them three times that we were meant to be having an extra bed. The bed that came had a very thin mattress and was far too hard to sleep on. 
The bathroom was filthy. Hairs in the shower, blocked sink and bath. We advised twice that the sink was blocked but no one ever came to check it. We actually bought some bleach and cleaned out the bath ourselves. There was a thick layer of dust all over the TV and the chest of drawers. 
This hotel is popular with school groups so if you want to use the computers provided in the lobby you have to wait for a long time. There is no WIFI in the rooms. 
My mother had left something in the taxi on the first day and advised three members of staff at the front desk of this in case the taxi driver came back. On the last day the taxi driver met us to give us back our property and advised that he had come to the hotel and gave our details but was told they couldn't find us on the systems and sent away. 
A lot of the staff behind the desk were unhelpful and rude, although the porters were very polite.
The location of this hotel is great (short walk to central park and Times Square). Despite the location I would not stay here again.",2.0,2
"The sky is falling
I've stayed at the Marriott Quorum several times over the years and it's always been a good experience. However, times have changed. My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights September 21-24. As a Platinum member, we were given a room on the concierge level. Check in went great. Problems started the next morning when we noticed that the shower curtain liner had a strange stain that looked like blood. I called the front desk before we left for the day and requested that it be changed as well as extra towels. I also left a note and few dollars for housekeeping to remind them as well. Upon our arrival late in the evening, we found that neither request was honored, yet the tip was accepted. We called the front desk and someone finally came at 9 pm and changed the liner and brought towels. On Sunday we went to the Cowboys game and arrived late in the afternoon to find that our room wasn't even cleaned! I went down to the front desk to request that our room be cleaned. I was using a free night on Sunday evening and the manager was nice enough to credit my points back. However, I dont think I would stay here again, even if it was free. We also noticed some very large cracks in the ceiling above the windows that we hadn't noticed earlier. It looked like a chunk of drywall was going to fall on our heads. 
Not all was bad - breakfast in the restaurant was very good; and Angie (our server) was a sweetheart. This hotel is in a great location, so its very sad to see it managed so poorly. Hopefully, Marriott can put someone in place to turn things around.",2.0,2
"Don't Do it!!
I should've paid closer attention, when they had me sign a ""no money back for any reason disclosure."" This hotel is the worst I've ever seen in my life. Walking to the room, there were about five trash bags full of trash in the hall, next to the over filled trash can. The ice maker, elevator and soda machine all had out of order signs on them. Once we got into the room, there were stains all over the walls inside the common area and in the bathroom. There was a layer of dust on the top of the headboard and behind it. I put grits in the garbage disposal after cooking and they came up in the bathroom sink! To make things just a little more uncomfortable,walking into the stair well, there was a ROACH on the wall!!!!! After returning to the room, I seen another ROACH in the bathroom!!!! We honestly slept with the lights on all night!!!",1.0,1

I don't usually expect much from hotels and there was no exception this time. The hotel is nice and clean. I loved the bed and the location. Those are the only things I really cared about.

"One of the worst Embassy Suites I have encountered...
Like ice cold water for bathing, poor onsite service and no follow up by local management? then I have a recommendation for you- the Embassy Suites Hotel San Antonio Northwest / I-10! Had to wait to the desk clerk to finish her cell phone call before I could get checked in only to discover there was no hot water in the room. Called down to the front desk and they sent up a their engineer- his diagnosis- ""yep, no hot water- must be a boiler problem."" Waited a few hours, still no hot water. Called back down to the front desk and was told to try again in the morning. 
After explaining the situation at checkout the response back was, ""sorry, we will try better next time."" Finally received a call in late January from the corporate sales manager Iliana C. who offered some Hilton points for my horrible stay. 
45 days later- no Hilton points and had to involve the Hilton corporate office to get the matter resolved.
There are very few hotels that I completely write off for future business- this is one of them. 
Hilton corporate - fix this mess.",1.0,1
"Best choice for Downtown Philadelphia
We stayed in the Le Meridien to attend a meeting in the conference center one block away. As many have written, it is the old YMCA converted in a nice modern hotel. Upon arrival you first see the modern bar and seating areas rather the a row of check-in counters, quite refreshing. The check-in and elevators are not hard to find at all, in contrast to an earlier review. Immediately left upon entrance as the doormen will tell you. Only renovated 2 years ago, everything looks new and modern. 
Check in was pleasant, we received an upgrade to a suite on the 10th floor (2nd and 4th are missing!) with a view of City Hall. The hallways feel a bit like a maze but it is much nicer than the usual straight hallways and no doubt helps reduce noise in the rooms. The bathroom is well appointed, only drawback is a soap/shampoo holder placed on the long wall of the shower instead of under or across from the shower head, providing you the opportunity to hit it and hurt yourself.
The bed is comfortable and you have the opportunity to forgo housekeeping and instead receive Starwood points or a $10 credit for the bar. Make sure to ask at checkout if you choose the former, I'm still waiting for a 2 day housekeeping credit despite asking for confirmation at checkout. 
A nice room feature is a lockbox with an outlet on the inside of the door allowing you to charge your phone/laptop etc while locked away. The furniture is modern and comfortable, the latter often not the case and not so important if you only sleep in the room but if you do some work and don't want to sit at the desk, it does matter.
The restaurant menu was not long, but the food was excellent. Fortunately more hotels are beginning to pay attention to their restaurant menus and Le Meridien has one to make a special visit to. Try the Bouillabaisse, or their signature Hanger Steak Frites. Prices are what you would expect in Philly and for this quality, we did not think it was overpriced in any way.
Staff was pleasant and very helpful in all areas; front desk, housekeeping, bar and restaurant. 
Another nice feature is in the bar/lobby area. Outlets galore, clearly planned this way, e.g. in the bar table itself, so have a drink while working and charging your laptop/phone or just enjoy the beautifully paneled room you are in. 
We have stayed in many (chain) hotels in Downtown Philly, usually for work. This, however, is one you will enjoy as well when out for fun and will be the first choice for our next visit.",5.0,5
"Super 8 Review - Orange park
This hotel was ok. It was very humid inside and the air is just to close to the bed. The room was bearable. They need to clean the carpet better, especially in the corner, the bed was clean, bathroom clean. The tv did not swivel as I needed to. It served the purpose as a last minute resort for me.

Back to the hotel... nice staff, free breakfast (but go get a manhattan bagel!), comfortable bed. Very small rooms but that's okay. It was clean.

The free airport shuttle ideal and the service is very frequent. Plus being to close to the airport makes this the ideal hotel for any traveller.

Cannot say enough good things about the staff. after years of avoiding it I finally joined the the Starwood Preferred Guest programme.
Highly recommend this hotel",5.0,5
"Avoid at all costs
At first glance, the hotel seems nice. We checked into a first floor room, but it didn't feel too safe, so we requested a 2nd or 3rd floor room. The windows looked flimsy, like anyone could just break in, and there were strange people walking around as we looked outside. The front desk was very helpful, though, and changed our room immediately. As we approached the room, we saw a luggage cart with trash from In N Out on it. It sat there for most of the night. The trash can by the elevator was overflowing with trash as well.
Upon entering our room, we felt it was more like a motel then a ""suite."" The room was not very big. There are 2 sections; the bed and a living room, however, it was narrow and felt cramped. The room looked old. As I stepped into the bathroom, I noticed the toilet had hair all over it. Yuck. Called front desk for service, waited 30 min, then called again. Someone came to clean eventually, but left a strong bleach odor in the room. My wife is preganant, which gives her the smelling senses of a hound dog, so she had a headache for about 45 min. As we laid down to rest on the bed, my wife noticed there was an empty lotion bottle next to the bed. I prefer not to think about why it was there... I'm disturbed that housekeeping didn't pick it up. Makes me wonder how clean everything else was. 
The next morning as we headed down to breakfast, I noticed the trash was still overflowing with the same trash items (mostly food). It was still there when we checked out. Breakfast was supposed to have a meat item, however, there was no meat item. You get an egg substitute ""omelet"", toast, bagelsI, cereal, potatoes and waffles. Not bad for a free breakfast, however, you have to make your own waffles, and I spent a good 40 min or so waiting in line to make one. I spilled waffle mix and the woman that came to clean it made huffing noises and gave me really dirty looks. I did say sorry but she just brushed it off. Nice customer service! By the time the waffles were made, it was almost closing time. I rushed over to get juice and the last yogurt. As I was filling up the first shot sized glass of juice, the same lady that cleaned the waffle mix asked me if I was going to gfet more. Yes, I said, because my 4-yr old son would like something to drink. As soon as I had finished filling that second glass, she flipped the off switch, even though there was a little girl behind me waiting. Seriously? How about you give her a chance to get some juice? Didn't we pay for this already?
I will never stay at this motel-style establishment again. I don't know why it's called a suite. False advertising at it's worst. I almost forgot to mention that it is noisy. Don't expect a quiet night's rest.",1.0,1
"Excellent Location for Beale Street
We were so happy to Priceline a hotel next to Beale Street. The DoubleTree is located just 2 blocks from the street full of restaurants and entertainment. The room was a little small and crowded but clean and the bed was very comfortable.

"cool refuge in blinding heat
This is my second time staying at Sofitel, DC. This time I was in Junior Suite Room 819. As usual check in was quick with no issues. Room was very clean and staff fulfilled special request of having a room fan as well as a refrigerator present when we arrived. The staff is always low key, non pushy and easy going. Bed was very firm once I removed the cumbersome featherbed that so many hotels provide these days. I dislike them and always shuck them off lmmediately in favor of what I sleep on at home (sheets and blankets). Room was quiet until last the night when a loud guest took the room above me. Sofitel supplies sound systems with subwoofers which can quickly rumble the walls of adjoining rooms. To me this is a bad decision on their part. Bathroom was clean, but wife did not like that there was no convenient place to apply makeup while sitting down. Sofitel Philadelphia, for example had a table adjacent to bathroom for this purpose. Hotel Bar is quite expensive and staff is often missing for five to ten minutes at a time. Bar is styled in the chic-cool style which does not appeall to me.

"Okay not what it use to be - stayed 2/4/2012
This hotel is in a great spot in Boston Copley square. It is attached to shopping by glass hallway which is great for all types of weather. I did like that they gave us ""connecting"" rooms, we had come in overnight for my daughters 16th birthday so it was great in the sense that the girls could shop (though very expensive shops here) and did not have to go outside, this is a very upscale mall and very safe. The only resturant is Champs - a SPORTS bar - so sick of sports bars - NO nice restuarant attached but plenty in the area. The lounge at this hotel use to be unbelievable, they had some of the best bands - I know four couples who actually booked bands that they had seen from this hotel. It was a very classy upscale place to come as couples but that is gone - sports bar took over most of that floor and wireless cafe for Starbucks coffee drinkers - so sad - NO entertainment -. If traveling on business stay here. If coming with girl friends go somewhere where they are closer to bars/resturants w/music, there's Copley Hotel accross the street, the Lenox not far. Sad - so much gone from the area. The Palm resturant was just gone, the Fairmont Copley restaurant closed for renocvations, Morton's Back Bay closed the week we went for good - you would have to go down to the Sea Port area for that.

The food was iffy and unimpressive, the business center is tiny and you have to pay to use it, etc. etc. etc. The bathroom products are not hypoallergenic.

"Adequate, but pricey
I realize getting any kind of decent room in mid-town for under $250 is difficult, but for $50 more I got a much better room in another hotel during my last stay in NY. Little things (ice machine out of order, bed not real comfortable, noisy a/c that smelled, sub-par TV, housekeeping not thorough) added up. I would have gladly put up with it all if I was paying $200 per night instead of $250. Boutique style was fine for my purposes, and I didn't have real high expectations. Staff was friendly. Hotel location is great. It's an adequate place to crash in the theater district, but not much more.",3.0,3
"Great Hotel, Location, and Value
We stayed at Solito in January 2012. The hotel is a great boutique NYC hotel. The rooms were super clean and average size for NYC. The bathroom is bigger than others we've stayed at in the city and has lots of counter space.
The staff at the hotel made our trip even better. We ate at a couple very nice restaurants during our trip but my favorite meal was at the Spring Natural Cafe the staff recommended. They also helped us get to LGA airport during rush hour by providing helpful tips and calling a car service. Make sure you interact with the front desk staff they will make your trip a better experience. 
We were able to check into our room at noon which was great since we stayed in Midtown the night before. It is always a hassle to come back later to ""move in"" it is little things like this that can make a hotel stay more enjoyable.
The location of the hotel is good. You're a few blocks away from subway stations for many lines so you can get anywhere in Manhattan in about 20 minutes.",5.0,5
"Nice property, but time for an upgrade
Stayed here twice in three months while visiting family, for a total of six nights. It's clean and quiet,but the rooms need an updating in the worst way. It's a very busy property for families and business people. Good value, nice sized rooms, but old furniture can't be masked behind quality bedding and towels. Nice shower, though. Rooms tend to have that antiseptic smell, which while good to see they are clean, tends to permeate the air. Good fitness area, and of course the manager's evening cocktail hour and breakfast buffet make this an outstanding value. Staff is there to please.",3.0,3
"Worst Hotel Ever!!
First off let me say TINA at the Front Desk needs some classes in Customer Service. I have never met some one so RUDE!!! Second staying in this hotel is like being in a episode of COPS!! There were Drug dealers, and prostitutes hanging around outside. Its like The Hotel staff knew what was going on but they choose not to do anything about it!! Never again will I stay here or recommend it to anybody!!!!!",1.0,1
"Good hotel for a short trip!
I stayed here over new years (4 nights) and got a good price from hotwire.com. The hotel was huge, we stayed in the East tower, on the 30th floor in a king size bed room with a great view, and modern interior. The downside was that is was a handicap room, so it was close to the elevator that made quite some noise all thru the day. And the bathroom had no place to put our things (had to put everything on the floor), but they told use about it while we were checking in. Besides that the room had everything,VERY comfortable bed, coffee/tea maker, iron, tv++++ The staff were very friendly and helpful, except from one of the concierge that had a bad attitude. The location is central, right next to Millennium Park, and Michigan Ave! If you´re not a fan of typical touristy big hotel with lots of people, this is not for you.",4.0,4
"Noisy and crowded area
This is right next to the 9/11 site and construction starts early so can't sleep beyond 7 am on Satuday.The rooms are tacky, mostly Ikea like furniture. The service is ok at best. They don't have mobile phone chargers, so make sure you have all the battery life you need.",2.0,2
"Disappointment
I can only unfortunately share similar feelings as my fellow reviewers. Stayed at hotel 2 night which were total disaster. As Silver CC member I was not recognized and not offered any upgrades. Worse - the room was in terrible location at 5th floor, facing noisy street and some A/C unit. All noises from the street life made it impossible to sleep until 3 am and then at 5am morning delivery and clean-up traffic started. I asked for a room change for second night but was not offered an alternative. Unfortunately I chosen breakfast package, which was my mistake. Breakfast is served in adjacent Raffles coffee shop, which has some limited set choice for hotel guests, ridiculous waiting times and rude service. Additional glass of juice is charged extra !
Overall I'm never going back to this place and recommend the same to you all !",1.0,1
"Not up to Marriott Standards
Wife and I used rewards to stay here, it is under renovation to lobby, so it is noisey and dusty. They advertise rooms renovated recently, wall paper was coming off wall in restroom and exaust fan did not work, this was the second room they sent us too, the first one the bathroom floor was full of water, why did not the maid staff let someone know? Whirlpool is closed and who knows for how long for renovations to the exercise room. Beds and linens were good. Rooms just need a bit of sprucing up.",2.0,2
"If you have the money it´s worth it
First of all i´d like to say that this is normally not the kind of hotels we are staying in, but due to a last minute booking the ritz carlton was nearly as cheap as other hotels were so we dicided to enjoy some luxury.
We arrived by car from NY (took us due to traffic about 6 hrs) and were happy when we finally arrived. We didn´t expect such a warm welcome. There were about 4 employees just taking care of our car and luggage. Of course everyone wanted tip, but it was nice anyway. We took valet parking as it was included in our package (first family package). The receptionist was extremly friendly, showed us on a map where everything was located and guided us to the elevator where he wished us a nice stay and sent us to our room. Exiting the elevator i suspected the worst as hearing children crying around in nearly every room. So all family first bookers are in one floor obviously. Normally we should not complain as we booked it too, but our child, me, was 17. But we were lucky, directly next to us was an empty room so we weren´t hit that hard by all the kids playing around in their rooms. 
Arrived in our room we were suprised of the big bathroom with shower and bath tub seperated. Nice! Also the room was quite spacy with a big flat screen TV. Internet was complementary in our package and worked well. Allthough it appeard on our bill. Short talk an it was removed from it.
Cleaning was ok exept for one day. We came back at 3:30 pm and room was still not cleaned. Complementary breakfast was great. But we made the mistake and rushed to the nice looking buffet at our first morning.... bad decission as the waiter brought a 105$ bill. Nice one! We even asked a waiter if this would be the breakfast included for our room and he just sat us to a table, for us the sign to use the buffet. 
Valet parking in this hotel was an interesting experience... When we asked for our car to make a little tour we waited for 15 minutes. Even other clients, who came after us, got their cars. The boss of the valet parking system noticed us waiting for 15 minutes and asked us what was wrong. After that, two wrong cars were brought, when finally (after searching the key by us(!)) we got it.
Checkout was short and simple, getting the car this morning was not a problem at all.
After all i can say, that if you have the money to afford all the stuff (you have to pay for nearly everything) it is worth it as it´s real luxury. If you are saving money for your trip just to get in the hotel you will be disappointed. Also as you are simply not belonging to the other guests. You just get the feeling of beeing treated differently, especially by other guests who think are something special when sleeping in the ritz.",4.0,4
"Best hotel to ensure a pleasant nyc stay
We love this hotel and if we end up somewhere else we always wish we were at the Affinia Dumont (better than the other Affinia's as well). It's convenient but not in a crazy area and very accessible to everywhere--Times Square, Central Park, shopping--and you can get to trendy restaurants within 15 minutes. We visit about 3-4 times a year, and have brought our dog to the hotel as well. Rooms are spacious and mini kitchens make the whole visit a lot more relaxing. 
Do check your bill carefully. I have booked at special rates and then charged differently at check out. Once i proved my rate via my email confirmation they happily adjusted.",5.0,5
"Comfort Away from Home!
Stayed there 4 nights in November. The hotel is quiet, well run, rooms modern and clean, with a handy kitchenette complete with dishes, dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, etc. Breakfast had many choices and while the dining room was small as some have noted, staff quickly cleaned spaces when available and food was plentiful. I never saw them run out of anything or people not being able to find seats.
The concierge had good recommendations for dining, both pre-theater and in a local cafe. I noticed some people commented on the area. No bother for me as a single woman of 65. I've been to much worse areas in my midwestern home town with no problems.
Great location close to Times Square! It really feels like a home away from home.

We are loyal Kimpton fans but continue to be impressed by their efforts to satisfy their customers.
This time it was Christina, the Manager-on-Duty, who made certain we were well taken care of
---problems resolved quickly and with a winning smile! 
We appreciated her professionalism and assurances. The Monaco Baltimore's General Manager, Lee, has done a fine job with his staff and has not forgotten his winning ways in personal exchanges with guests, either!
Of course we look forward to our return; besides the great service the property is gorgeous, as well as historically significant in Baltimore's history---but then again, there are so many Kimptons we have yet to visit!",5.0,5
"higher standards for the standard?
We'd made reservations for three nights on a trip to NYC to attend the Armory show, see a few other related art fairs, and to take in some Chelsea galleries. We usually stay at another hotel in Soho and thought we'd try The Standard - but we fled after one night and will not be going back. 
Where to start? 
First off, our room was just badly designed. The exposed shower leaked onto the carpet in the hallway - we had to build a dyke of towels to contain the water. The toilet room was far away from the bathroom. To get to one side of the bed you had to navigate a maze of furniture, the tv and other obstacles - finally stepping over the bed. You'd think for a hotel built from scratch, it would have been better thought out.
And then there were the trying-way-too-hard hip crowds downstairs when we came back in from dinner. Drunk, loud and rude.
The Standard clearly is not the hotel for us, and now we realize that - but others looking to stay there might take this into consideration before committing. Just wish we had not wasted the night there.",2.0,2
"Not even close to 3 Stars!
Reading these reviews it's almost like these other people were staying at a different hotel than us. At the last minute we had to drive down to San Diego for a family emergency. Having had good luck with Priceline in the past, I picked a 3 Star hotel for $90. A night for two nights and ""won"" The Town & Country Resort. Thinking we had a nice place lined up we set off on our 8 hour drive to San Diego and arrived at 2:30 in the morning to find an unfriendly woman working the front desk. Of course she had no record of our reservation but went ahead and put us in room 3325. 
Upon arriving in our room it was like going back to the 1960's and staying in a cheap motel. The room had 30 year old blue carpet and was furnished from the 40 years ago. Something completely out of a convalescent home for the elderly. Along with the room came 40 years of cigarette smoke. Completely disgusting but at almost 3:00 in the morning it wasn't worth the fight to change rooms. And of course the room above us had the TV on at 3:00AM and made sleeping difficult. At 6:00 AM we found out that our room backed up to the maid's storage room and we had to put up with all there talking and laughing at that time of the morning.
I'm guessing this place was at one time a nice resort but it's apparent they have no money to bring things up to date. I would have expected to pay $39. A night for a place like this. Because we had prepaid Priceline for 2 nights we were stuck. It was so old fashion and dated we brought family members over to see the place we were staying at. Our only bright spot was that for our third night I went back to Priceline and bid $70. On a 3 1/2 Star resort hotel and was able to get the Double Tree by Hilton across the highway, a VERY nice property.
If you plan to bid 3 Star on Priceline beware that you will most likely ""win"" this place. It my opinion this place should only be a 1 or 2 Star hotel.",1.0,1
"Everything's walking distance
I have stayed here a few times. It is convenient to everything. The rooms are well appointed. Last time we got upgraded to a suite which was huge. And, a delightful surprise. The views of the Chrysler building never disappoint. The club lounge has just been refurbished to include a lovely outdoor terrace.",4.0,4
"NOT a good stay!
Where do I begin? First off, my wife and I were given a room on the Northwest corner of the property. The sun was blazing and the outside temp was 114(F). The room AC was off and the room was extremely hot. There was also a unidentified stentch in the room. I turned on the AC to 68 degrees. Two hours later, the room was still hot and still smelled badly. I went to the office to exchange rooms. The young female associate there was very helpfull and gave us a room on the cooler side of the hotel. When we entered the room, the smell of cigarettes burned my sinuses. We went back to the office to get a non-smoking room. The associate told us that was a non-smoking room. She gave us another room. This room still smelled of cigarettes, but, was not as strong a smell. The AC cooled down the room quickly. Upon inspecting the room, we heard a cricket, found it, and killed it. It must have had a friend, which we could not find and kpt chirping all night. The furniture in the room was in bad shape. It looks like they bought it all at a thrift store or used on ebay. The bathroom tub was repainted and the paint was chipping off. All of the furniture had chip marks at the base. The plug beside the TV had way too many plugs used, without the use of a surge protector. A jumble of wires also lay between the bed and nightstand. The bed matress was very uncomfortable and both my wife and I woke up with sore necks. The bathroom was very small and had no way to be cooled. It remained very warm our entire stay. We like to leave the bathrrom light on as a nightlight, but it had a built in timer/motion sensor and kept turning off. The room widows had locks on them. There was no way to open the window. In case of fire, there was only the door; if blocked, would have to throw a chair through the window to get out. The chair in front of the computer desk was a cheap $5.00, straight back, metal framed kitchen chair. The bad smell was in all three rooms we had. The rooms could use a good carpet and curtain cleaning and bed spread change. That might help! The location was not the greatest. Except for a couple truckers, the hotel was mostly deserted that night. 
Positives: 
* The desk associate was friendly and accomodating (moved us twice).
* I could tell the room cleaners try hard to make the rooms nice (folded washcloth into a design, bed made neatly, etc.), but all the surface cleaning and sprays in the world won't remove the smells from those rooms.",1.0,1

"Worst Quality Inn I've ever stayed in....
I reserved and paid in advance for 2 Non-Smoking King Bed Rooms for myself and my wife and a friend. At 10:30am on 3/31/12, we called the hotel and asked if it were possible for us to check-in early (as I had requested when paying for the rooms in Dec. 2011); the representative said we could check-in early, but not until after 1:30pm. When we arrived at the hotel to check-in at 2pm (1-hr prior to their posted check-in time); the front-desk personnel appeared to be unorganized and genuinely unconcerned that the amount of time it took to check guests in (avg of 20 minutes). At any rate; we were checked-in to our rooms. Upon arriving to our respective rooms, both rooms had beds that were unmade, and my room hadn't been cleaned at all. When my friend called the front desk to let them know that the bed wasn't made; she was told that the reason was because, ""check-in time wasn't until 3pm"" and since she had checked in at 2:30pm she would have to wait until cleaning services could ""get"" to her room. After hearing the response my friend got from the ""Manager on Duty"", I went down to the front desk to ask for clarity, because I had a hard time believing that a hotel manager would make such a statement to a guest. As I arrived at the front desk, I heard this same ""manager"" on the phone with someone I presume was another hotel guest, telling them the exact same thing my friend had reported to me. I explained my displeasure t with the fact that neither bed was made, and that my room had not been cleaned at all let alone have the bed made, as well as the comment made by the manager. The front desk person did offer her apologies stating that the Women's Basketball Final Four was in town and they had more guests in the hotel than they expected in a short period of time. She did place us in another room, and offered to find another room for my friend (my friend decided to stay in the original room after the guarantee that the bed would be made immediately, which it was). The 2nd room was clean and the bed was made. However, there were NO towels, hand towels or face towels in the bathroom. So, I called down to the front desk and spoke to the manager who assured me that 2 towel sets would be brought to my room. Well, 
Sunday morning we woke, and were preparing to shower when we noticed that the hotel personnel did not bring the towel sets. This time I went down to the front desk hoping to secure towels only be told that the hotel was ""out of towels"" at the time and they asked me to check back around noon to see if they had towels available. No towels were available at noon, 3pm, or 7pm either for that matter. At this point, we were obviously frustrated. Needless to say; we didn't get towels until Sunday night around 11:30pm!! Other guests shared with us that they too had gone without towels and some without hot water to shower during their stay at this hotel. I stay in Quality Inn Hotels at least twice a month and I have to say that THIS Quality Inn Hotel is severely lacking in customer service and cleanliness. I will never stay in this Quality Inn again and would caution anyone looking to stay here. From this point forth, I will certainly pay the additional $30-$40 per night to stay at any of the other Denver hotels not named Quality Inn!!",1.0,1
"Convenient to Union Station, but the service....
I stayed at the Hotel George recently for one night, as I had flown into DC in the evening and had to catch a morning train leaving from Union Station. the hotel is a lovely art deco style boutique hotel, only a couple of blocks walk to the station. Room was nice and I especially liked the coffee maker with good quality coffee. However, I made phone calls to both housekeeping and room service which both rang out, and I had to try again a couple of times before getting through...was only around 9.30pm so not super late.

"I love this hotel!
This is my 5th stay at this hotel over the last year and I just have to say how much I love this hotel! Honestly, I've wanted to keep this a secret for selfish reasons, but I felt guilty after the EXTRAORDINARY service that I received today. I've always appreciated the very friendly and professional front desk staff, but GABRIEL and LIZANNE went out of their way today. I am on a business trip and decided to stay an extra night in DC, so I made a reservation only 5 minutes before arriving at the hotel. When I arrived, the information hadn't come through, so Gabriel and Lizanne gave me a coupon for a drink at the bar while I waited. During the time I was waiting, the two of them made me feel so welcome that I didn't even care that I had to wait for the room (which, by the way, was no fault of the Palomar, but rather the fault of the online travel agency). They were incredibly friendly and professional and genuinely made me feel that I was a valued patron. In short, they turned what might have been a less-than-pleasant situation into one that will forever endear me to this hotel.
To Gabriel and Lizanne - thanks from the guy in room 807 on the night of March 23rd. You both deserve promotions!",5.0,5

We had a fantastic trip to NYC! The hotel could not be in a better location & the staff were really friendly. The Queen Room that we had was fairly small with not much storage but did the job & was very clean! All in all we had a great stay. We would definately return here & would recommend to friends / family. The facilities such as the business centre with free internet access was a bonus! One of the only negatives is that there are only two lifts meaning you can be waiting a while. We used the stairs but this obviously isn't always possible with cases etc.",4.0,4
"So terrible! - DO NOT STAY HERE
I'm not a very picky person, but this hotel was too much. First, location is in a bad part of town, next to the highway, and we had people asking for money one of the nights as we got back. Second, major construction going on at the time, so at least half the hotel is being torn apart, and not even in sections. Meaning, our room was in between and across from rooms being worked on. There were people constantly coming in and out for the construction, so we did not feel that we or our stuff were safe. Third, when we wanted water, the soda machines weren't working so we just had to drink the tap water, which was terrible. Fourth, our room smelled terrible, like mothballs, and looked like it had gone through a major storm, with leak stains in the ceiling and curtains that were thin and looked decades old. Last (AND WORST), got back to the room one night and found cockroaches all over our stuff. It was late, so we just killed them and tried to sleep, but bugs were crawling over us and biting us that night, so we got the hell out of there. Do not be fooled by the price, it's not worth it!",1.0,1

Frankly for $189+ tax there are a TON of better hotels in SF...Really poor customer service...will NEVER stay at a Sheraton or any other Starwood for that matter...their lack of customer service is appalling....And by the way..the hotel is filthy...smells, stains on the carpet and on the mattress (yes we checked as it was filthy wanted to make sure no bed bugs!)...really truly bad experience",1.0,1

Our booking confirmation came through and clearly said our booking was for $392 plus taxes. The total should have come to about $450 but when I checked my bank statement I saw that i had been charged almost $100 more. I wrote to the hotel and after quite a few days eventually received a reply. it then took numerous emails for them to finally admit that they had charged us extra because they thought we had 4 people in the room. 
we did not book for four people, at no point did any extra people visit the room and we certainly never authorised them to charge the extra money to my account.

"Manager very rude.
I recently stayed at this hotel between November 20 and 23; Booked through Ernst & Young corporate perks. We had called earlier to tell them that we need a crib. When I reached there, the front staff was nice, but when they presented me with charges, those were $15 higher per night than the price I had booked for. When I showed them my booking printout, the girl agreed to change it stating that ""there have been problems with online booking today"". But, the manager came from behind, and started arguing. You would not believe the arguments she gave me. Then, she came down $10. Finally, she gave in. I was aghast. If you do not want to honor the online booking price, please do not allow for it. Then, she pointed towards the crib in the hallway, and said ""that is your crib"". I had to pull it up to my room myself. No other hotel has ever done something like this (maybe this is the norm in Holiday Inn). The room was good, the breakfast was good. In fact, other than the manager, the front staff was very sweet, too. So, if you remove the manager from the equation, it is not a bad hotel.",1.0,1
"Completely misleading. Inn with an attached hotel!
First of all ... to call this place an Inn is a total misnomer. I booked a room here after walking past the Morrison Clark on several trips to the convention center in the past. Normally I stay at the Willard or the Crown Plaza Hamilton when in DC. But this inn looked so charming the last time I walked past it ... I decided to stay there this time and save some money from the normal hotels I was at. It seemed so vintage and cozy from the outside each time I passed it, I couldn't wait to actually stay here.
They should call this the 'Morrison-Clark Inn with a large attached hotel behind it' because MOST of the rooms that are sold at this 'Inn' are actually in the connecting hotel behind it. I felt very misled by the room situation ... I thought all the rooms were actually in the main Inn ... the red brick building you see from the street. In fact this is not the case.
I was given my key and instructed to go to the elevator next to the check in desk. Elevator? Why would I need that? When I looked at my folder, it said I was on a higher floor. Higher floor? The inn only had two stories from the outside. wtf? Surely enough, I stepped into the elevator and went up and it was like I was transported from a charming inn from the late 1800s to a shabby hotel from the 1930s when the doors opened.
My HOTEL room was probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It was smaller than some of the budget hotel rooms I stayed in earlier on in my business career while on a travel budget in NYC. It was smaller than a lot of the older hotel rooms even in Europe I stayed in, which is really saying something. The furnishings were nice enough ... but there seemed to be way too many things in the small space making it hard to walk around the cruise ship sized room.
I opened the windows and the view was terrible. There was a neon lit outside coridor thing next to my room where people could easily see into my room if I didn't close the drapes. My view from a high floor included several other buildings with a very industrial feel. I didn't feel like I was in DC, I felt more like I was in downtown Newark.
The room was dark and the lighting was sparse. There were some small recessed type lights in the molding over the bed, kind of like you'd expect to find on a cruise ship. There was a desk lamp and a table lamp next to the bed. The paint in the room was a darker brown, so it really made the room dark and gloomy. I had NOT expected to be staying in an old tower-type hotel ... so I decided I would go downstairs to the Inn section and have a few drinks to take the sting away from my tiny hotel room.
9:30 p.m. ... bar was closed on a Friday. They suggested I walk a few blocks down the street and go to their 'sister hotel' where they had a bar. You've got to be kidding me.
The Morrison-Clark HOTEL (I will not call this an Inn) is located in a somewhat uncomfortable part of town. It certainly is not a far walk to 14th street and the hussle and bussle of the tourist part of the city during the day. At night ... you might not exactly feel comfortable walking back to the hotel through empty streets with the occasional homeless person. It is in the city across from the Convention Center ... but most everything is closed after dark around it. I certainly wouldn't want to walk through the streets in this area maybe 4-5 blocks from 'civilization' with a family after dark. There is a small (smallest I've ever seen) CVS across the street that stays open later.
To get to the White House/Smithsonian museums is about a 20 minute walk. If you are not familiar with the city, it will take you a couple times to get used to the walk but it is relatively easy to find your way around if you are comfortable reading maps or navigating a grid type of city. Certainly walkable and maybe worth the $50 or so bucks you will save by staying a few blocks outside the action if you are a budget traveler who doesn't want to stay outside the city and take the subway every day.
Perhaps the biggest dissapointment is the fact that I specifically booked this stay vs. my normal places so I could stay at a 'Historic Inn' in DC and I believe this was misrepresented as being a historic inn because most of the rooms are in the connected hotel. For this reason I would never stay here again and tell everyone else the same thing. You will pay $35 for parking and it is valet only, which is ridiculous considering the garage is actually in the basement of the hotel and the valet attendend pretty much drives the car 15 feet to the side of the building and down into the garage.
If you want a cheap place to stay in DC which is a bit out of the way but walkable to the main sites ... this isn't a bad deal. I paid $120 for a Friday in the summer, which in DC was about $80 less than the Crown Plaza Hamilton a few blocks over. But ... be warned ... don't expect to stay in a little inn. It is more like a hotel, unless you are given one of the fewer rooms in the main inn. The standard room is small ... two people would be bumping into each other nevermind a family.
Also, $20 for a small (half the size of a normal one) bottle of wine in the honor bar is crazy, especially when you can't get a glass of wine and sit on the front porch area after 9 p.m. on a Friday.
Again, this hotel should be ashamed for the the way they describe the rooms on the website, making it seem like a quaint inn vs. a semi-run down hotel. Or at least give people the option to choose if they want to stay in the Inn vs. the Hotel section. Also, the check in staff is small (and international) and its not always the service you'd expect from a hotel because they are overextended.",2.0,2
"A top flight property!
We spent three lovely nights at the Westgate and couldn't have been more impressed with this hotel. We booked through an on-line discount site and got an incrediable price. The staff is pleasant and very accomadating. The room was fablous, and the location central to anything you would want to do in San Diego. No pool yet, underway. Stay away from the Valet $30.00 parking as there is plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.",5.0,5
"The King of Nob Hill
My wife and I like to travel whenever we can, so when we were able to attend a conference at the Fairmont in San Francisco we jumped at the chance. We had the best possible experience during our stay there, most likely it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff, facilities and atmosphere were exceptional. The experience started with the staff. Scott was top notch at the Presidents club desk and continued on with all of our interactions with everyone at the hotel. This hotel has found the perfect mix of the old with the new at the Fairmont. You feel like you've gone back in time in the lobby and the meeting rooms, but the rooms have all of the modern conveniences that you would expect in a new hotel. The view from our room in the tower were absolutely incredible. The fitness club was the most fully equipped of any hotel I have ever stayed at. And happy hour at the Tonga room is not to be missed. Add to this, as they say in the real estate business, location, location, location! From the Fairmont you could hop on a cable car or quickly get to all of the major attractions of the city, Chinatown was just blocks from the front door. During an earlier trip to San Francisco my wife and I visited the lobby of the Fairmont and thought if we ever could stay at this hotel we would jump at the chance, but did not think it would be possible. This was truly an experience of a lifetime and we cannot recommend highly enough this hotel for a trip to beautiful San Francisco.",5.0,5
"Nice hotel with good service
We stayed at this hotel in February 2012 while we were showing my husband's out-of-country family Washington DC. The price was great, the service good.

I stayed here for a week long training session. This hotel is great. The staff is very attentive but not uptight in the least. The rooms are well appointed, comfortable and clean.

It is also in great downtown location as long as you don't Seattle's hills.",5.0,5
"Skip this Hotel
I really wanted to give this hotel a superior rating,I really did, but in all honesty, our experience left us with such bad feelings that I will have to advise all travelers to miss this hotel if at all possible! It is a beautiful refurbished hotel that is 98 years old and an integral part of Seattle's history. It is close to almost everything you might want to see or do in Seattle. The breakfast is ok and most of the staff helpful. The BIG problem is the parking, or rather the lack of parking. The hotel has a section of curbing for loading and unloading. The section will accommodate two cars at a time. We were the third vehicle. The hotel has contracted with the Butler Garage two blocks uphill for hotel patron parking. We were issued a key card which we were told had to be returned at checkout or we would pay a $50.00 replacement fee. The key is used for entrance and egress from the parking garage. What we were NOT told is the fee to use the garage is $20.00/day payable upon check-in. The hotel did not bill us for parking and so we headed off to the garage to depart. Only to find out that we could either pay the garage $28.00 a day OR we could walk back to the hotel to pay our $20.00/day parking fees. The manager of the garage was extremely hostile and rude as she apparently thought we were trying to steal parking. When we returned to the hotel, the person who had accepted our key card was no longer on duty and his replacement seemed to share the opinion of the parking lot manager. Fortunately, my husband remembered the card number and upon paying the $20.00 per day, we were released to trudge back up the two blocks, get into our vehicle and depart. My husband has proclaimed this family will NEVER return to Seattle. This could get interesting as our daughter was being recruited by the University of Washington! Seriously though, do yourself a favor and skip this hotel!",2.0,2
"Awesome staff!
I live on the east side of Indiana and I took my daughter and her friend to Indy for a couple nights over school break to go to the Children's Museum and go shopping. I found TownePlace Suites online and booked because it looked well-kept and was reasonably priced. It far exceeded my expectations! What made the biggest impression on me was the front-desk staff. After checking in, they even called a local restaurant for me to find out if they were still open. In this day and age of poor service and rude people, the staff at TownePlace are a shining example of how to treat people right. Will definitely go back!",5.0,5
"Wonderful Staff makes this a wonderful place
We spent four nights at the Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf and the staff made our visit delightful! I have not encountered a more helpful concierge than Pablo Mendenilla.

He knows everything about the city and you can tell he loves his job by his enthusiasm for helping people nonstop!",5.0,5
"Ok....nothing great
My husband and I spent this past weekend at the Ritz for his birthday. We typically stay at the Four Seasons but we decided to give the Ritz a try since we could collect Marriott nights as my husband needs so many nights a year to maintain his platinum status. We were to have a city view room, but instead we faced another brick building with no view whatsoever. We typically receives upgrades due to his status, this did not happen and we did not receive the room we paid and requested with the city view. No apology or a discount on the room. The rooms are large and quiet. The bed was extremely comfortable. The housekeeping service was lacking. We only received one water bottle the entire weekend. We had to keep asking for towels as we were provided with only one bath towel for two people. The housekeeper cleaned the room and then left her dirty rag on the sink, and no toilet paper in the bathroom. It was nothing major that happened but little things like having to ask for toilet paper when you are paying $700/night for a room is a bit ridiculous. The concierge desk was always staffed with 3 people; however they were always on the phone for lengths at a time. Understandable, but after waiting for 10 minutes 4 different times we went to ask for help at the front desk for recommendations. They did acknowledge you but has to continue their conversations. We received wonderful recommendations from the front desk staff, so it wasn't a problem. My husbands joked that to get a hold of the concierge he should go up to the room and call them. We have stayed at the Four Seasons the last few years for my husband’s birthday, they always send up a small cake, card and sometimes a bottle of champagne. The Ritz Carlton- nothing. They did not even acknowledge we were here celebrating his birthday, after this was noted in the reservation and I had called several days before to confirm reservation and mention this. This was disappointing. We ate at the hotel for breakfast as we had a $100 credit to use. If you stuck to the menu the prices were not unreasonable, however if you ordered something that was not on the menu the price was steep. I ordered one egg on the side and it was $14, this was funny as my entire pancake breakfast with pancakes, fruit and a drink was only $20. The location is directly across from Central Park and in an ideal location for walking to various sites. We are returning for another weekend in NYC in 2 weeks. We will be staying at the Four Seasons the next time around.",3.0,3
"Family Visit
We stayed for two nights over Columbus Day Weekend and we were very happy to be back. This is my favorite place to stay in Boston because the accomodations and service are excellent and the hotel is not overwhelmingly large. Boston is a great town to walk around, but if you need a cab downtown or to the theater district, there is always someone to assist at the front door and it is usually under $10 for the ride. We were on the B&B package and had a wonderful breakfast at Eastern Standard which has a warm and lively atmosphere. We can't wait to return to this lovely hotel.",5.0,5
"Comfortable and good location
The best part of this hotel is the location. The hotel is located right off of the main drag....so if you're in Austin to party on 6th street...this would be a good choice.

"Great location - good price.
Don't expect any luxury at all! This is a worn down hotel with a great location in New Yorks - in my opinion - best neighborhood. Placed in The Village and very close to Soho, you'll have great shopping and dining and real New York life at your feet. 
Breakfast is included which is quite rare in New York. It's not much - but you can start the day with some buttered toast and a cup of coffee. The rooms are clean and that is just about all there is to say about them. Don't expect to be charmed. Bathrooms and toilets are shared and fortunately clean.
I've stayed at The Larchmont twice and will probably go again because of the price and the great location. It leaves more money for shopping and experiencing the city.",3.0,3
"A consistently solid venue
I have stayed here and recommended this hotel to several people over the years after a good first experience in 1996. 
Location is very good for exploring - you have subway closeby, as well as usually plenty of taxis. The drugstore across the street is 24h (making up for the partial disappearance of delis). 
Yes, the rooms are not huge, but I find them perfectly acceptable - Manhattan being a crowded island with lots of purchasing power you cannot expect Texas-sized hotel rooms unless you're willing to pay extra... Service staff very helpful without exceptions, got a room despite early checkin and the property was always very clean and well kept.",4.0,4

We had a nice stay, perfect Location for us, Very Friendly helpful staff, Room was clean.Security was seen through out the day and night in parking lots.

This just really surprised me, maybe silly but probably won't stay again because of that.",4.0,4
"Poor Customer Service- Not for Nursing Moms
So, I'm a nursing mom, who needed to store my breastmilk while away from my infant. So, I called a month prior to my trip and reserved a room refrigerator for this purpose. Or so I thought. When I arrived at the hotel at 9:30 pm, they tell me that you can't really ""reserve"" a refrigerator, and that all of the refrigerators are being used. Sorry, they say. You can use the kitchen in the back to store it or ice buckets. Because I was tired, and told that there may be refrigerators in the morning, I checked in. No such luck. It took 24 hours, several phone calls, and threatening to check out for the hotel to get a refrigerator from the store. They didn't even acknowledge that they made a mistake, but blamed it on corporate. If the policy is first come, first served, you should make that clear.
How about the rooms? They were very quiet, and bright. However, there was a bit of shabbiness about them. One of the towels we were given had a two inch tear in it, the sheets were quite rough, and the TV was old. The breakfast was overpriced for what it was: warmed up frozen french toast with green bananas on top. We will stay elsewhere.",2.0,2
"Very nice hotel in great location
The Crowne Plaza is very nice, with great rooms and public spaces and friendly staff.
It is located right on the riverwalk on the south side of the river, adjacent to the Main St. bridge, so you can can easily enjoy the riverwalk and restaurants on the south side of the river, or stroll across the bridge into downtown. Or they have a shuttle that will take you various places. The night views of the lit up city and the blue-lit bridge are gorgeous.
The pool and deck area are really great, either to enjoy alone or to have an event. The in-house breakfast restaurant is small but nice, with a buffet and limited cook to order food. There is a Ruth's Chris inside as well.
My only two complaints are: there should be a hot tub in the pool area, and the fitness center is pretty pitiful for such a nice hotel. A little more space and put in one Universal-type machine, guys.",4.0,4
"Not bad for what I paid for.

"Horrible experience
First of all we got there and they didn't have the room we booked; did not pay us the difference from the room we booked to the cheaper one they gave us. STAFF took forever to address our problem, not KID friendly, pool dirty- and parking wow good luck going somewhere at night time and come back to the hotel to try to find a parking space THAT THEY CHARGE AN ADDITIONAL FEE FOR! (NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR OVERPRICED HOTEL STAY)
We thought by paying more we would get a good deal well this hotel is not the case!!
$400 for a 2 night stay plus horrible customer service and a manager who never returned our call when we submitted the complain is not how you do business- They are giving SHERATON a horrible reputation- I guess they are managed by SHERATON but have their own ""policies"" and undesirable customer service.
Great time in San Diego but a nightmare of a hotel.
Don't ever write reviews but this one was called for, if you can avoid this hotel do it.
(Being a military family and moving from state to state we know about hotels and excellent customer service) 
(Oh yeah no free breakfast either)",1.0,1
"Basic Room - Good Value
The customer service agents at the check-in desk are sweet and friendly.
The room basically feels more like a studio apartment. It's clean, but not fancy.
When it came time for sleeping, as we were on the 7th street side, we had to close all the windows to block out traffic sounds. (Also, there were 4 gunshots fired right across the street side our room the first night at 3:30am. We called 911 to come take a look.) Closed windows were ok because there was an A/C unit in the wall.
Bottom line, it's cheap, it's clean, it's basic. 
I wouldn't recommend trying to get home to this place late at night. It gets shady in this neighborhood. Not that I felt threatened, but I know it's not really safe.
P.S. Forget about the continental breakfast. It's pretty much just cereal. :) And the pool was closed while we were there. It's your basic outdoor pool.",3.0,3

Also the windows are absolutely filthy. Not what you'd expect of a supposed 5 star hotel.",2.0,2
"Nightmare turned better...
I picked this hotel since the conference I was attending was also at this venue When you first walk into the hotel it seems very luxurious with lots of marble, huge ceilings, artwork etc, but my room in Harbor Tower was entirely the opposite. When we got to our room the first thing we noticed was a water stain on the ceiling, a mildew odor, and a very, very wet patch of carpet. We would have been OK with ignoring it if we hadn't had stained sheets when we attempted to get into our bed. The next morning my husband went to the front desk to complain about the wet carpet and he was simply told that there was construction happening on the floor above us and they had overbooked the hotel so there was nothing they could do. The mildew was starting worsen my allergies so the next morning I spoke with the concierge and she was very pleasant. She offered to comp us a night stay in the room as well as offer to send someone up to investigate and clean the patch of carpet, hopefully removing the mildew odor. No one came.
I came down again the next morning and pointed out a few extra things I found wrong in the room including someone else's hair still attached to the hair dryer, a mold/mildew spot in the corner of the bathroom, and the rusting door frame of the bathroom. Thankfully, despite being overbooked, they were at least able to relocate us (although I feel quite bad for the folks that ended up in our room that night). The second room was MUCH better and in Seaport Tower. It actually smelled clean, was clean, had dry carpet and it had a lovely view. With it being a corner room we had 3 windows to enjoy the view with. The remainder of our stay was better and the buffet at Lael's was quite delicious, but during the first 3 days of the stay, quality of the room and the construction noise occurring above the room left something to be desired. 
I am appreciative of the concessions that were made by the hotel in an attempt to right the situation, but despite the high touting of the renovated rooms, I would be hesitant to revisit them for another stay without a business reason to do so.",2.0,2
"Don't stay here
I stayed here for 5 days for a work conference. My boss confirmed three rooms, but when we went to check in they only had us down for two rooms and they were not even ready. About two hours later the rooms were finally available. I could not understand why the room doors were so small. Looked like Wonka doors. The bathroom is tiny. They had no in-room refrigerator, microwave and about 6 electrical outlets. The wifi reception was also horrible. The food in the ballrooms and restaurants were just bland and awful. For the price of these rooms around $260 a night, we were very disappointed.",1.0,1
"It's just not worth the frustrations.
We have reached 1,000,000 points on Hilton. In general they are fine. We stay at this particular one because our company has a deal here. But, we have now decided to never stay again (usually two - three stays per month) because 1) the wifi never works properly. Can't keep a signal and 2) laundry bags are NEVER replaced in the room by housekeeping. Every single time we're here we have to first call and have someone come up with bags (this can take an hour) and then call again for a pickup. Laundry is never returned by 7p. It's always late. So, it's just not worth it to stay here even if these are small inconveniences. There are plenty of places that do get it right. They'll be getting our business from now on. And yes, all of these small problems have been brought to the attention of the front desk managers for the past 5 visits so there's no need for a Hilton rep to now say we should have brought this to their attention. We did. Time and time again.",2.0,2
"Be wary of the charges
I have just stayed at this hotel - nice enough but far from special. The worst thing is no car parking, and the guy on reception was not the most helpful in finding me somewhere. The lift was too small and difficult to use for the one luggage cart. I couldn't find any breakfast. Then the bill. I was charged $3 for the internet - you will be charged if you use or not. The final insult was when I asked if we could stay in the room for an extra hour before leaving for the airport. $50 for an hour! I felt that I was being treated like dirt. There are a lot of hotels out there, and I would avoid this one like the plague. The real bonus were the down-and-outs who live outside the front. They were great people to talk to, and it was fascinating to see them all gather when the free food and clothes hand-outs arrived. Great people. Sad for the girl who got beaten up the night of our stay. The Police sorted it out pretty quickly! Finally - the roof terrace (advertised). Great view, nothing up there but a few tatty chairs.",2.0,2

The not so good...The rooms seem to be getting a little bit tired, just don't seem as fresh as they might. On our last morning, a large picture that was mounted above the bed fell off the wall and landed right where my head would have been. The glass shattered. Fortunately, I was in the shower. The word from management was that the picture had been improperly hung and they were glad no one was hurt. We are hoping that they have done a complete check on all the pictures so there are no repeat performances. I am also looking for some renovations before our next stay.",3.0,3

If you just want a place to flop, go to one of the budget chains next to the airport. For a more luxe, ""Northwesty"" local experience, go to Cedarbrook.

This is a beautifully-crafted hotel with all the amenities: free wi-fi, free continental breakfast (with tons of smoked salmon and artisan cheeses, eggs etc.), nice restaurant and bar, comfy bedding, big and well-equipped workout center.
The rate was reasonable for such an upscale property. We paid $149. Our room was smallish but had a Keurig coffeemaker, large flat-screen, ample work area and storage, nice bathroom, good task lighting and bed. A nice touch is the ""living rooms"" scattered throughout the guest wings.

Just came back from a moms & teen daughter weekend in NY. Took the train from Boston to Penn Station, jumped on the metro up a few spots and came out 1 block from Hampton Inn, super convenient. We arrived early and check out bags as the room wasn't ready. I should have reminded the desk clerk that we had requested a room on a higher floor because when we returned they only had 2nd floor rooms left. We requested to be moved the next day which was a good idea as our view from the window was a low laying roof from next door and some old food, pretty nasty. The next day we were moved to 8 floor, much better view and larger room although the bath was smaller then the 2nd floor. Breakfast had enough variety and was a good cost savings. The weather was very warm for Feb. which allowed us to walk just about everywhere. The other positive was check-out @ noon. This allowed us to walk down to GMA early in the morn. and have plenty of time to pack when we came back. I would stay here again.",4.0,4
"Highly Recommend
Recently stay in Galleria Park and found it to be just lovely. (My husband and I are super particuliar, too). Our room faced the courtyard, (very quite), so no view, but our room (it was small- no problem though) was absolutely spotless, the bed comfy, and we loved the high-end linens. The young staff was delightful and most helpful. It was on the chilly side for our stay, and we loved sitting next to the fireplace, sipping the wine during the complementary Happy Hour. We would have enjoyed that on a hot evening, too!
Another wonderful perk: there is an awesome roof top track!!! If you need a run or a morning (or anytime) walk, go up to the 5th floor and check it out. If you just want to sit with your coffee, there are benches up there, too. You can look down over the city, and enjoy. For a small, boutique hotel, this was such a fun and unexpected surprise!
Finally, the location CANNOT be beat. Be sure to walk a few blocks over and have a meal at le Cafe de la Presse, and/or at Cafe Claude. You will not be disappointed.",5.0,5

The whole resort is on beautiful grounds with a lot of potential to be a luxurious resort. There a few activities that can keep you and your family busy for about 2 or 3 days max. The resort is old and was renovated cheaply only too look good at first glance and in the pictures. The rooms are not clean enough to be satisfactory (hairs in the bathroom, dust webs on lamp shades, dust on bed frame, coffee cup rings on the coffee table) and makes the whole stay uncomfortable. The renovation of the resort was done cheaply and is felt throughout the rooms and suites by having furniture with nicks and cracks and uncomfortable sofa that where the fabric feels part plastic. The room's atmosphere was poor due to bad lighting. There is also the problem of pests; ants in most room. Overall based on the website and the prices I expected a lot more comfort than what the hotel offered. With so many hotel choices and resorts, I will never stay here again.",2.0,2

"Uninspiring
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for five nights at the end of September. First impressions were disappointing. The lobby is dark and has the appearance of a funeral parlour but it was the size of the room that surprised us as it was so small. There really was no room to swing a cat and we had to put one of our suitcases in the bathroom. There was a wardrobe but again it was too small and there were no tea making facilities or even a fridge. We had previously spent three nights in a four star hotel in Boston and it was far superior to this hotel. The view from the window was that of a tenement building opposite which also made the room dark. That said, the room was clean and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was (yes you've guessed it) small but clean with a powerful shower. The hotel does not have dining facilities but there is a restaurant attached. Location is great with the 28th Street subway nearby. We really enjoyed New York and as we didn't spend much time in the hotel it was no big deal.

"Another amazing stay at a Kimpton hotel
I'm a big fan of the Kimpton hotels. Their funky, boutique-y feel is fun and you have to love a place with a free wine hour!
This was my first time at the Topaz; I went on my own for a city weekend and to see some friends. I brought my dog Libby, who was adored by the staff. Front desk supervisor Kelly, Mark and others made our stay wonderful. Everyone had a treat in their pocket, though fussy Lib wasn't always gracious about accepting them.
We had a great room (King) on the 4th floor, which seemed to have a number of other dogs staying. We heard the occasional bark, but nothing too intense. If you're traveling with your dog, the Kimpton chain should be your first choice. Other hotels say they allow dogs, but that's about it: they ""allow"" them. Most have hefty pet fees, rules about crating and other ominous warnings about excess charges for cleaning and the like. Kimpton does none of that nonsense. They are truly dog ""friendly."" Everyone at the Topaz smiled at her as she went by. And a few smiled at me. Kidding! The staff was outstanding. Whoever is doing their training is doing a stellar job.
As for location, it's a block from a Starbucks and beyond that is DuPont Circle. The only caveat with this hotel is the $41 + tax per night parking fee. It's valet and you do get in-and-out privileges, but this adds to the otherwise bargain rates they offer. I found a $119 a night rate on Priceline. You can beat the parking charge if you drive a hybrid, then it's free. Next time I'm renting a Prius!

"Not bad...not great
Typical SpringHill Suites room layout. Loses points for not having an updated HD tv in room. I stayed in the separate ""historic"" Kress building which is connected to the main building, which was a pain because I had to use two spearate elevators every time to go from the lobby to my room. (And the elevators were pretty slow).
Breakfast was okay. Staff were friendly but not overly outgoing. Good location for exploring downtown Memphis.",3.0,3
"Slightly disappointing
This one didn't go well from the beginning. I am a die hard Marriott person, and we picked this hotel for the convenience to Tigers Stadium. The parking garage that is attached to the hotel has nothing to indicate that Courtyard guests should park there. The only sign says ""Public Parking."" We puled up to the valet and asked where the parking was.
The public cannot park above level two in the garage (hotel guests are ""the public""). It took us a while to find the crosswalk to the hotel, which is on level 3 because like the garage itself, it is not marked. Once we found the way to the hotel, we found ourselves in a little indoor shopping area and could not figure out where the lobby of the hotel was (no markings). We asked a store keeper for directions.
The front desk staff was friendly, but it seemed like we were supposed to know about the parking before we got there. The People Mover is in the same building and is convenient, but we had to figure that out for ourselves. I asked the front desk for directions on how to find it, but it seemed like anything else would have been asking too much.
We went to the cafe for dinner. The service was slow and if it wasn't for the female bartender - who was very nice, we may not have been served at all.
The room was nice and clean. But overall, I'm hard pressed to give this hotel any more than rating of 3.",3.0,3

"Bring your own Draino
Comfortable bed, quiet, ample-size room,and easy parking. But less than adequate maintenance. The bathroom sink was almost entirely clogged and it took two days and three calls to the front desk get it partially fixed. After the third call, the front desk clerk told me that I'd be getting a credit for the inconvenience. 
Sure enough, when I got back to the room on third evening of my stay, the ""credit"" was sitting there on the table: It consisted of a letter of apology from General Manager Charlotte Young along with a small pack of M&Ms, a small pack of peanuts, and a sample pack of Axe hair gel. Wow, thanks Charlotte! 
The included breakfast had an ample variety of cereal, yogurt, fruit, various juices, eggs, and so forth. 
The hotel maintenance staff never did entirely unclog the sink, but there is a Home Depot about two blocks away, and they have an ample supply of drain cleaning solutions for those who are inclined to ""do it yourself"".",2.0,2

"Disgusting and infested! Do not stay here!!
My husband and I stayed at the US Grant last week for a conference. I was expecting an old hotel, but I figured that it couldn't be THAT bad since it's part of the AmEx Fine Hotels & Resorts program. Wow, I was wrong.
We were initially brought to room 701 (SPG floor). I noticed some things hanging from the ceiling. I had seem something similar in another TA review, so my husband pulled one down to check it out. I thought it was dust or cobwebs, but it started MOVING. I just uploaded a video to TA that shows the bug crawling out of it's pod. There were several of these on the ceiling over the bed. What's really gross is that we were NOT in the same room as the previous TA reviewer... so this is a widespread problem in the hotel. I showed our video and the moving bug to several people (bell, front desk manager, housekeeping manager, etc.) and no one seemed surprised. We were told that we could be moved to either room 702 or 729 (no upgrade) and that they would consider giving us some extra Starwood points. Umm, we just found larvae in our room... and you're offering extra points?! Unfortunately, all of the hotels in the general area were booked because of the conference, so we were stuck at this disgusting place. After a lot of back-and-forth and 3 hours of wasted time, we went to room 702. We thought that the hotel would do SOMETHING... wine? No. Breakfast? No. Upgrade? No. I even told them that this video was going to end up on TripAdvisor and YouTube asap, but they could not have cared less about the cleanliness or reputation of the hotel. The manager that posts on TripAdvisor was nowhere to be found. Upon check-out, my husband expressed his disgust and they offered to reimburse us for about $90 of incidental charges... which is basically nothing compared to the cost of this hotel.
Unfortunately, this wasn't our only problem with the hotel. Everything is dirty... not just old... but dirty. I have stayed in a lot of historic hotels and this one really should be shut down. Several things in the room were broken: lights, furniture, etc. The hotel is extremely dark, as are the rooms and bathrooms. Even fixing the lights in the bathroom didn't provide adequate lighting for getting ready.
It was also difficult to have the room cleaned. We asked to have the sheets changed, and after 3 days of sleeping on the same sheets, I called housekeeping to bring me the sheets so that I could change them myself. See my attached picture to see the sheets that they provided... they didn't even cover the bed! When I called housekeeping to get another set, it took almost 2 hours at night for them to bring them when we were trying to go to bed. Also, forget about turndown service at this hotel. Turndown service happened twice in the four nights that we stayed at the hotel.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I will never, ever consider staying there again. I plan on sending letters to AmEx FH&R, Starwood, and the conference organization that suggested this hotel. I have never had such a gross experience in a hotel. To make matters worse, the hotel had no interest in making this up to us. Please do yourself a favor and consider any other hotel in the area.
PM me with questions or for more information!",1.0,1

"Holiday Inn Historic Philadelphia
This was our first experience staying at this hotel- I should have read the reviews. There were six of us traveling to Philadelphia on business. Our company setup direct bill. When we arrived the direct bill was not setup. I phoned my office and got them to fax the authorizations again. While we stood there they said they setup the direct bill. I found out the next day.-they had charged our credit and debit cards for the first night's stay and the 25 dollars a day for incidentals. With several calls from our corporate office to the hotel I was told it was corrected and all charges were reversed. This was not true. One of our associates never got the charges reverse even though the hotel said the funds would be corrected within 6 hours. When I went to check out- all of the orgininal charges were still on my card and I was told I had to contact the credit card company to have the hold taken off (funny- my credit card company said the hotel had to do it). On top of that they charge 25.00 per night for parking. My thoughts on this was if they don't want to deal with direct bill- then tell the company up front. I read another review after the fact and another person had the same issue with direct bill. 
The hotel should be ethical- If you say you are going to reverse the charges for the group- then take the hold off their funds. The hotel manager got into a screaming match with one of the people trying to fix this issue blamed everyone, but himself-which in my book is unprofessional. You are in the hospitality business- you should do everything in your power to make it right. Instead to lied to us and did not fix the issues and told us we had to get on a conference call with our accounts to get the issue resolved. You billed us- reverse the charges and fix it in a timely manner. On one positive note: Brian Baily one of the workers( maintenance) was probably the most polite worker in the building- too bad he is not managing the hotel and fixing the problems.",2.0,2

This was our second time to stay at the hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very spacious and clean. Perfect for our needs.

"Outdated... and yes, the water pressure.
This hotel needs to be flattened a rebuilt. I stay at hotels all over the country and I wasn't too happy with my stay here. It does the job, meaning that I can sleep with a roof over my head, however there were just too many things wrong with this place.
The bed seems to be a bed possibly from the 90's. It is probably the most flat bed with no pillow top of extra ""fluff"" to make it comfortable. 
The noise is crazy. Trains and horns at all hours of everyday.
The water pressure is probably the biggest let down. I literally had to cup the water in my hands and throw it at my body to get the soap off. Filling a very small coffee cup with water from the sink faucet took 15 seconds, and yes I counted. In 10 years I haven't had water pressure that bad. 
There are some positives. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel is priced very well. However, if you want a comfortable bed and something better than dripping water, check out another place.",2.0,2
"Convienent location
I stayed here recently for a business convention at the Moscone Center. The hotel is conveniently located near shopping and many restaurants, and is a quick walk to Chinatown and even to Fisherman's Wharf. However, for the price, I expected nicer rooms. The bed was pretty hard and the armchair in the room was very worn. Some days my coffee cups were not replaced. The internet is $15 a night, which I find ridiculous. The bar was nice, but tended to get loud at night and the drinks were very expensive ($12-15/cocktail). The staff was very helpful and there were umbrellas you could borrow when it rained.",3.0,3

"Not worth it, ever. No maid service, for over two days. Not even a towel.
First, I work in travel- the good is seen when this is fact is disclosed at. Check in; Staff are usually on their best behavior, everything's at your fingertips and usually without asking. If you want to see a hotel at its every day functioning, this is not disclosed. 
I was disgusted.
From the start, I was taken aback at the horrible condescension and dispicibable treatment of guests. Walking in, The lobby looks promising, white and black modern decor, clean. You're then met by an unsmiling attendant, who flicks her eyebrow in your direction and walks off into a back room. I had to call out 'I have a reservation'- the process was slow and akmost comical as she checks in another guest at the same time, looking them up and down as she types away at their reservation- 'do you have a phone number?' 
I was placed in a nearly empty hotel in an upstairs ( broken elevators) out of the way room with no working doors to access anywhere close to my room. I had to enter on the other side of the building, go up and back down (hall closed) to access it. 
The room may be renovated but the strong smell of chemical left me feeling nauseous and flushed. This on too of being overcharged a total of 50$ that had been snuck in unbeknownst to me.
Given what I do for a living, I know how demanding guests canbe- I usually force up some complaints for articles that don't usually matter to me but will matter to the more selective clientele, this hotel- , these are just the start, and they flow.

"stay from hell
I would say the hotel is very convenient but the rooms were dirty, when I first got there the bathroom looks like it wasnt even wiped down, then we turned down the sheets and it looked like someone walked all over them, had to wait over and hour to get them changed, then we told them at 4pm that we needed a blanket and another pillow for my daughter and to set up the pull out couch, we returned at 7pm before show to get something and still no pillow or blanket and bed not turned down
we went to 8 show and returned and 1045 to change and guess what the pillow was in the hall against the door on the floor and no blanket and bed still not opened, so we opened bed and called and went to front desk for the third time to tell them and they said it would be about half hour because of shift change, 
we went to juniors and then walked around a little returned at 12:15 and still no blanket or clean pillow
went down stairs and called again said it would be sent right up waited till 2am in the morning, my daughter were cold now my husband was fuming, went downstairs screaming and said he was not leaving until he got a blanke and pillow, manager just kept saying sorry but still did nothing about it put his head down like a moron. security came and when my husband explained the situation they just looked at the manager and said are you kidding me I saw this guy come down numerous times and all of this is over a blanket and pillow get this guy a blanket and pillow NOW.
well we finally got a blanket and pillow not about 245 am in the morning, 
so do not stay there they have check in a 4pm you wait all day to get what you need and then they want you out by 12 and to top it off after paying over 450 dollars for the room they charge you 55 for parking

"Going Downhill Faster than a Cable Car
I've stayed at this particular Ritz Carlton over a dozen times, but hadn't been there in about 7 years. I have anew business matter that will take me to San Francisco every month or so for the next year so was looking forward to staying at the Ritz again.
I stayed there last month and was shocked (I hadn't realized that Marriott bought them and don't know if that is the reason for the changes). When I arrived I was stunned -- they'd just completed a major ""renovation"" of the bar, the restaurant and the main lounge off the entry area.
The ""new"" areas are dreadful -- the main lounge area was a shock -- it's a bizarre mix of disharmonious colors and furniture design that can't be explained. I guess the closest description would be ""Clockwork Orange come to the Ritz."" The bar has a red light glow, the walls are dark charcoal, the chairs look like they were plucked from a Disney ride, the fabrics are in a visual war with each other, and for people who like comfort when they relax for a couple of hours with some friends over drinks, if you like your chairs at rigid 90 degree angles that leave you with back pain, you'll love it. I can't imagine an uglier room, and we spent some time retrying to conceive of a contemporary design concept that could explain what they did. We failed -- no design concept was apparent. 
The new restaurant lives up to the maxim: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The closest visual analogy I could think of was one of those all-you-can-east buffet rooms in a glitzy Las Vegas Hotel. And the old bar, with its comfortable cozy chairs and warm colors has been replaced by something resembling a waiting room in one of those airport club lounges, only most of the latter are more inviting.
For perspective, I am not a big fan of the Ritz Carlton's more classic look of repro American furniture, so it's not as if they replaced something I loved. But this particular Ritz, with its admirable location and nice scale, was a good place, and now its awful. I used to spend hours meeting friends and clients in the discreet old bar and the lounge. During my 5 days I didn't spend a minute -- well, one exception, when I went to the bar adjacent the restaurant for a bar snack, I couldn't find a single thing on the menu that I wanted, and I'll usually go for anything.
Another defect? The room haven't been touched. Yes, they're clean, but they are very dated and boring. What was nice 10-20 years ago is just plain dull.
And the one thing I always intensely disliked at the Ritz -- well, they've kept that -- the staff is intrusive, indiscreet and sometimes just plain aggressive. Somehow, the Ritz is able to find perfectly nice and motivated staff and train them to intrude on the clientele at every opportunity. When you come down in the morning on your way to the entrance to find a taxi, you run a gauntlet of insincerely, robotically programmed staff yelling out your name -- I don't need 6 ""good morning Mr. X"" greetings when I walk 30 yards to the entrance. Whenever I stayed at the Ritz, if it was for a business deal that needed to be kept discreet, I always had my clients check in with fake names to avoid having their names shouted for every passing journalist to hear and leak to the Wall Street Journal.
In short, a good hotel has been ruined. I've booked the Four Seasons for my next trip.",2.0,2

"Mixed experience
I stayed in the Westin Georgetown for one night in connection with my company's holiday party. The front desk staff and concierge could not have been more welcoming and friendly. At $129 (the negotiated room rate for our party) I felt the value was good for the location. The room was nice, but didn't have some things that are important to me - thus the average rating. I missed having a refrigerator. There was a small chair but I would have liked a more significant chair or sofa to relax in. The room was very dark. I realize they are working hard to be ""green"" but I could hardly read with the lighting as it was. The bathroom was great with a soaking tub and rainfall shower (separate). Though it may not work for a family as there was no curtain on the tub and the stall had a glass door - so no privacy if someone else is using the sink or passing through to the toilet. My BIG issue was the valet parking. We checked out at noon, which I understand is a busy time. However, after I handed over my ticket and waited a bit one of the valets came over with two keys and paperwork and asked me if one of the cars was mine (it wasn't). I told him what kind of car I had. A few minutes later the experience was repeated by another valet. Finally someone asked me what kind of car I was waiting for, I told him, and 10 minutes later it was brought to me. Bottom line -- I could easily have slipped out in someone else's much nicer vehicle if I'd been so inclined - SCARY. If you do stay here and drive in, be aware that the hotel is VERY hard to spot.

The furnishings and decor of this hotel are top-notch. The rooms are very comfortable, quiet, and functional, with a great office chair, desk, sofa, and comfortable bed. The Bathroom is nice and clean, great shower and bath amenities. The internet service is excellent, but expensive (though included on executive floor). Breakfast buffet in the lobby is also very good, but expensive - stay on the executive floor for included continental breakfast and snacks. There is a Starbucks open in the lobby open mornings. The restaurant/bar just seems like it isn't really trying - I only ate there once in 10 days.
The self service laundry for this large hotel consisted of only one pair of machines on the 3rd floor. This is really disappointing for a hotel of this caliber. I guess they expect you to have it laundered. Another disappointment was a lack of power outlets on the nightstands - I really dislike moving furniture to access an outlet on the wall to charge my phone.
The neighborhood the hotel is located in isn't that great, although the grounds are well kept and security is ever-present.

"not good enough for a hyatt
My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt in San Fran on a particularly busy weekend for the city (Fleet Week, Air Shows, Blues Festivals, 49ers and America's Cup). A Hyatt should be able to stand up to these events. We knew that the lobby was being renovated but there was a total lack of signage to direct guests where they needed to go and there was no doorman at the makeshift entrance to the hotel to mark the entrance and provide direction. 
The check in process was totally underwhelming. The woman provided no information on the hotel, or the city and was incredibly aloof. 
Initially I thought the room we were in was one of the unrenovated rooms.... turns out it wasn't. Granted the colour scheme was not to my taste but even if it was, it was cheaply finished and already had chips taken out of the veneer of the bedside tables. The bathrooms are not bright enough and the bath so small it was pointless to have one in there at all.
We had arranged for tickets to be sent to hotel prior to our arrival. Obviously we confirmed this was ok prior to the booking to tickets, we then confirmed that they had been received. We then spent two anxious days while concierge attempted to locate them. 
Until this point my husband was pretty positive about the hotel, he then tried to organise a restaurant via the concierge, after that experience he was well over the concierge and the hotel. 
I understand that the city was busy and there were a lot of guests but perhaps additional staff during the turmoil of the renovation might make the guests feel welcomed and satisfied with their stay. 
Even without the renovation our experience was disappointing and I will certainly never stay there again. If you are paying for a fancy hotel you expect a certain level of service, The Hyatt did not deliver on basic elements let alone the inconvenience of the renovation.",2.0,2

The furniture in the room was a bit old and tired and hilariously plugging in the iron proved to be the straw that broke the fuse box's back on a couple of occasions!
1 tip on check in is to double check how much they are going to preauthorise your card for and when you check out make sure they don't charge you again! A little frustrating!

Value was good and I'm not sure if there are comparable options that would be any better, but I was somewhat disappointed.",3.0,3
"Outstanding experience
Our family spent five days at the Fairfield Inn & Suites San Diego Old Town. The hotel was very clean and within walking distance to Old Town. The hotel staff was excellent. Very helpful from the time you check in until your departure. The shuttle service was available to all our destinations, so there was no need to rent a car. Great pool and hot tub in the courtyard. The continental breakfast was well stocked with a nice selection of breakfast items. I am now retired, but have traveled extensively. The service at Fairfield Inn and Suites San Diego Old Town was best by far of any hotel that I have visited.",5.0,5
"accessible room- beware
first of all i ordered a double queen bed fo me my wife and two teenage kids 16-17. showed up to the desk only for them to stick me with a accessible room which means they gave me a room for the handicap. my two teenage kids slept ont the bed with my wife and i slept on the floor.for which i had to or else i would lose a one night stay. the hotel had three football teams there so that's where my pre ordered double queen bed went instead, the first night was chaos,kids running up and down the hallway,no control whats so ever, then we slept only to get awaken by a bliniking and blaring alarm in or room @ 2:00 in the morning,which we all had to evacuate!turns out that kids from the team pulled it! then i had to pay and extra $20.00 to at least 1 night stay on what i originally ordered. beware of accessible rooms! make sure you need accessible(which means handicap) room if you are handicap use it if you have two teenage children and wife don't use it or you will end up on the floor like i did .. good luck was a nightmare for me.",2.0,2
"Thank God For The Fans!
We spent two nights at The Surfer, where there is no air conditioning. The room was small, dingy and very warm. Fortunately there was a fan available, otherwise we would not have been able to stay. In addition, the sliding door screen had a broken lock which took quite a while to repair. The setting is nice, close to the beach which is very active with bikers, runners and skate boarders.",2.0,2
"good location and value, will not disappoint
I was there the weekend of 3 23-5 2012, the overall appearance is quite nice, staff professional and seemed to know all the little details they should (theater distances, airport travel, etc). Check in and out was without hassle ,,I really liked the breakfast buffet,,a little pricey but with really outstanding choices. The room (a King bed) was well appointed, large bathroom and decent desk. The interior was a little nicked up (some paint chips here and there) but overall very comfortable and more quiet than i expected. This is a very good location and seemed to have a lot of international guests. I would definitely stay there again.",4.0,4
"Disappointed, but...
Disappointed because we obviously got one of the rooms that had not been completely renovated, but that's the luck of the draw.
The room itself was clean. The bed was quite comfortable, to the point where I meant to inquire what kind of mattress it was ( and still may). The staff was excellent. We had a problem with the air conditioner and they fixed it while we had gone out for the day.
We didn't care for the location, only because we didn't realize it really is in the heart of Times Square, about a minutes walk from the TKTS booth. This of course is great if you're looking to see a play. The location, being on 47th st., is in the heart of the theater district, so if you want to see plays this is a great location. If Broadway is not your thing, then just remember this is a 
really busy part of the city and is quite crowded most all of the time. My rating of only three is probably a bit harsh. Had we
been in one of the updated rooms I would likely give it a four. That and the fact I didn't realize exactly where the hotel was, so that's my fault. I would not hesitate to recommend the Edison, especially if Broadway is your thing, but I would try to make sure and get one of the refurbished rooms.",3.0,3
"Scared the hell out of me!
If I had had a choice I would have went somewhere else!! The service was good but the room was SCARY! Before I did anything I tore the bed apart to look at what I would be sleeping in. The bed was actually the cleanest part of the room, even though the bed was short sheeted. The rugs was filthy! Did not dare take off my shoes. During the night everytime the furance or heat came on you would have thought a freight train was going through the room!! Woke us up all night!! Even though the furnace kept on going on it was freezing in the room the next morning! Looked at the windows and it was BROKEN! No wonder it was cold. I did take pictures and was going to post them on Facebook. NOT a restful time when I was down there for a medical appointment. I am sorry to say I will never be going to one of your hotels again.",1.0,1
"No Doubting Thomas Road La Quinta Gets The Job Done
An entire world exists between B- and C+. I have spent years of my mundane life in this world, specifically during my time in public schools. I spent 3 nights here recently, where a friendly desk clerk and efficient housekeeper crafted a 79.5% achievement for their establishment, if I've a grader - B-. Big points vanished with the missing amenities (out-of-order snack machine, for example, was the only one available) and grounds keeping ( big orange cones in the cactus garden). Other flaws, that could be remedied easily are worn-down carpeting and older, tube-style televisions. A standard continental breakfast offered nothing original. Perhaps the addition of a local citrus item would add a touch of thoughtfulness? No arguing with waffle makers, powdered eggs, fruit loops and coffee with creamer in those little white plastic tubs that say mini-moos. (Other stuff like muffins and bagel and yogurt are offered.) The swimming pool is pretty small. The outdoor hot tub is good; its tiled and the jets are well-placed. 
 A Circle K and a paved, walking/biking trail known as ""The Greenway,"" lie within super-easy walking distance. The parking situation requires one to walk through a tunnel, and around an elevator, staircases and landscaping to get to a room. The small goldfish pond had no fish or visible life other than algae and appeared half-full (I'm being optimistic here, get it?) We chose this location for its proximity to the friends and relatives we visited. 
 For 50-odd bucks you'll find some decent stretch-out area in a double-bed room. The bathroom provides ample space, has nice light (not those dial-timed sunlamps that always made me wonder why motel bathrooms needed to be equipped with them), a large, clean mirror and standard tub. Problem is, VERY LOW WATER PRESSURE and a faucet that would be one level below a Rubiks Cube, in terms of successfully operating. A note on the shower wall (!) explains how to use it.. something to do with radio dials; don't ask. Not to mention, the water took awhile to heat up.
 Yet, looking at the bright side.. friendly, efficient lobby staff and housekeepers allowed us to enjoy our stay! Although, for sixty bones, I could see myself shopping for something a little more exciting next time.",3.0,3
"Nice stay with few complaints
I don't know if we'd pay full price, but it was nice for the holiday Visit Indy sale of $79 total. Large Dance team being loud and taking up most of the room, but mostly quiet during sleep hours. Most families taking full advantage of the free food and drinks. I liked the looks of the indoor/outdoor pool, although small! My few complaints are the popcorn and soda should run till 11pm for people that do dinner outside of the hotel. The interstate noise was slight...will probably ask for a room on the other side next time to see if it is better. Nice touch of the dispensers in the shower, but my husband found hairs wrapped up in 2 of the shower towels. That was kinda disgusting, but I don't think it will deter us from coming again.",4.0,4
"Terrible Place to Stay
We were treated so rudely by the staff. When we arrived the people who rode in the shuttle with us checked right in. When we asked to check in they said it would be an hour. We waited for an hour and they gave us a room right next to the elevator. It went Ding, Ding, Ding all night long. We tried to get moved but the answer was no. That seemed to be the answer to everything we asked for - no, no, no. Housekeeping was atrocious. The bathtub was filthy and they did not clean it the whole 6 days we were there. There was long strands of bright red hair all over the bathtub. They also never cleaned the coffee maker, ice bucket, or sink. The second to the last day of our stay, they never left any washcloths - not a one. The carpet was filthy and the room smelled. There was people partying all night and the rooms were extremely noisy. As far as the free shuttle, well it only runs 3 times a day and if that is not in your schedule then you are out of luck. Worst hotel I have stayed in.",1.0,1
"Overall a nice hotel, but some things were annoying.
Great location, although it's on the edge of the seedy scene (granted that's pretty inevitable for a big-city downtown). Easy walk to Horton Plaza, downtown clubs, ballpark, etc. Room was very nice, we slept well! Food and cocktails at Saltbox were very good. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. 
The annoying things: the sliding bathroom door did not provide privacy when closed; the overhead shower looks cool, but would work better for someone closer to 7' tall; you need to put some printed information in the rooms to describe where things are, hours, etc., the tv menu could be improved to provide this. The layout of the whole place is a bit confusing and I didn't see anything in the room that explains emergency egress. More signage needed everywhere -- what if the power goes out?",3.0,3
"THE 'HELLEVATORS!""
The building is not a traditional Embassy Suites build. It's a cylindrical design. The rooms are good. The service is fine. The location is great. There is no pool. The free breakfast is fine. They use the TGI Friday's restaurant on the second floor. So what's the problem? The place has three VERY small elevators and no service elevator. Be prepared to wait a while when it comes to the elevators. Since they're small, they fill up fast. Plus, the staff members are using the same elevator to go from floor to floor. On top of this, you end up stopping a lot for nobody since there doesn't seem to be a system to let one elevator know it's picked someone up. IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE ELEVATORS, YOU'RE FINE. BEWARE! THE ELEVATORS ARE TERRIBLE! Oh, and for the first day, one of the elevators was not working. One more problem: no self parking. So you end up spending a lot of $ on the valet parking. An added bonus is that Hilton is one of the only hotel companies that still charges for WiFi in your room. We went to an Econolodge on the way down to our vacation and they had free WiFi.",2.0,2
"A very pleasant surprise!
My husband and I did a lot of research on hotels for our 1st anniversary we were going to be spending in San Diego. We wanted a hotel directly on the beach (not the bay) that was comfortable and well kept. There are a lot of old beach hotels what were well…let’s just say not well kept. There were some very positive reviews here and some very negative ones. We decided to take the chance and book the hotel and we couldn’t have made a better choice!
The lobby was clean and welcoming and they have fresh cookies and lemon water available. It was a little busy checking in but the two girls were handling it very well. When we booked the hotel we booked a king with a partial ocean view. When we checked in we were given an upgrade to a full ocean view which was a total surprise!!!The hotel is literally right on the ocean. Hotel, sidewalk, beach. It took about 35 seconds to get from our room on the third floor to the sand. We were in room 362 and the room was just what we were looking for. Not very luxurious and did show some age but honestly it had a world class view and a nice comfy bed. Waking up and seeing the dolphins playing in the surf was awesome! Who cares if the wallpaper is peeling a little because of the ocean air or if the patio door had a couple of rust spots. It was clean and didn’t have an odor or wet carpets like some other complained about. 
There is a $17 parking charge but honestly I can’t even remember the last time I wasn’t charged a parking fee at a hotel. You are able to park in the secure parking garage for the price or risk being on the street or public parking and coming back late and not having a spot. It was worth it for us. There is a small little café in the lobby and there are a few local restaurants that will deliver to your room and the menus were provided for you.
This hotel was perfect for our anniversary and very close to most of the San Diego attractions. Pacific Beach is a wonderful area of San Diego and don't hesitate when thinking about booking this hotel!!!!",5.0,5
"Horrible
I decided to stay at the W Hotel Dallas because the interior of the hotel looked awesome and it was in a perfect location! When we first arrived the front desk staff made us seem unwelcomed and it was very uninviting. I had previously spoken with concierge about special arrangements I wanted for the proposal that I had planned for my fiancé. After check-in that’s when everything started going downhill. First I was not put on the floor that was arranged, and upon getting into the room I found mold in the mini-fridge under the drinks on the door. We called down to the front to explain the problems we had and spoke to Lauren. She had a VERY bad attitude and after explaining our situation she ""sighed"" and said ""I guess I can move you to the same room type on the 14th floor."" Bellhop knocked on the door gave us the keys and walked away. There was no apology and after running to the hall to catch him to show him the mold he still had nothing to say except “I will let front desk know” and walked away. We finally made it to the 14th floor and opened the door to a smaller downgraded room. We were fed up with this hotel by now so I had my fiancé call her friends and they went out for the evening while I went to the Dallas galleria to pick a few things up. When I got back it was already night time and I went to turn the lights on and to my surprise the only light in the whole room was in the restroom!! There was NO lamp on the desk, no lamp by the window and the light between the two beds had no bulb! I called the front desk and Lauren answered again with the same attitude and said ""really"" as if I was lying. So that same bellhop came up and said ""moving again?!."" By this time my fiancé and her friends just walked off the elevator and they saw I was trying to figure this out so now my proposal was ruined. They moved us to a suite that we ORIGINALLY booked and never had. At this point we went out for the evening and came back to sleep. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone! HORRIBLE STAFF AND UNSANITARY ROOMS!!",1.0,1
"Horrible - fortunately, it was only for a night
The room looked decent until we went into the bathroom and noticed the shower curtain was missing. We tried contacting the staff, but there was no phone service. We went to the front desk to ask for the curtain, and the employee was extremely rude and literally ignored us. Half an hour later, we asked again, and it took them 2 hours to bring it to us. The bedding was stained and there were hair and dust balls on it. This, added to the noise of cars and planes, made sleeping an impossible task.
The room next door wasn't much better either. My friends had to stay there with ants crawling on the floor.
There wasn't much to eat for breakfast, and the area was so small that if there were many people, you had to wait for a long 15-20 mins before getting your food.
I only stayed there for a night, and I'm sure I'll stay away from Comfort Inn for the rest of my life. It really shouldn't be called 'Comfort' Inn.",1.0,1
"Better than most HIE - Recently rennovated
I was here 1 night for business. The hotel has been recently upgraded and provides good value compared to other similar type properties.
Just a few miles outside of downtown Boston right off of 93 (on the south side). Convenient to Boston and Logan airport. the hotel is right near a shopping center that has an applebees and an Olive garden as well as a target and best buy.
The hotel has free parking and free internet that is faster/more reliable than a lot of hotels I have stayed at. The room was on the small side but I would say normal size for boston (I had a 1 bed queen room).
My room was quiet with power outlets near the bed and at the desk. There was a nice flat screen TV with tons of channels (including HD), a fridge, microwave and a workdesk/chair. The bathroom is small but plenty of hot water. The bed was comfortable but like most HIE the pillows were small (a minor convenience). The linens/towels were clean and in good shape and in general the entire hotel was very clean.
The front desk was staff was very nice/pleasant.",4.0,4
"Very disappointing!
Our initial room had a super noisy AC unit that clicked and whistled. At first they refused to move us and were pretty rude about it but after continued discussions they eventually moved us to a normal room. 
Next was the worst part, the valet said to pay him for self park and he would put it to our account. I paid him and we parked the car. When we left there was no record of the payment. The Valet Manager and Front Desk mangers both were defensive, combative and offered no refund.
I've stayed at hotels around the world and of course including some Hyatts and I've never run into a problem were the managerial staff was so rude and unwilling to even try and be helpful. On top of that they basically right off the bat accused me of lying about the whole thing. It was nuts!
I was not crazy angry or anything when I approached them, it even took me a second to realize that this was not just a discussion but an actual aggressive confrontation. I was just not expecting that the managers to come off so accusatory and combative.
Terrible customer service by any standard, we won't ever be back which is no loss to us because Indy has many good hotels right downtown.",1.0,1
"Fine for a quick stay
Stayed here for 2 nights to attend a show and chose the location because it was half way betweed Red Rocks and the Airport. It's close enough to the freeway that it didn't seem to be too far away from anywhere and there was always plenty of parking even when we got back late. 
The staff were great which was lucky as we had a smilar issue as a previous reviewer with our room lock not working and wasted a fair bit of time with Security trying to 'break in' for us and then having to relocate. 
Buffet breakfast was pretty good - waffles were great and there was plenty of fresh fruit to add to them. Would probably try somewhere else if we were staying in town longer.",3.0,3
"The room was a disappointment.
My wife and I were given an upgrade to an executive suite, but it was very disappointing. The bathroom was very very small, possibly the smallest i have ever seen in a hotel other than in Japan. A lot of space was wasted in having a lobby/vestibule that had a small wardrobe and suitcase stand. The bedroom had a very large bed but other than two small bedside tables there was no space for anything else.The living area had a desk unit with one cupboard and three drawers and apart from the small wardrobe in the vestibule that was the only storage. There was very little free surface area so with one person at the desk there was no other working area. Even the coffee machine was placed on the window ledge behind the sofa which meant you had to kneel on the soft to make the coffee. Prior to asking for and getting an additional table I had to resort to kneeling on the floor in the bedroom with my computer on the bedroom window ledge when my wife was working at the desk.
There was no easily accessable power socket in the bedroom so you had to ask for an extension cable if you wished to have power at the bedside table. 
I had read another review about the bell service and when we arrived, it was very late, there was no bell staff available to assist. I did start to ferry our luggage into lobby when one of the parking valet staff came to the rescue with a cart. He explained it was not his job but was happy to assist, while we were checking in a bellman did appear so he helped us to get to the room.
The Club Lounge breakfast was OK but it was very busy and difficult to find a seat. With everyone using their computers for Skype calls it did resemble a MacDonald's restaurant.",2.0,2
"A Great Place to Stay with a Friendly and Helpful Staff
We were extremely pleased and very impressed with the professional, courteous and helpful service provided by the hotel staff. From our arrival through our departure, Michael at the front desk could not have been more friendly or helpful in assisting us (first time visitors to Chicago) find our way around the city. Our room was comfortable, neat and clean. The top floor pool and exercise room were a real plus, and the views from the rooftop garden were spectacular. All in all, it was a most enjoyable stay thanks primarily to a staff that could not have been nicer or more helpful.",5.0,5

"Worst place to stay! Doesn't deserve any stars!
I arrived at this hotel late evening, tired due to flight delays. It was a business trip. I was given a room on the 4th floor that overlooked the back of other buildings and a flat roof of another part of the hotel. Furthermore, the room smelled bad. This was after asking for a decent room with a view. Upon telling them that it was impossible to sleep or stay in that smelly room, I was told that I would have to pay an extra $35 for a room with a view. I preferred to pay that amount than get sick! Upon speaking with colleagues from my company who were also staying at the same hotel and in rooms with views of Chicago and the Lake, I found out that they were not paying extra for it. When I confronted the front desk they decided to take it off my charge. But this was not all. I discovered while still at the hotel that an expensive piece of antique silver jewellry was stolen from my suitcase. Upon complaining to security, the Director of Security at the hotel had the nerve to tell me, and I quote ""that it was possible that the person who cleaned the room may not have stolen the jewellry and that it was possible that I may not have had it with me""! This was the final straw. I contacted Consumer Affairs and I was told that they would get back to me in 3-4 days. This was on Nov 15th. Today is the 29th and I have not heard back from them. The total indifference, lack of tact etc. shows this company should NOT be in the hospitality business. Next time you find something of yours missing while staying in this chain, know that it could have been stolen by one of their staff! I am totally disappointed and will not be staying at another Hyatt if I can help it!!",1.0,1
"no pool, no wifi
overall hotel was nice, but considering the price, being just nice is definitely not enough. there a lot more better places for the same price. it was surprising that that they decided to reconstruct pool in summer:((definitely bad decision) and another big surprise was that there is no wifi access until u pay, not even in the lobby. for any access to the computer u had to pay, even to print a paper. that seems to be really cheap :)
also location was not that convenient as I thought it would be, it seemed to be in the center, but there was no place I didn't had get a cab, most of the interesting stuff are pretty far.
DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND",2.0,2

The windows in our room were broken and did not stay shut, although we were on the second floor this was unsafe and noisy. There were no screens in the windows either.

The springs could be felt through the mattress and the pillows were covered with dirty pillow cases. Very disappointing.",2.0,2

"Quite a pleasant experience, only 1 major complaint
My friends and I visited DC to tour a couple colleges we are considering for our masters. We were on a tight budget, and this hotel was just what we needed. Previous reviews mentioned ""no frills"" and that's true--no continental breakfast or anything special. But it's next door to Burger King, a nice Italian place, there is a Subway on the corner and a Starbucks next to the Metro stop, which is conveniently located only 2 blocks away. I was pleasantly surprised with a nice clean bathroom stocked with plenty of towels and soaps, comfortable beds, free coffee in the morning and a nice big flat screen TV. 
My only complaint was when I called to make the reservation, I was quoted 20 dollars for parking. I even double checked that it was for the whole weekend, but when we arrived, we found out that it was 20 dollars *per night* with a expensive tax that made it almost 50 dollars for the weekend. As I mentioned earlier, we were on a very tight budget, and that last minute expense was quite an inconvenience as we had to cut out a couple other things just to afford to park our car.
Other than that, we had a very nice weekend at Days Inn on Connecticut Ave.",4.0,4
"Good location, average hotel
me and another chaperone took 5 17 year old student to NYC for a week in June for Journalism workshops on Columbia. We chose this location because of it's access to the subways lines to go to Columbia or downtown to the sites. We LOVED the location of the hotel. We were 2 blocks from central park, 2 blocks from the subway and 1 block from an amazing grocery store. The area felt less touristy and more like a home to people who actually live in the city. We walked by schools and daycares, grocery stores and dr offices. This is the first time in 3 years (and 4 trips to NYC) that I have seen an area this ""laid back"" and residential. We were within 10 minutes from Columbia and 10 minutes from Times Square. We chose this hotel also because we could get a room that fit 5 people. One of our rooms (that I was in with the 4 girls) had 2 queen beds in the room, and a pull out sofa. My students said the beds were comfortable, but the sofa may have been some of the worst sleep I've ever had. The room wasn't cleaned thoroughly. The tub got a little grungier every day. We constantly had to call down for towels. Front desk staff wasn't overly helpful. It was nice that there was a breakfast buffet - definitly saved us money. And the price was great. Considering how little time we spent in the hotel, I wasn't too picky. If I had been able to sleep as well as my students, I have rated it higher. For the price, this hotel is worth while. But it's just an average hotel.",3.0,3
"Quiet rooms, nice views
I stayed here for a couple nights for business. Overall, this is a good hotel near the Navy Pier and a short walking distance to Michigan Avenue shopping. 
The lobby is extremely small and loud (due to the bar), but the rooms were quiet. The hotel is right next to the lake, so over half the rooms have great views of the lake and pier.
The room was a good size for downtown, but the bathroom was a bit small. I had a small problem with my bath tub stopper and it was immediately repaired (I even received a call to check that everything was taken care of to my satisfaction). Restaurant and bellman service was just average though.
Overall, an acceptable choice for lodging if you need to be in the general area.",3.0,3
"Not your typical Fairfield Inn
This is not your typical Fairfield Inn architecture. This is 10 floor building with an underground parking garage. I don't know if this was built to be a Fairfield Inn or converted to one. The customer service was typical of a Marriott propertry--very good. That, however, couldn't save this place.
I had a room on the 10th floor. It was spooky. The 10th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid 50's. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink. Ice machines are located on floors 9, 7, and 5, however all of them were out of order. Ice was available in the lobby. 
The door from the garage to the hotel was un-locked at all times. See a previous review about the door being ""broken"". The garage itself seemed dirty and dingy. 
Sound insulation is non-existent. There was a surprising amount of road noise given I was on the 10th floor.
Overall the place looks run down. It isn't dirty, but certainly not as clean as other Fairfield Inns. In fairness, the price was very cheap.
My reccomendation to you is to check out the Courtyard Inn about 1/2 mile north on the same road. My reccomendation to Marriott is a.) close the 10th floor and do a complete re-model, or take your good name off this property!",2.0,2

We did check in our room and there it was! But this trip we needed a tub :(. So i had to go to the front desk and ask for a different room. She was so nice and gave us another room right away. We went to eat and came back, was going to go on my computer and realized it was still in the other room!!!! Went back to the desk explaned to her what has happened, she was so kind! gave me a key to our old room walked in got my laptop and went right back and gave her the key back!

"Not that great
I don't know why everybody is raving about this hotel. We spent one night here in July and were really disappointed. The room was dark with old furniture and lacked any charme. I was aware that one could not open the windows since I read about it on tripadvisor. But having experienced it in person, I can only recommend to change that state, since our room was smelly and I would have given anything for some fresh air. The only truly positive thing I can say about this hotel is the fact, that it is located right in the middle of downtown, which is a plus since many sights, shops and restaurants are within walking distance.

You can't beat the Wilshire Motel if you want a great west side location.Could have a very good rating if updated.

They also have larger rooms as well. I paid $95 in June. They had a smoking room for $85 which I declined. The rates include, taxes/internet/free parking and continental breakfast. You walk into your room right from the parking lot, which is very busy, and the owner, Julia, really acts like a traffic cop to make sure people can get in and out. From your room, you have easy walk to resturants, food shopping, cvs, etc. it is really good, and easy acces to the freeways. The breakfast is in a converted room and equal to the top chain motels or better. You can book right with the motel direct there is no cut rate deals just good prices. I would have given it a very good rating if the rooms have been updated. If you do not plan to spend much time in the room this is a great choice.",3.0,3

My friend and I only stayed here one night, as SF was a pit stop before heading off to Wine Country. Customer service at The Orchard was fantastic and the location is great! There is a trolley line that runs past the hotel and the hotel is located within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, shopping...
The hotel was very clean, however, I can't say it was quiet, but our room was located next to the elevator and maid closet- big mistake! 
Valet is $40 per day with in and out privileges. 
I would stay here again!",4.0,4
"Good NYC choice
I've stayed at many hotels in NYC, the Alex represents good value in comparison with most in a similar (and some in higher) price bands and I now use it regularly
Good :
-rooms are the best feature - very spacious and well equipped, including a small kitchen, large fridge, microwave etc
-in-room facilities good (quality TV, iron etc), bedlinen good quality, room not noisy (although get a high room if you can)
-decor (inc bathrooms) in good shape (ie not 'tired')
-well situated at 45th and Third, 5 mins walk to Grand Central Station, 15 to Central Park
-small but well equipped gym that doesn't get busy
-nice informal bar with good staff and a short but tasty menu
-good breakfast (not buffet style and all cooked to order)
Could be improved :
-WiFi is fast but expensive at $15/24 hours
Otherwise a good central choice for anyone visiting the City",4.0,4
"We left after 30 mins!!! Shockingly bad!
Had one of the worst experiences of my travelling life here. Do not stay there!
We booked quiet last minute on Hotwire.com so didn't know what we were getting til it was confirmed. We had expected a 3star room for two, what we got was a 2star(or lower) shabby room with two small twin beds. 
As we checked in the queue was huge but this was around 3pm so check in time so not really surprised or put out by that. The lobby area is lovely and the reception staff were friendly enough... it was when we got to our room that it all went very down hill. 
The room was very dated, scuffs on the wall and curtains that didn't close(there was a basic blind behind the net curtain that barely blacked out the room. The street noise was very loud and we were located by the lifts on the third floor. 
The constant bell ringng of the lift as it hit our floor (in the short time we were there) confirmed that this room would be way too noisy without sleeping tablets and ear plugs! We read through the hotel manual and it mentions to use the door chain on the door and not open the door unless there is confirmation of identity which rang our alarm bells. Then we saw that the door chain was hanging on as if it had been busted before... then as we started to unpack we realised the room didn't have a personal safe, I have never stayed in any room that didn't have a safe and frankly having to go down to reception with all our belongings to store is not professional or very reassuring. Then looking online we saw several reports of theft from this hotel...
We sat there not sure what to do, we spent £300+ on two nights here and had plans for the evening so time was short. We decided to stay and give it a go. I used the toilet only to discover the bowl was filthy and the bathroom grotty. then my partner pointed out a cigarette burn on the bed throw (this room was nonsmoking...) I felt itchy at the thought of what other oversights they had made... at this we decided that there was no way we could stay here. We went online and booked another hotel at top price for the rest of our holiday. We knew we were going to have to just write off the money as there is no refunds on our booking. We returned to reception and told them we were going to check out. When we told them why we were leaving they were surprised and I mentioned the cigarette burn. I was informed that a refund was not possible which I told them I was aware of and hadn't expected we would get one. There was no offer of a different room(not that we would have stayed at this stage. 
The location is not desirable and very dodgy(I have been to San Fran before and we had been in the city for four days prior to our brief stay here so knew the city fairly well by the time we checked in). There were so many hobos outside and in the area(something we were used to as this is highly visable in central SF but this was a much higher level and quiet scary). Frankly if you have no valubales and don't mind slumming it you may be ok. I'm sure there are other nicer rooms here but 3star rating is a bloody joke. we wasted our money and it almost ruined our holiday. 
If you haven't guessed I WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN(EVEN FOR ANOTHER 30 MINS...)",1.0,1
"Why stay anywhere else for the Boston Marathon
I can't say enough about all the staff at this property. They genuinely care and are very committed to provide satisfaction and a quality stay. The location of this property is second to none and if your visit happens to be centered around the marathon, the access to to the buses and the return from the finish can't be beat. Subway to the anywhere in the city is just steps away, although everything one might need is close by this property. Walk out the front doors and join the Freedom Trail or spend a lazy afternoon in Boston Common or the Public Gardens.",5.0,5
"Extremely Impressed
I had not even heard about this particular hotel chain. I was impressed on the level of customer service since the minute I made my reservation. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful, hotel is very clean, updated and with great charm and ambiance. Free breakfast, happy hour and cookies at night are a nice touch. Perfectly located in Downtown Denver within walking distance of great restaurants and 16th street Mall. Loved it and will definitely be staying there in the future!",5.0,5
"Impressive lobby
The lobby and the entire building are impressive. The wait at the elevators that some described seems mostly solved (staid on floor 21 and only experienced a minute or more of waiting on very few occassions). The standard rooms are small and don't have too many thrills (no mini bar, no coffee maker, no armchair or corner to sit for a cozy reading moment).
It seems they make an effort to keep the fittings in the rooms close to what it was back in time and that is nice, especially since they seem to be well kept and well functional.
The service is accurate but not overwelming. In fact I had somewhat contradicting experience, I forgot my shaving stuff and on a call to the concierge asking where to get something like this a razor and shaving foam arrived at my room within minutes, nothing showed on the bill, great service. When I tried to get hold of a beer to drink in my room after a late night working session there was no chance to get one, not so great service.
I have the impression that for the same amount of money one can get a little more space somewhere close by. Though one might stay in a place with less history.",3.0,3
"They ripped us off and won't refund the money!
I arrived there late and didn't read the receipt until I got home and they had charged me two extra days I hadn't stayed there. When I called the lady was rude and wouldn't refund the money. Not to mention I could hardly understand her and she used profanity. Why would I want to stay there for more than one day, the floors looked like they hadn't been vacuumed for a week, and between the uncomfortable bed and the noise I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Do not stay here, this is your warning please take it!",1.0,1
"Perfect location, very nice room

"Run down, HOT in summer, outdated
This is the WORST hotel I have EVER stayed in!!!!!! The air conditioning (if you can even call it that) is pitiful!!!!!! We were only there two days, thankfully. We had to call the front desk each day to have the ""engineer"" lower the air conditioning. The A.C. only goes to 65, but it feels like it's about 75-80. When it's 95 degrees & humind outside, air conditioning is a MUST! We had to change rooms 3 times just to get a room with halfway decent (not cold) air conditioning. It's awful! The hallways are dirty and run down. The ice machines are on every OTHER floor, how ridiculous! I made the mistake of staying here because I was able to use SPG points and pay $45 a night combined. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!! The ""doormen"" are pretty much useless. The bell captain and staff were at least nice and helpful. There's a reason this hotel is so much cheaper than the others in the area. AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!",1.0,1
"Good location, noisy in room aircon
Good location - we had a 2x double looking into the atrium, the aircon unit is in the room and sounds like a jet taking off when it starts up, so was annoying - it was ok - wifi not free - slam dunk bar was great for afternoon drinks and dinner - easy walking distance to the mall and all the sites - prob better hotels in Washington and would try another if I went back but it was still ok",3.0,3
"Exceptional service at a unique property
I was in Austin for one night for work, and chose the Driskill on the recommendation of a colleague. Service was exceptional, the room - though small - was beautiful and unique. I know they have larger rooms, and next time, I might pay a bit more to see what their larger rooms are like, but the room I had more than met my needs for a quick business trip. All around, very highly recommended.",5.0,5
"Good, not great
The hotel is fine. But for the price and the four-star rating, I expected more. The staff is friendly. The place is clean, but shows wear. Our room was not huge but sufficient, the beds and pillows are outstanding and I do appreciate the noon check out. The location is great.

It was very sketchy, unsafe, and unclean.",2.0,2
"Check your credit card for extra charges!!
We stayed in this hotel in August 2012 during our trip around the US and the hotel was by far the worst we've stayed in. We bought our tickets relatively late and Western Inn was the only hotel that was available and close to attractions for the time we were planning to be in LA. We booked a hotel room through the Best Western chain website. The same exact room had two price options - breakfast rate and regular (no breakfast). We booked the one with breakfast as we stayed with my parents and I thought it'd be more convenient for us to eat breakfast at the hotel. The total was $1258.89 for 4 nights. After we checked in and went to our room I checked my account and found out that my card had been charged additional $400 something. I went downstairs to find out what it was for but they couldn't give me a clear answer and kept saying that it was a first night charge deposit. Then I asked them about breakfast and they said that they didn't do breakfasts anymore! I told them that our rate was supposed to include breakfast as claimed on the website. They were trying to convince me that I was wrong, acted very arrogant and rude. I told them I had a conformation email and only after I brought my laptop down and showed the actual email, they got surprised and told me to come back later. 
Later in the evening they offered us breakfast vouchers to eat at a tiny restaurant on the first floor. We went there next morning and it was not a continental breakfast as claimed on the website, but something you order from the menu (omelett or pancakes only). 
These experiences made us want to get out of this hotel as soon as possible; thankfully, there were plenty other good options around that were much much better and CHEAPER (Holiday Inn is right next to it and it was way cheaper. breakfast was great and our room was spacious and clean, unlike the one at Best Western).
Also, when we decided to check out earlier, they said the initial charge of $400 something was for the first night, even though our reservation email said $314 (including taxes). Their response was that the email calculates the AVERAGE, but the actual nightly rates are different.",1.0,1
"Old and run down
I stayed at the hotel for one night for a work appointment the next morning. I arrived at the hotel late on a weekday night. The room I was given was one floor below the lobby level and all the way in the back of the hotel. The room looked like it had not been upgraded since the 1980s. Everything was old and worn - the bed, couch, carpet, window covering, windows, TV and even the door. I kid you not. The only thing that was half decent was the bathroom counter which was newer and spacious. 
I tried to salvage my stay with breakfast the next morning. I went to have breakfast at 8:30 a.m. and there was nothing left to eat. All signs of eggs or any meat were gone and were not going to be refilled. All was left was cold cereal. 
If I were you, I would spend a few bucks more and stay to at a decent hotel.",2.0,2
"Don't Do It !
You may be tempted to stay here due to their cheap price, but believe me....you will be sorry! We arrived at the motel later than expected, anticipating our cruise the next day out of Baltimore. As soon as we drove up we knew it would not be good news. The area looked ""iffy"". Then...we walked into the lobby and that was horrible. You know you're NOT in a safe area when there is a glass window between you and the motel employee. I asked for our money back, being willing to take our chances of finding a nicer hotel but they said no, there would be no refund. Thus, we felt obligated to stay. The manager on duty said she would give us a complimentary upgrade to their ""deluxe suite""....oh brother......it was absolutely awful ! We did stay there but it was incredibly out dated, the toilet had a crack in the seat w/some of the paint peeled off, the room was HOT, even w/the ac going, the furniture was old, old, old. And...just to give you a better visual, on both the left and right side of the toilet there were toilet paper holders....tacky! Never again! We were nervous our entire time away on the cruise if our car would be safe or even there upon our arrival. It was, and we were thankful for that but when we got off we called as instructed and waited nearly an hour for a ride to the motel to pick up our car. Oh, also...they should have some kind of registration for the shuttle. There were far more people wanting the shuttle than there was room in the van so many had to wait. 
My advice....stay somewhere else and enjoy your vacation.
p.s. the breakfast was in a hole in the basement and consisted of cold cereal and white bread!",1.0,1
"Great stay, great location
This was fifth hotel I stayed at with my wife on our honeymoon-roadtrip and it was definitely a nice hotel, we had a great view of Philly and the room was large and luxurious. We were in Philly for Independence Day so it was an interesting stay. Only minor complaints.
Presentation (4/5)
Overall the room was excellent, very luxurious and clean. I wasn't a huge fan of the shower, but that is minor. One thing I found weird was while the lobby and rooms were air conditioned, the hallways of the hotel were not. This isn't a big deal, but a bit strange when exiting the hotel you go from cold, to hot, to cold, to hot again (outside). I understand that this is probably to save energy, so I guess it's OK. 
Service (4/5)
The service was good at the Omni, none of the staff were overly friendly but they weren't necessarily rude either. 
Room Service/Dining (N/A)
We didn't eat in the hotel, we only stayed one night and didn't really have the time.
Location (5/5)
The location of the Omni couldn't be better, right outside independence hall. We had a view of the park and the water, very nice. We also got to see fourth of July fireworks in our room, great location.",4.0,4
"Charming boutique in Lakeview
This is a small hotel, not like the chain ones but more like staying in someone's home. Very friendly and helpful staff. Charming atmosphere. Comfortable beds. Breakfast is included, but they should get some splenda for the coffee, and fresh fruit would be a plus. The bathroom light was fluorescent and flickered so hard to put makeup on. The bus downtown is a block away. Wrigley field is a comfortable walk. There are lots of restaurants in the area. We felt safe and comfortable, and will stay here again when we're visiting Wrigleyville/Lakeview.",4.0,4
"Shop around before you settle!
We booked online but our reservations were completely messed up. Staff is not customer-service oriented. 
On weekends the hotel is dominated by weddings. You would think the staff would be able to handle this but instead they use off-duty cops who treat noise complaints like drug busts. Seriously, thrown to the ground to be handcuffed in you own room! 
Before you book an event, be sure and have all expenses spelled out and reviewed beforehand. There are many hidden fees and over-charges.

My wife and I have boy and girl twins who turned 4 years yesterday. We wanted to do something very special for them, so we decided to take them to NY to see Mary Poppins on Broadway.
After we secured tickets on ebay (great 5th row orchestra seats at a super price), we went through American Express to get the special. 
Decided to email the W to let them know how special this trip meant for us.
Patrick Armano replied that he will make sure it was special and wished us a safe trip up there.
First, he gave us a better upgrade than AMEX gave us and the room was INCREDIBLY decorated in a theme of Mary Poppins, that our children were excited and the look on their face....PRICELESS!

We rented two rooms, one for 4 nights and one for 5 nights. - We were there for our son's graduation from MCRD and we wanted a hotel that was close to the recruiting center and not out of sight in price. - And we got it all and more! - The staff was great and very helpful in every way. It was an easy, quick drive from the hotel to MCRD and also to the airport - The staff helped us find wonderful restaurants right in the area. - The rooms were clean and good sized and the bed was soooo comfortable! - The wireless internet worked wonderful.

"My go-to Hotel for Harvard and Hospital Guests
I am an event organizer for a number of programs associated with Harvard and the associated teaching hospitals (Brigham and Women's, Children's, etc.) and have been working with the Best Western Inn at Longwood for years. The group sales staff at the hotel have been nothing short of helpful, courteous and amenable over the years as I have contacted them with accommodation requests for guest lodging for groups ranging from just a few rooms to large multi-day and week room blocks. The hotel itself is located in a highly accessible area of the city with proximity to Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Conference Center Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, Best Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Fenway Park, the Museum of Fine Arts and many other Boston landmarks.

"Very nice hotel
I booked this hotel on hotwire, and directly afterward i came here to read the reviews. Truth be told, i was a bit wary after reading the reviews, but when we got to the hotel we were quite pleasantly suprised.When we went to check in, there was no wait at all. and then after checking in the desk lady offered to upgrade our room if we became a FREE member, which took all of two minutes. The rooms were very clean, very nice. The bedding was completely amazing. I would kill for one of their pillows. The location of this hotel is obviously awesome. The view out of our room was of the canal, and at night the view was killer. Also, the bathroom was a bit tight, but it wasn't bad at all. We also did get room service, and it was quite quick. The mahi-mahi was delicious, but it was a bit pricey. Also, beware of the minibar, if you lift any of the items, you are automatically charged for the item. My man accidentally picked up a 6 dollar bottle of water (which with taxes and charges ended up being 9 dollars). I would highly recommend this hotel.",5.0,5
"Perfect stay again!
We stayed here 3 years ago and it was awesome, so I had high expectations for our recent trip. The hotel and service exceeded all my expectations and has even improved in the new spa facilities. This hotel is perfect for families, as they have a rooftop pool, junior suites that are partitioned with sofa sleepers and a day bed on one side, and king bed on the other, The Burger Joint in the lobby, and even cartoons playing on the elevator TVs! Icing on the cake for us was the razor scooters for the kids to ride in Central Park. The location can't be beat, and the service is incredible. I highly recommend Le Parker Meridien for any traveler who is looking for a comfortable stay in a great location at the right price!",5.0,5

The location was wonderful and morning staff was great but the evening staff was not very helpful. The room need it's carpet cleaned.

We had problems with our toilet and they checked on it but we had to fiddle with it all weekend long. Also not having a simple toaster in the room's kitchen was disappointing. For the cost of the room and the high cost of the valet, you would think that the internet would be included but guess what...there was a charge for that also.

We had Club level which was nice in the am for breakfast. and it included a Starbucks machine that makes mochas, lattes etc. The staff in the Club lounge was so sweet. They were the best part of this experience. Parking was very expensive so be ready for that. For our 3 nights it came to almost $200.00 with taxes. The room service was fast, but horrible.

"Pricey But Good Service
On company business, during a very crazy tme (Hurricane Sandy was about to hit the East Coast), I stayed at the Omni Chicago 4 days. The good things: the room was spacious and the view vey nice. Although they don't give you a refrigerator and microwave, you can request one. I like to eat different food (and left overs) at odd times and this convenience is a necessity for me. Housekeeping kept the place immaculate. They brought water at night and check on you for any needs. I love the turn down service. Selecting coffee for the morning is a very nice touch. Free WIFI in the room with Omni membership is good as it is not so convenient to have to get internet access in the hotel lobby area. Front desk, doormen and conceierge were all excelent in their service and response to requests. The conceirge will print your boarding pass for you and he gave helpful tips. He also arranged airport shuttle service for me. The location of the hotel is in a good area of Chicago (safe), convenient to the Water Tower, shopping and famous popcorn. The downsides: I like to work on my laptop in the bedroom and I could not find a decent connection in the bedroom area to plug in my laptop, cell phone and IPAD. I actually had to use a plug way up in the closet fo get an outlet I could use. A power strip would have been helpful as I couldn't even get to the outlets that had the clock and lamps plugged in by the hotel, they were way behind the bed I believe. The tub was stopped up with slow drainage but they did send someone to fix it at my request. Oddly I found the bathrooms on the lobby floor had plumbing problems too (3 of 4 stalls had backed up toilets) so maybe it is just the plumbing in the hotel is old? The lobby is okay but I didn't find it as comfy for business travellers. For example, if you want to drink coffee and snack while waiting for people, there aren't enough mini tables and seating if with a large group. The chairs must be old and need touch up, I got a splinter from just moving one chair around and it took a day to dig that out of my hand, ouch! For the price of the hotel, the chain name, I was expecting more elegance and business convenience for the lobby lounge area. I think overall the service responses to requests made up for things but I know some hotel guests would find it annoying to have to even make requests. Some hotel chains normally have the front desk call your room after check in to find out if anything else is needed but since I do speak up, that wasn't necessary.",4.0,4

"The Customer is King and so is the Dog!
My husband, dog(Shelby), and I have stayed at this Hotel Monaco twice and the one in Portland once. We joined their Kimpton Hotel loyalty plan and have been treated like treasured guests ever since. Their stated goal is to be the ""most loved"" hotel company and they have certainly endeared themselves to us. On this trip their dedication to top-notch customer service was evident even before we arrived. We were staying downtown to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had reserved an upgraded room online, but then worried later that it might not be one of their dog-friendly rooms. I called to make certain it was all okay and spoke to a really nice woman (wish I'd gotten her name) who assured me that there are dog-friendly rooms of each kind and that our reservation was all in order. She noted that we are members of the Kimpton In-Touch program and that we were going to be there for a special occasion. She asked if we would like to have a bottle of wine or champagne in the room. I stammered a bit and said that actually we are micro-brewed beer hounds. She said she would see what she could do. So, we arrived downtown around 1pm and thought we'd see if they would let us leave our car there while we went to eat lunch and wait for our room to be ready. We were delighted to find out that our room was already available and we could unload the car. The valet was very sweet to our dog and helped us juggle the luggage, dog, jackets, keys, etc. Inside they have an adorable chalkboard with the names of all the dog guests posted. They also give you a little gift bag with dog treats, a dog toy, and clean-up bags. The lobby has a lot of seating areas, a fireplace, chess set, and complimentary wine around 5ish. I'm not sure what the decorating scheme would be called, but it's warm and comfortable as opposed to a lot of the trendy places with hard surfaces and mod colors. Our room was decorated in a similar fashion to the lobby and included a sofa, lounge chair and desk with desk chair. There was also a bed on the floor for our dog. The bed for the humans was huge and had crisp linens and lots of pillows. The bathroom was a nice size and instead of those little bottles of shampoo and such they had large dispenser bottles in the shower. Probably better for the environment. After dropping our things we went out to explore the city. The hotel is in a great central location and you can leave your car there and walk all over the place. When we came back a couple of hours later there were three bottles of Pike Place Brewery ales chilling in a bucket of ice. There was also a personalized card written to my husband wishing him a happy 56th birthday. It was signed by the Chief Concierge, Jesse Peterson. Too cool! The next day we had a really delicious brunch at the adjoining restaurant, Sazerac. After we returned home I filled out an online questionnaire and gave them high marks for making us feel so special while we were at the hotel. I then received a 'thank you' email from the Director of Operations and it wasn't a form letter! These people are SERIOUS about customer service. I have recently slacked-off on writing reviews because it's time consuming and I feel a little bit like ""why would anyone care what I think"", but when a company puts so much time and effort into making sure I'm happy I'm glad to talk about them to anyone who will listen.",5.0,5
"Better options for less unless you need a kitchen
The hotel is right across from Philly’s gorgeous City Hall. That’s pretty much all I can say for it. The lobby has extremely low ceilings, and feels dark and musty. The second floor bar area is much more what you would expect from a lobby. Our corner room had one of the weirdest layouts I’ve ever seen, with a small kitchenette and living room, tiny sleeping area, and oddly configured bathroom. The room was straight out of 1995, and the furniture showed it. Wifi was fast and free. As for the breakfast, it only is offered til 10a.m. on the weekends, so by the time we got up and down there, we were out of luck. I’ve never seen a hotel where breakfast stops at 10 on the weekend before.
The hotel was very crowded and boisterous, and I could see staying there if you needed a kitchenette for some reason. Otherwise, the Courtyard next door -- which was the same price -- looked much nicer. Other hotels are in the nicer Rittenhouse Square area for the same or less.",2.0,2

"Worst Comfort Suites Ever
My husband and I stayed at this Comfort Suites while in Jacksonville for a medical visit. The hotel was dirty and the staff was not helpful. One day our room was not serviced, even though we were gone all day. We did not have the Do Not Disturb sign hanging on the door. When we returned, the bathroom had not been cleaned and the bed that not been made. The fitted sheets did not even fit the matress and kept coming off during the night. My husband went down to the front desk to complain and get fresh towels. The desk clerk said he was not surprised about our complaint and said we would be lucky to have our bed made and clean linens in the same day! The clerk indicated that management did not care if customers complained or not. They would not be doing anything about it. When we returned home, my husband called and complained to the priority club company. We have not received any communication from the hotel.",1.0,1
"Not my choice
My extensive group was assigned this hotel during our stay in Indianapolis. Several rooms did not have hot water in their showers, but had hot water in the sink. Several in my group were told that we could not get more towels ...they were out. Only 2 sets of towels were in each room except for washcloths which was only one per room. Most of the rooms in my group contained 4 people. The hotel was aware of this prior to our check in date and had not provided without having to be asked, and when asked, did not want to provide quickly or kindly...depending on who was working the front desk. Sheila was very helpful to my group. In my room, the very nice looking marble counter top in the bathroom had a large crack in it --a portion of the counter by the sink could easily be moved. I did not try to remove it. Above the bathroom mirror the ceiling was flaking and cracked. The fan in the bathroom did not work. Only one sleep number bed control worked and the other bed's control did not have numbers- just light dashes. The alarm clock provided by the hotel sitting on the table between the beds did not work. In searching for an outlet by the beds to plug up our phones we discovered the outlet behind that table as a hole in the wall with a sock or small towel stuck in it. We did not remove to find out which it was. Upon returning to our room, the beds had been made, but the garbage in a bag was left on the TV table--all garbage cans had new bags in them. On a bright note, the air conditioner kept the room nicely cool. We did not go to or use pool or spa. I do not know how to clear the ranking on those 2.",2.0,2
"Poor customer service...
We arrived at Hotel Mela after a 9-hour flight and were told that they were ""overbooked"" for the night in the category of room we had reserved and paid for (King). We were told that we would be placed in a ""standard"" room (full) and moved the next day. We were disappointed, but know that errors some times occur and said okay. 
 However, we thought it was reasonable to ask that they credit us the difference in the amount of the costs of the rooms. They said that this was not their policy! They said because we booked through Hotels.com they could not refund the amount. We asked that they reduce the next night's rate to reflect the difference, but they also refused this request. The bottom line is that we paid for accommodations that we didn't receive, and management refused to provide a means to rectify the situation. 
The hotel itself was satisfactory. However, the stay was soured by the lack of simple equity - it is reasonable to pay for the room you received (not the one you booked and didn't get).",2.0,2
"Nice stay at St. Regis San Fran
My husband and I spent three lovely nights at the St. Regis during our recent trip to San Francisco over the fourth of July. The hotel is located within walking distance to the Ferry Building (15 min), Union Square, and the downtown area (10 min). The bar in the lobby has well-made cocktails (try the muddled cucumber martini) and a nice, relaxing atmosphere for happy hour. Because many restaurants were closed on the fourth of July, we opted to dine at their restaurant, Ame, which was open, Surprisingly, the food was excellent, the service was very knowledgeable and attentive and, after dinner and wine, we had an easy walk back to our room. The room was clean and reminiscent of other St. Regis we have stayed at-great bathtub (I always look forward to taking baths at St. Regis hotels, but I can not say that about other hotels I have stayed at). The rooms are a nice comfort to return to after a day of waking, shopping or eating. Because we were jet lagged, we did not make it to breakfast, but there are plenty of breakfast options outside the hotel. The valet parking at $50/day seemed excessive, but we had a car and wanted to use it daily; therefore we paid for the valet parking. There are public parking lots a few blocks away from the hotel that charge about half what the St. Regis charges. The building must be old...when my husband showered in the morning, it took him about 15 minutes of running the hot water tap before hot water actually flowed in the shower. The sink faucet and baths were hot immediately; so it was a little surprising and frustrating that the shower was not immediately hot, Generally, we enjoyed our stay and, when we return to SF, we will consider staying there again,",4.0,4
"Great location but needs updating
The courtyard is in a great location for being in the downtown area. You are within easy walking distance to all the major attractions and places to eat. The people mover is also readily accessible to get around if you do not want to walk.
The rooms on the other hand are getting very dated. Our room was upgraded during our stay and was in poor shape. The bathroom had drywall that was peeling due to water damage and the tub would not drain. Climate control in the room was not working. The system shuts down the cooling feature this time of year ""as stated on the control panel"". The only way to cool the room was to open the window. This is not conveinent due to having to leave the drapes open and letting the noise and light in from outside.
With some updating, the hotel would be worth the price. Currently though there are other hotels in the area that are nicer and you can get them for the same price or cheaper.",3.0,3
"Not impressed...
We stayded there for 3 nights.
Location is actually really good, room and toilet size are good as well.
But rooms are not extremely clean, in fact, they are not very clean.
Our room was located very far from the elevator and so wasn't very practical as it involved a long hallway walk.
Service was ok and they did gave us a complimentary ticket for 1 day breakfast, that was nice.
Overall I would say it pretends to be a 4 star hotel but it is a 3 star with a fancy dress.",3.0,3
"Wonderful Hotel, Excellent Staff
We chose The Amalfi based on the TripAdvisor reviews. We are so happy that we did. Our first trip to Chicago May 9-12. We arrived by train and walked to the hotel, arriving around 1 pm. and we're able to check in right away. The young lady who helped us was very pleasant, gave us some water, discussed our plans and made some calls for us. We were on the 4th floor across the street from Harry Carys. We did hear a few sirens but it is a big city and it was not enough to keep us awake or spoil our vist. The room was nicely decorated with a large bathroom. Comfy robes and nice amenities. The breakfast was amazing...juices, fruit, bagels, pastries, yogurt, coffee, tea and everything replenished as the morning went on.
One of the best things was the Happy Hour each evening. We met some very nice people from San Francisco, the Netherlands and Austrailia. It was fun to talk over our day and hear what other guests were doing while they were visiting.
This hotel is an a perfect location, the staff were all friendly and helpful. We have already recommended it to friends and on our next visit we will be staying here for sure.",5.0,5

The location is perfect, right by the Marina overlooking the water. Upon checkin, the staff was friendly, the grounds were tidy and the rooms are updated and clean. Room service was prompt, the attendant was friendly and the food was pretty delish. The only reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars is because the fitness center is slightly outdated. The weight machines were a bit under oiled and stuck from time to time. The tv on the bike machine didn't work, but that's ok. The main tv was fully operational. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this hotel for a business stay or vacation with the family.",4.0,4
"Exceeded our Expectations, Great Location
We just stayed for one night, breaking up a trip from CT to NC. The hotel is easy off, easy on for I-95, a prime reason we stopped here. We were surprised to find a 12 story hotel with a fine restaurant and lots of ammenities, including a dinner theater (which we'll try next time). The rooms are comfortable, clean and everything in good repair. Nothing fancy and not too spacious, but good value, with a microwave and refrigerator. Check-in staff were very friendly and provided written directions to nearby Ft. McHenry National Monument, our planned stop the next morning,as well as recommendations for other nice things in the area and encouraged us to use the free shuttle to the Inner Harbor area. We wish that we had more time to take them up on the Inner Harbor excursion, but are already planning a return stay at this quality, well managed property. The restaurant was quite good, with a nice layout, good menu choices and very reasonable prices. Be sure and try the creamed crab soup! Free breakfast the next morning was in the same comfortable restaurant, so much nicer than most hotel breakfast rooms. Fresh cooked eggs and sausauges,not the packaged kind and pseudo meat found sometimes, There was also a waffle maker and fresh fruit. All in all, this hotel is excellent value and gets A++ for hospitality.",5.0,5
"Very nice but not great for weekend stays
Had very high expectations for a high end hotel. Concierges were friendly and helpful with tour and restaurant recommendations, but the rest of the staff seemed cold and relatively stiff. The room was lovely with a great view (used plenty of points to get this location) but the area's coffee shops and casual breakfast type locations are closed over the weekend. No coffee maker in the room so a hot beverage required a trip outside the building (except for a few hours in the morning when free coffee was available in the lobby). Would pick another Starwood hotel in a more lively area if visiting the city again.",4.0,4
"I was scammed.
I stayed here for two nights. On the second night my phone was stolen from my room. I had a very expensive pair of headphones also that were stolen from my room that same night also. I paid over $1,100 a night for the deluxe sweet and I was treated like complete garbage. The roof top bar was very nice till two weeks after i checked out I came to find out that they charged my card a additional $235.00 for a tab that I cashed out on. I called the office and the bar and came to find out that the bartender named Mark let someone else run a tab on my room without my knowledge. I was disgusted with the service of this hotel. Be sure to watch your belongings because the staff have access in to the rooms and will STEAL what ever they can get their hands on.",1.0,1
"Excellent Oasis in Busy Mid-Town
My daughter and I selected the Marriott Marquis as our headquarters for a three-night NYC theater tour this summer and were very pleased with our choice. Despite the crowds, the wait for check-in was no more than five minutes. Check-in itself took even less time, and the friendly desk agent gave us a very quiet and comfortable room on the 41st floor. The new elevator system worked well, although if one is afraid of heights, riding the glass elevators to a high floor is reminiscent of ""The Tower of Terror"" in Disney World. That said, we liked being away from all of the street noise and chaos of the theater district, but within a few minutes' walk from the theaters and restaurants. We did not eat in the hotel, but all of the staff that we encountered could not have been more friendly and helpful. On our last day, luggage storage and delivery was handled well. We look forward to returning to this property and recommend it highly.",5.0,5
"Great Hotel and Service - with Two Exceptions
The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Chicago is an elegant hotel in a great location with the usual outstanding service by almost every employee. 
One drawback causing me to give a less than a perfect rating was that there was no radio in the room, and they did not even have one to bring to our room! I have never stayed in any U.S. hotel previously that did not have an FM radio in each room.
Also, the restaurant had less than enthusiastic service to put it kindly (reviewed elsewhere).",4.0,4
"Pleasant Stay
Was there on business from August 19th thru August 28th. This hotel's got just about everything one would expect from a Holiday Inn Express.
The front desk staff are very kind and courteous and helpful. I only stopped by for breakfast one time and found it to be very well done- good selection, and a nice ambiance in which to enjoy it.
Housekeeping was great and timely and did a fine job. The condition of the room was somewhat poor. The carpet was dirty and musty and the room had an odor, but it wasnt' overwhelming. The furniture was somewhat ""beat up"". Many surfaces had water marks and scuffs. The dresser drawers weren't fitting into the slots correctly and some of the bottoms of the drawers were falling out. The granite near the coffee pot and sink area had burn marks/stains. The bathroom was a good size with a large sink/vanity area, however the bathtub was tiny considering the large size of the bathroom. Water pressure was good and I always had hot water when needed.
Most of the ""in-room"" movies were over $10, so skip that. There was only one washer and dryer and I had to wait a good bit for use of the appliances. 
The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The bed was very clean. The AC didn't have a digital display, so I had to guess on the tempurature setting.",4.0,4
"Just the space you need
Pod 39 was a great location, minutes from Grand Central. Just mentally prepare yourself for the ""efficient"" room size.

Always looked at the SLS as a nice place for a ""stay-cation"" in Beverly Hills. I have a sense they are not keeping up to snuff. Last stay was just average.

Stayed here for 2 nights in November 2012. King bedded room was well appointed with very nice walk in shower with rain shower head. Unfortunately the expected services for this new Marriott Collection of hotels fell short. Front desk personnel were very pleasant and helpfull with directions but there was no concierge at all. Apparently, they offer turndown service but only on request, and I only found out by reading this right before checking out. Room service trays were left in the hallways for hours and I should not have to ask for toilet paper , liquid soap and tissues to be restocked after the room is made up for the day. This was the first time that I can remember that a newspaper was not left at my door as a Marriott Rewards member , although they were available at the front desk.

"This is pretty worn-out structure
The people running this hotel could not be nicer. Even the appearance of the room once in it is not unpleasant. The price (early November 2012) was around $85 with tax, so reasonable in my opinion. I picked it because I was familiar with the prosperity of the shopping just east of Beltway 8 and all of the Katy exits further west. But it's like everything around Wilcrest, all the way down to Westheimer, has been forgotten. It's a very old building, and kind of depressing. Every step you take you are looking at something that is scarred, torn, cracked, or run-down. It's just a little part of Houston that is not for those wanting that new and safe feeling.",2.0,2
"3 stars (priceline)... are you kidding me????
This was by far, the worst hotel I ever stayed at... I called priceline to question their star rating because I have stayed at other two star rated hotels that were much better than this one.... When I checked-in @ 10pm at night, the front desk told me that they did not have my reservation (hotel claims they never received the fax or email confirmation from priceline, however, priceline told us they had the fax confirmation from the day we made the reservation...2 days prior). It took almost 45 minutes for a priceline customer service rep to answer the call and finally resolve the issue for us to check in. The front desk people were very friendly and helpful even though they were very busy... After check-in, I had to walk down dark and old hallways for 5 minutes to get to my room.. As other reviewers mentioned, the carpet was dirty and old, the bath room was so small.. AC unit was loud and smelly.. I will never bid on priceline for hotels in the Dallas area since their star ratings are not very accurate... This hotel does not deserve 3 star rating...",1.0,1
"First and Last time I will be staying here.
I had a terrible experience staying at this hotel. I was here for a week in October. We checked in on a Saturday night and we were assigned a room on the 2nd floor facing 5th avenue. It was so loud in the room we could not even get to sleep. This hotel is located right in downtown and you will not be able to get to sleep in any room facing 5th avenue, unless you are really high up. So already your stay is ruined because of no sleep.
We asked if we could move to another room, but the person at the desk said they were full. They eventually got us another room on the second day which was facing 6th avenue. 
The second complaint I have is they will harass you everyday to come to a meeting with them in order for you to buy a timeshare. The first day, they said they would give us a $40 gift to show up to the meeting, but it is definitely not worth it because of the amount of time you spend with them. If you decline the first invitation, they will do whatever they can to get you to ruin your whole trip. You will get letters underneath your door, post cards hanging from your door and phone calls to your room in order to come to the meeting. 
We made a big mistake attending one these ""meetings"" with them in Florida, and it cost us $1500 for the week, that is how we ended up staying here at the Wyndham Harbour Lights. I will tell you it was the biggest mistake, because of how much of a rip of it is. You can rent places for weekly vacations at a much cheaper rate. So I recommend not attending these meetings, because they will convince you to buy something that is not worth it and you will regret it in the long run.
The third complaint I had was, the room service, they are suppose to clean your room every 3 days. They did not show up the one time because we had a ""do not disturb sign"" which was our fault, but we called them to clean it the next day and they forgot. So the room was left messy, the towels were dirty. Eventually we called the front desk, and Karen ended up cleaning our room quickly before we went to bed. 
The fourth complaint I have was when I was going to get some coffee down on the first floor which is free to everyone, I was a bit hungry and noticed some bagels on the table where they hold the meetings. Well when I went there, the person said ""Can I help you"", I said I just want to get a bagel, she told me you need to make an appointment. Are you serious???? I paid $1500 to stay here for a week and you are saying I can't have a bagel that cost $0.50 to them. This is ridiculous. I was really disappointed with them, it was an older lady in blonde hair and every time I walked by her she gave me a dirty look. Later on, we told that to Karen and she said I could have a bagel whenever I want. She was the only nice person there. 
Finally, this is not a place you want to go for a family of four. Two people will sleep nice in the bed, and the other 2 will break their backs on the sofa bed they have in the rooms. They are so uncomfortable because the mattresses are a lot thinner than normal sofa beds. By the end you will be glad to leave and go back in your own bed.
Overall you can see I had a terrible experience there, and I wouldn't recommend anyone staying there.",1.0,1
"Worst hotel experience I have ever had.
Stayed here for 2 nights. First night was uneventful but on the afternoon of the second day, someone in one of the other rooms was smoking marijuana and the smoke was filtering into my room through the vent fan duct in the restroom. It was so strong that I could literally see a haze in my room and the odor was making my eyes water and it made me nauseated. I called the front desk and was told they would ""look into it."" No one even bothered to stop by my room to verify the complaint. It finally got so bad that I was forced to open my windows (jeopardizing my safety and security) and leave my room because It was making me sick. I spent almost 2 hours calling other hotels so I could leave this place but unfortunately there was a city wide sell out in Austin that weekend and I could not find another hotel on short notice so I was forced to stay in this horrible place. I went to the front desk and asked to have my second night comped since they could not deliver the safe, secure room that I paid for. I was told I would receive a call from management and I did. Brian Morgan, Assistant General Manager called me and I explained the situation to him and that I could not find another hotel. Brian was incredibly rude to me on the phone and talked down to me as if I were a child. He refused to comp my room unless I checked out. I told him I would gladly leave but there is a city wide sell out and I have no where to go. I then asked to speak to his boss to which he exclaimed there was no one above him to talk to other than calling the corporate office. Remember, Brian is an ASSISTANT General Manger and I had the General Manager's business card in my hand. Brian lied to me. That is when I ended the conversation with Brian because when members of management lie to good, paying customers, it indicates they have absolutely no concern for the customer. All Brian cares about is my credit card. They finally gave me $20.00 off for that horrible day/night. That won't even cover the dry cleaning bill to get the smell of pot out of all of my clothes that were hanging in the room. Do yourself a favor, don't stay here.

"What you might expect for a budget motel
I selected this motel near Hollywood for several reasons: affordability, location, and the TA reviews.
Travelodge is a budget hotel chain that offers the basic necessities at a reasonable rate. With that in mind, realize that your expectations needed to be lowered. Yes, it would've been nice if the walls and windows had some sound proofing, my neighbors didn't snore, and the floors didn't creak. On my first of six nights, I awoke to a bunch of guys talking loudly in the parking lot at about 1 am. A call to the front desk did fix the problem. 
I tried using the hair dryer, but it was defective and looked like it might cause electric shock. The motel does offer a free breakfast, but don't expect much, watered down coffee, white bread, muffins, cereal that's dispensed like dry pet food. My other peeve was finding a few ants in the bathroom on the first day.
Now on to the good. There's free wifi. The TV has many cable channels including all HBO channels. There's a pool that's clean. Free parking. A safe in the room. And a big plus for me was the LA Metro subway is only a block away. If walk past the Metro station (Vermont/Sunset) there's a very nice section of shops and restaurants. If your'e walking toward Wendy's you're going the wrong way. I felt pretty safe on the streets. Of course you'll find homeless people and other sorts wandering around, but it's a major city -- get used to it.
Bottom Line. In my travels around LA I've seen many hotels like this. Some better, and some much worse. I'd recommend this place for a short stay with the expectation that this won't be a night at the Hilton.",3.0,3
"Room 651, large bath, street noise
I stayed for 4 nights for a conference. The rooms are pretty standard with a large desk and good seating at the desk. There is a ""snack dispenser"" on the console holding the television. It has a sign that says that if it is disturbed, you will be charged for taking the contents. This prevents the use of over half the counter space in the room. The fridge is also unusable due to the same sign on the mini-fridge. The room had audible noise from the front traffic circle with the conversations of the guests and the valet staff clearly audible at all hours. The shower had a bowed out shower curtain rod, always appreciated. The wait staff for all the functions was astounding. Great service, swift and professional, delightful staff. Harvey in the coffee shop was especially good. I was frustrated with the menu offering limited choices if you wanted a small breakfast. I had to order much more than I wanted due to the limited menu. The buffet is not an option for a smaller meal due to the price. Quick meals as you are running between meetings is not possible either. I had a very bland turkey sandwich from the Starbucks for $7.50, not the type of quality or the variety I would expect for the price. The room was kept perfectly clean and I was impressed with how fast the staff cleaned up the room service items from the hall way floors. Even the tiny knob that was on the desk in the hallway had been replaced within 30 minutes of my first spotting it early one morning. Overall, ok stay but the hotel really needs to widen the dining options for smaller appetites and quick lunches for people scurrying to meetings.",3.0,3
"Not a AAA Four Diamond Resort
First off, I did stay in the off season this July and sepent a full week, however that really is no excuse. The room furniture is bland, nothing custom made. The bathrooms dont have a phone, in fact there was only one phone in the entire room. The towels were stiff like they had been dried outside, and they often did not provide enough or left out some, like hand towels or washcloths and did not replace the bar soap or shampoo once. When I called the front desk on three occasions, it took them once 19 rings to answer and twice nobody answered at all and this was in the evening not during peak check in time. There is no complimentary town car service at all and if you do not have a car, you are not by anything. They do provide complimentary shuttle service to the fashion mall but even the stores there are soso. One of the worse Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy stores I have been to. Went to the bar, but not very well stocked. No beer selection except coors and crona for 7.50 a bottle. To top it all off, every bar server but one didnt bring a glass for me to drink my beer out of or offer. The one that did was also the only one that offered a nut mix which was ok but not great but at least it was complimentary so apparently they have only one competent server. Did have a descent wine selection and humidor. Architecture and layout is good, Frank and Alberts breakfast is worth the money. That is it though.",2.0,2
"If you need internet connections, stay away
I liked this place in many respects -- comfortable and moderately priced room, close to Folsom street and all it has to offer.

Problem occurred with my MacBook Pro, my iPhone, and my iPad (which never connected).

What a relief to be in the city and not have to navigate the narrow streets and search for parking.

We stayed 4 nights at the historic Mayflower or should I say prehistoric? The hotel is apparently under construction although the only remodeling I was aware of was the Metro line outside. The hotel has a makeshift restaurant in a meeting room and a lounge without a bar. We found no room service menu in our small room so was surprised on our last night to hear room service was available. Our first night a family was holding court in the hallway until 3 am. Security came and went and the chatter continued.Rooms are tired, bathroom small but adequate, beds are comfortable pillows are not. Fan in ceiling above bath was dirty and moldy.Doormen and housekeeping pleasant, front desk not so much. Nice gesture might have been free Internet during construction but customer service is not valued here as is inconsistent treatment of guests. And I am a member of Renaissance Marriott. So many other fabulous hotels to choose from.",2.0,2
"dirty tired and stained
I must say that this was my husband experience not mine. I would have left after what he found there... I mean, he told me the room was tired, had stained looked furniture, and is badly in need of remodeling. On top of it all, there was an acrid smell in the room... soon enough while unpacking the source of the smell was uncovered. A drawer full of rotten fruits. Does anyone ever clean the room? what exactly is cleaned after a guest left and another is presented to the rooms? Fortunately, the cleaning crew responded to the complaint and quickly act to solve the problem. In all, the staff are helpful, but the hotel infrastructure is in need of improvement.",2.0,2
"OK for a budget hotel
I just spent a week in this hotel. It has its ups and downs. 
Pros
Very inexpensive. With the money we saved staying at this hotel we paid for most of what we did during the day.
Basic amenities. Front desk, lobby, elevator, hot water, 
Location is right off Broadway and two blocks from the Subway and from Riverside Park. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.
Daily room cleaning. Bed made and clean towels every day. 
Shower was modern and very comfortable. 
AC
We had a private bath, but I checked out the shared one in the hallway. Clean and basic. 
Cons
Very basic. 
The elevator is small. Max three people. Very very slow. We stayed on the fifth floor and we climbed the steps most of the time. 
Our door only shut when it was locked. 
Our AC worked but looked disgusting. It only had two effective settings. Fan on or off. AC on or off. The room would actually get too cold over night. Which was amazing because it was very hot outside. 
Front desk help is inconsistent. Sometimes they were wonderful and when out of their way to help and sometimes they seemed very uninterested in our questions.
Wireless internet only works in the lobby.
Still I would stay here again. And I would recommend it, but don't have your hopes set too high.",3.0,3
"crack motel
It was rediculous. we checked in, went to the room, and was horrified. the guy at the desk was very rude. after praying febreze on everything in the room we sat down trying to make our selves believe it wasnt as bad as it looked but then the lady next to us was having a fight with her pimp next door and ruined that. I took my gun and went to the office to check out. the parking lot was extremely ghetto. Scary! now im fighting with them to get my money back. my reciept says 30 but theres a 120.00 charge. awesome! you can stay at the extended stay where there are not rats and hookers and theres a pool fitness center and much more for 50 bucks.",1.0,1
"Very Enjoyable
Hotel Lombardy was so enjoyable from the time we walked in the door. The staff was friendly, the room were very clean and updated. We loved the old world charm, the 2 doors and the door knobs. The location was convenient, within walking distance to the sights, or the bus or metro was down the street, and within walking distance to Georgetown. We would stay here again.",5.0,5
"Excellent room and a real value!
The price was terrific as far as hotels in the LA area goes. Our room was ready earlier than we expected, which gave us an extra hour on the beach after dropping our things off in the room. The room was super clean, the bathroom was fully stocked with towels and toiletries, the linens were freshly laundered and smelled like fresh cotton blossom (and in a smoking room to boot!!) and the room even had a fridge for our water and soda which was nice. The air conditioner was really chilly when on high, which we loved! Check in was smooth and the front desk clerk was very friendly.The continental breakfast was great too, we had toasted bagels and cream cheese, a bowl of cereal and we grabbed a danish for the road as well as a cup of coffee, it was just right for us. I would absolutely stay here again and am highly recommending it to others. Great job HOJO!!!!",5.0,5
"Met expectations!
Needed a short overnight Pre-surgery and Crowne Plaza worked perfectly. Clean, fresh, friendly. Used valet parking. Breakfast would have been a nice bonus for my friend. Location was good and access was easy",5.0,5
"Needs upkeep
I would have loved to stay in a historic hotel like this one if it was maintained. We had no air circulation in our room. The molding above the door in the bathroom was missing, and the door frame was cracked. The water took about 5 or 10 minutes to heat up. The walls were paper thin, and I got stuck listening to a crying baby for 2 nights. Also, I came back one evening to discover my door had been left open by housekeeping for nearly 5 hours. Luckily, nothing was taken, but I was very disappointed in such carelessness. Overall, an awful experience and I will never stay here again.",1.0,1
"Broadway Trip
Rooms were small and nothing special but locaiton was perferct. Price was good versus other hotels. Use window AC units that are loud.",3.0,3
"Very good, but definitely not great
The Hilton New York is what you would expect from a big name, big city hotel...reasonable large room, comfortable bed, quality bath products, great location just two blocks from Radio City Music Hall.
But like several people have stated in reviews, the service is a bit lackluster, with people seeming more concerned about getting their hands on any tips you may offer instead of simply providing quality service. And when it comes time to go downstairs in the morning, be prepared to do some waiting for an elevator. We had eight (yes, eight) elevators stop going down that didn't have room to even add one more small child, let alone two adults. Finally, an elevator going up stopped on the floor and we rode it up just to be able to get down.
I wasn't disappointed in my stay. It was comfortable and it provided the services and offered the location I wanted. I just felt like it could have been so much more with just a little caring.",4.0,4
"Old and bad service
According to the reviews the hotel was good. No! The hotel is not good! Apart from the location, which is great, there's nothing worth the price paid. The service of front desk staff is very bad: they are rude and make no effort to help, at all. The breakfast was poor and always the same. Most times the buns/ bread was served almost frozen! The only good thing was the cleanliness of our room (made ​​by Mary I) that although old, was very large and very well cleaned every day. Thank you Mary!
As a suggestion, the hotel must urgently renew all carpets (rooms, the breakfast area and lobby / hall).
Just for the record: they charge about $ 8/day for parking your car, which is not a big deal, since parking is a rarity in LA.",2.0,2
"A Great Stay in a Great City
This was our second stay at the Parc 55. It is much-improved after the renovation. The lobby, restaurant and other public areas are stylish. The room was large and comfortable, with a great view to the north and west, including the Transamerica tower. The location is excellent, one block from the Powell BART / Muni station, two blocks from Union Square, surrounded by restaurants and shopping. Given the recent concern over bed-bugs in several US cities, we checked the bed carefully and found nothing. Wireless internet was available but cost $14/day, so if you have a 3G USB stick it will save you some money. Our only complaints are 4 minor annoyances that may have been the result of incomplete detailing after the renovation: 1) the TV cable box didn't work and required 4 technician visits to troubleshoot (ask for Allen to go straight to the best); 2) the bathroom door didn't close properly; 3) the alarm clock had no battery backup and had to be reset at least daily; and 4) one of the bedside lamps was not plugged in, and the nearest receptacle was inaccessible.",4.0,4
"Hotel Staff was Great! View was Great! Location was Great! Room was...
I will start off with the good. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and this includes everyone from the front desk to the bellman to the cleaning people. They were all nice and friendly. We were on an upper level with an amazing view of the space needle. The hotel is located half way between the space needle and Pikes Place. It is very walkable distance to both and the area appeared to be relatively safe. We were out until 11:30 and did run into any problems. We received a free American breakfast with our stay and the food was good. The scones were amazing!
Now for the bad. The room has seen better days. The carpet was stained. The floor boards were screaming for a fresh coat of paint. The decor was early 80's. The TV was a tube TV from the mid 90's. The corners and edges of the wood furniture were beaten up. Just not a very nice room. It was clean, just old. I would like to think the carpet was clean and just stained, but there is really no telling. I decided to leave my sandal on the while time I was there. 
The Warwick was supposed to have completed the remodel of all, but the lower floors, but the room we had was on of the ""classic"" rooms. Their website even states the ""classic"" rooms are located on the lower floors, but I assure you we had a ""classic"" (AKA rundown) room and it was on the 19th floor. 
We only stayed there for one night, so we just dealt with the room that reminded us of a roadside lodge.
With this said, I cant emphasize how nice the staff was. That is the reason the Warwick received a 3 and not a 2. If were to stay here again, I would be sure to sacrifice the view for a remodeled room. The room was $200, not bad for a remodeled room in downtown Seattle, but over priced for a ""classic"" room",3.0,3
"Very Bad experience
Checked in and they couldn't find me in their system. I showed them my confirmation email, she then found my reservation and then she told me that I booked with a third party. I explained that I had paid an extra $200 for a suite on a higher level with a city view. She reminded me that I booked with a third party and they only had 5 rooms left and none were with a city view or a suite. All she could offer was a standard room on the 5th floor and was rude about it. Nothing else was offered and I had to also pay $60 for parking on top of that. I took the room, but I would never stay there again. It wasn't even that nice, can't believe it is 4 stars, what a terrible experience!!",1.0,1
"I'd avoid it.
There are so many bad bad things about this hotel, my impulse is to say AVOID AT ALL COSTS. But I'll be generous and give you the upsides as well.
First of all, I was scheduled to arrive the day Hurricane Sandy hit. My flight was canceled and I had to reschedule. Despite the hotel's written policy that I'd have to pay for the FULL reservation (not just one night) if I did not cancel over a day in advance, they graciously let me move my reservation without penalty. But the new days I was planning to stay were significantly more expensive because they coincided with the marathon. The person I was speaking to on the phone was so so so flustered. I could barely understand him because he seemed very rattled. I found out later, that it was how he always communicates. He (the manager) is a very difficult person to deal with. Treat this man with kid gloves. He's temperamental and overly defensive. He might actually mean well, but his demeanor is unpleasant. Because of the weather, my flight was cancelled again and although I called and explained, it was not noted or changed. Luckily, one of the other employees called me when I didn't show up when they expected me, and I got the new reservations straightened out. 
The website states that the rooms start at $149.00 per night. But I was paying a whopping $358 because my trip got pushed to marathon weekend and everyone else was sold out. This is more than I've paid to stay at the Plaza Hotel in NY. And the room they gave us was a horror show. Check the pictures. It was microscopic. It had a very very small bed for two people. The bed was shoved against the wall. It was HARD AS A ROCK. The pillows were too fat and also hard so I couldn't use them at all. After trying to sleep for 3 hours with no luck, I got a towel and tried to use it as a pillow. It was pretty hard as well. I would have been more comfortable on the floor, if there had been any room. The next day, I went to Kmart and bought my own pillow.
I also felt itchy in the bed. I haven't looked this hotel up on the bedbug website, because I'm actually afraid to know. But I suspect. Oh do I suspect.
The bathroom was so narrow that your shoulders will touch the wall on either side of the toilet. I never even looked in the shower. There was no tub. The toilet made a very loud flushing type noise every 30 seconds or so. All night long. It was like loud waves crashing. 
The hallways are not carpeted. They actually have nice, inlaid wood floors. But this amplifies every noise that occurs in the hall. We were near the elevator and we had to hear every drunk person who stumbled in all night long. And in the morning, there was the cleaning staff having long, loud conversations for our entertainment.
I think they gave us the worst room they had for the highest price. 
I spent the whole night agonizing about what to do. Should I ask for another room, or should I ask for a reduction in price - considering the marathon was canceled. Ultimately, I politely and meekly asked for another room. The manager was very offended, and treated me very rudely. But he did give me another room. He had me ""pack up immediately and bring all my bags down"". He couldn't tell me when the new room would be ready, so we had to spend a whole day without having had a shower. When we returned much later in the day, he had the bags in our new room. It was of a decent size. It had the same, small, hard bed, but at least one of us wasn't smashed up against the wall. And the toilet didn't run, and it had a tub. So it was worth the base price of $149.00 
If you must stay there for whatever reason, try to get the larger size room, and try not to pay more than $149. 
The small horrible room was room number 608. The larger room was room number 312.
I'm including pictures of both. As promised, I'm listing the upsides (as well as reiterating the downsides)
Upsides: 
-The hotel had free wifi, but I don't think the rooms on the west side had a good connection because there were always people sitting in the hallway with their computers. We had no trouble in our rooms, both of which were on the east side of the hotel.
-Excellent location if you love the Upper West Side and the Park, as I do.
-Free coffee in the lobby
-Flexible on changing reservations
Downsides: 
-Manager
-small, rock hard beds
-small rooms
-iffy wifi
-old carpet
-possible noisy toilets
-tiny bathrooms
-hard pillows
-possible bedbugs
-noisy halls",1.0,1
"Perfect stay
We stayed at this hotel from May 9th to 16th 2012. The location is perfect, only a 2-minute walk from Union Square and many shops and restaurants. The hotel staff was very friendly and welcoming, especialy Dorothy and Joshua. They were very helpful and always ready to suggest a restaurant or give any advice about activities the city has to offer. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. We were expecting a smaller room since we've read this on TripAdvisor but our room was the perfect size for what we needed. We stayed there for a week, the room size never bothered us. If you are a light sleeper, maybe ask for a room in the back since the rooms facing Union Square can be noisy at times. Personally, we didn't really notice the street noise during our sleep. All in all, the best hotel we've ever stayed at, for the price, the location and the welcoming staff.",5.0,5
"Expensive, poor value
It is a big souless hotel, where they charge you for everything a hefty price. Unfortunately quality does not reflect those. Hotel is not that old, but it is made in this 70ties style so it looks dated. There is only one place that serves breakfast, which is untasty and if you are unlucky there would be a long queue. I strongly advise to avoid this hotel.",2.0,2
"Comfortable, Clean, Extremely Convenient
Excellent Back Bay location: Prudential ""T"" station just steps from entrance and across street from Prudential Center restaurants & shops. Twenty minute walk to Fenway.

Roof-top pool great place to cool off.",5.0,5

I love this hotel in every way. The service was terrific and each staff member was professional, attentive, courteous and helpful. The food services people were beyond compare in their presentation and quality. I love the front desk manager and associates. They went above and beyond to be helpful. The location is superb and close to all the 'happenings'. My room was spacious and clean, soft towels. The fridge and microwave in the room topped it off!
I will definitely return to this hotel.",5.0,5
"Old hotel and looks it.
I stayed here for the Boston Marathon. The location is ideal. What you gain in location you lose in hotel amenities. Rooms do not have refrigerators or mini-bars. The rooms are small in nature. The furniture has seen many guests. One unique feature of the hotel, the hallways seem wide enough for driving a car. The lobby, while grand seemed dark to me. There is a mobile coffee kiosk based in the lobby during the morning. The kiosk does not add any charm to the lobby.
 If you have the urge to experience what it was like to stay in a hotel in 1930's this is the hotel to stay at. 
On the positive side, the staff seemed genuinely concerned about guest needs.The hotel is also surrounded by many restaurants. I would suggest the Au bon pain for breakfast.",3.0,3
"By far, the best hotel I've ever stayed!
I stayed at this hotel w/ my girlfriend on March, 2011. The hotel is absolutely fantastic! Since front desk until the bedroom, nothing to complain about. Anna (I guess this was her name), who did our check-in, really helped us and pointed out the main attractions and restaurants in the city. The room is great, w/ a huge and comfy bed and a super clean bathroom. Actually the room was also really, really clean! The breakfast was so good...a real American meal...the hotel location was another great point! Just few steps far from the White House!! Absolutely fantastic! Definitely my home back in DC!",5.0,5
"Nice place, but has some problems
We stayed here for 2 nights in July; spent a day sightseeing in Boston, then flew home the next morning. The room was clean and comfortable with a view of the airport (opted not to pay extra for harbor view). The front desk staff, concierge and bellmen were great.
The downsides:
Shuttle service - some of the drivers seem to have a real attitude problem (driving by us without stopping, after requesting pick up; arguing loudly over their radio) while others were friendly and helpful. Usual wait for shuttle was 20-30 minutes.
Food - room service was SLOW (45-60 min), then one plate was forgotten, which took another 30 minutes. Food was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the price. Delivery person was very friendly, though. Tried to eat breakfast at the hotel but it was a 30-40 minute wait (!), so we opted to eat in town.
Did not use fitness facilitiies. Tried to print out boarding passes but the computer terminal for doing so was not working. $12.95 per device, per day, is unreasonablly high for internet access, in my estimation. Having the water taxi right next to the hotel is convenient, but a pricey alternative to get into town.
Was not bothered by any airport noise, but was woken up by other guests (early risers), as well as housekeeping knocking on nearby doors.
The Hyatt is fine, but if I need to stay at the Boston airport again, I'll try someplace else.",3.0,3
"Way overpriced!
This hotel is not bad in and of itself. Everything was clean and in good working order. The staff are friendly and courteous. The only complaint I have is that EVERYTHING at this hotel is overpriced. Room: $150 (been there before, not a huge deal, but there's nothing about the place to justify it). Internet: $4.95/hr or 14.95/day ( they do have free public wi-fi in lobby. It's slow and lobby is loud, so forget Skype-ing the wife and kids). Really? It's 2012 and I've stayed at Motel 6s with better, FREE wi-fi. Parking: $20/day to self-park!! Come on! Restaurant: A run-of-the-mill Rueben and 2 domestic draft beers? A mere $32. This was the second time my office has booked me here, and it will be the last. I found WAY cheaper, better options right across the street.",3.0,3
"Hotel Stay 2/18/2012
The only good thing I will say about the hotel is that they kept my reservation... The room I was in was filthy. The carpet was stained and burned in a no smoking room. There was a dirty recliner in the room that wouldn't recline. The heater made a loud noise all night long, got very little sleep. The dresser had chunks busted out of it and holes in the top. The bathtub was horrible, both my husband and myself took sponge baths for fear of getting a disease from the filth. The baseboards in the bathroom had dirt not dust a quarter of an inch thick on them. Then to top it all off housekeeping opened our door 2 hours before check out time and asked us if we were going to check out. When I complained at the front desk during check out he never said a word. So needless to say I won't be going there again...",1.0,1
"Adequate
There is a lot of history to to this hotel, and it tends to show in the wrong ways: old-style marble trim in rather drab hallways, for example. The rooms are tiny, i.e normal for New York, and the attempts at Art Deco styling are not very successful. A plus for me was the casement window, which opened. I prefer that to the hermetic HVAC systems of modern hotels. A minus was that there was almost no ledge, and no sink counter, in the bathroom. If you're mot careful, leaning over the sink to splash water on your face can lead to a bonk on the forehead from what ledge there is. 
Apparently certain floors of the building are residential or offices; the upper floors are hotel. It makes for a busy lobby, and annoying security near the elevators. The all-night old-fashioned diner, off the lobby, seems nice on paper but looked hideous from the doorway. The best thing about the hotel is its location a block from Penn Station, allowing for easy access to the subways and the train to Newark Airport.",3.0,3
"Unexpectedly disappointing
I was really looking forward to a comfortable stay in a nice hotel for a few nights - first time in beautiful San Fran! What i got was an unfriendly face at reception greeting me (after some ~22 hours of traveling) and it took the check in agent around 7 hours to sort out my payment details (which involved the ridiculous solution of splitting my single booking into two separate bookings) even though the credit card details had been provided at the time of booking several weeks in advance of my arrival. I was then over charged $369 which has now been fully refunded. What i would like to point out is that once the general manager of guest services stepped in to help out with all of this an apology was quickly forth-coming and i was kindly provided with a complimentary meal. While I'm grateful for the manager's efforts here and generally pleased with the outcome, it's frustrating that it happened in the first place and, overall, The Westin is not a place i'd recommend or stay at again. In addition to this negative experience, (and it may just have been a culture shock since i'm not from the USA) i was surprised at the number of hidden charges involved with staying at this hotel e.g. to be able to use a fridge i had to get one delivered to my room (tipped the delivery person), ordered room service (tipped the delivery person and paid 18% gratuity on the bill), tipped to have my bags stowed, tipped to pick my bags up, tipped to walk in and out of the front door, tipped to organise a taxi or talk to concierge, tipped house-keeping, tipped check-in agent. It is also inconvenient that there is no laundry unless one wishes to pay a ridiculous $3 per pair of socks and $7.50 for jeans! After a few nights i moved two blocks away to a different hotel that was 1/3 the price and spent the rest of my time there. It was far more convenient (fridge and laundry included) with delightful staff and an equally as appealing location.",2.0,2
"Nice hotel-but not in Times Square
The room we had was quite large-they called it a ""Family Room"". I highly recommend this as an economical way for a large family to stay in NYC. The room had 2 queen size beds, Murphy style bunk beds and a sofa (not sure if it was a sofa bed or not).
The only negative is that the sheets in one of the beds were really dirty. I doubt that they had been changed from the last guest. When my husband told the manager the following morning, he replied that we should have notified them to come up and change the sheets. But after a long day of travel, and then working in the City, a 10 pm call to wait for someone to come and change the sheets, was not gonna happen! Other than that small issue, the hotel was a good value.",4.0,4
"The Ritz is the best!
I had an amazing long weekend with my grand mother and my husband. The staff were extremely helpful, the location was just right and the building was just a delight. ""Amazing historic building"". The restaurant and the food was just excellent.
The Ritz as usual lives up to its name.
Will be back for sure!",5.0,5
"Trying to get their act together
I've stayed at this property numerous times over the past few years due to its convenient access to IAH. Each time I stay there...I want it to be better. On this trip, I had two separate one-night stays, one evening apart. Both times, I was on the Club Level floor, but the two different rooms in which I stayed were miles apart in comfort. The first room, 1017, had an old, clunky air conditioning system that really didn't work, and a toilet that worked too well (it was in a state of continual flushing). Since I arrived late and left early, I didn't bring these to the attention of the management until check-out--I hope they've taken measures to correct these flaws. The second room, 1044, was quite nice and everything worked. On my previous visits, the Club Lounge was not open on weekends--it is now. The food is plentiful and good and ""discounted"" wine and cocktails are available, although still overpriced. (Just go across the street to a liquor store if you want wine--it'll save you $$$.) Too, the service from the Club Lounge attendants was excellent. My one recommendation would be to switch TV stations from Fox News to something less inflammatory. I don't need biased commentators screeching at me at 7:00 a.m. The Today Show, perhaps??? 
Overall, I will stay at this Sheraton again as the staff is friendly and helpful--it's not their fault that the upkeep of some of the sleeping rooms isn't great and that food (at Basil's) and drinks are over-the-top in cost.",3.0,3
"A great hotel and experience
We got to the hotel early and they were able to get us checked in. The hotel is very welcoming and the staff was very nice and helpful suggesting places to eat. There is a courtesy shuttle that runs hourly that will take you to and from the river walk, but we opted to drive so we had the convenience. The parking is difficult at the River Walk, so it is a trade off of not dealing with the parking and using the shuttle or driving yourself and being able to leave when you want. The towels were very soft and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was awesome with waffles, biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bagels, muffins, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, and more. They have a manager's reception the night we were there (not sure what night's it is available) which included all you can drink and/or eat wine and beer along with cheese and crackers and chips and salsa. It was really good and there is indoor and outdoor seating. Next time I am in the area I will stay here again.",5.0,5
"Great stay during business trip
Stayed in queen/queen room 1402 for a business trip. Found the room to be very spacious for a downtown room and was pleased that it had a desk with two desk chairs to facilitate two people working together at the desk. While the view was of the building next door the large windows provided plenty of natural light.
The service in the hotel was all around great during our stay. We were regularly assisted by Foster who was always kind and helpful. The housekeeping service was top notch in always tending to the details. From leaving a note to ask if they could do anything additional to stocking the room with a few bottled waters from the gym after seeing I had been working out.
The only place I would suggest improvement would be the service in the restaurant. While it was often very good there were a few experiences we had where the servers seemed rushed or inattentive. This was especially true during breakfast one morning.",5.0,5
"Simply the best!!
I had the priviledge of staying at Hotel Commonwealth with my sister while celebrating my 30th birthday and I can't say enough good things about this place. We stayed in the baseball suite, and even though we're not baseball fans, we were stunned at how beautiful the room was. The staff was so nice and Samuel (the best concierge ever!) found out it was my birthday and went above and beyond to make the day special for me. I can't wait to stay there again!!",5.0,5
"It's OK!
This relatively new hotel is in a relatively desolate area by the new airport, and as a result, it's easy to get lost. One cab driver from downtown Indy took me to the wrong hotel, while another had no idea where to go and insisted that I look up directions on my phone. Yikes. So make sure you know how to get back here yourself if you don't have a car.
The hotel itself is comfortable, if without frills. The shuttle service from the airport is reliable, parking is plentiful, and if you do end up getting stuck at the hotel, the in-house restaurant is affordable and better than you might expect. Service was above-average, but you would never leave this hotel and think ""I can't wait to get back!"", which is more a function of its lot in life as opposed to anything wrong about the hotel itself.",3.0,3

Pluses: relatively good situation downtown, shuttle service easily available. Liitle Toky nearby.
Minuses: Hispeed internet is very slow, 10$ charge per day. (writing this review in a Senegal, Dakar hotel with free really hispeed internet).
Being European it doesn't give a good feeling to leave the hotel with a bill that is 70% higher than the originally agreed price, due to internet, breakfast, taxes. I know it is your system, I just tell you how it works out for me....",3.0,3

My family spent 4 nights at the Distrikt Hotel. I was expecting the room to be small since this is Manhattan. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it quite spacious. The beds were the most comfortable I ever slept in. We received brownies on our first night and chocolates every night. The ice tea (Raspberry, Mango, Blueberry) in the lobby was always a refreshing treat after a long day of exploring the city. I really liked the make up mirror attached to the bathroom wall. The staff is very friendly. The employee that worked a double shift since 3 pm yesterday was still very curtious when we checked out this morning. I even bought a robe for $85.00 to take home as a souviner of our pleasant stay.",5.0,5
"Very disappointed!
Check in at the hotel was quick and efficient, but we were very disappointed with our room. The first thing we saw when we opened the door was the beds, which we practically had to crawl over in order to get into the room. The bathroom was big, and mostly clean, but there was only a small stand up shower instead of a tub/shower combination... Definitely NOT CONVENIENT when you're traveling with young children who aren't old enough to shower alone. Breakfast was decent, but the breakfast space is too small to accommodate the number of guests who take advantage of the breakfast, not to mention the fact that guests are having to prepare their own breakfasts if they want anything other than eggs and sausages.",2.0,2
"Nice stay
Stayed at Royal Sonesta for a weekend getaway. Nice hotel across the street from the inner harbor attractions. Staff was friendly. Only complain was no mini fridge without breaking the seal to the mini bar which = extra charges, so if you bring your own water or soda be prepared to use the Ice bucket( in room bottle of water is $5.00)",4.0,4
"Great location, ok hotel
I stayed here while taking my 16 year old to see colleges. I Pricelined, got room for $180, and, for Boston, got what I paid for. Location is fabulous. Tons of great restaurants, many in walking distance, public transport right there, as is entrance to Mass Pike. It is typical old, huge Boston hotel, decor was nice, clean rooms on small side (esp bathrooms). Staff helpful and friendly. Cons: they are remodeling and the banging started around 7 am. 1/2 hr free Wi Fi in lobby only. I didn't give this a thought as I have 3G on my phone however, after a day of driving and two campus tours, when we got back to the room and my son learned his iPad had no internet connection, it wasn't pretty. My bad.",3.0,3
"Good location but DIRTY!
We stayed at this hotel because of it's close proximity to the Philadelphia airport. But upon arrival, we found that there are many other hotels to choose from in the same location that I'm sure provided their guests with better accommodations. First of all, both of the two rooms that we reserved were DIRTY. One of the rooms had burn holes in their bedding. And one of our traveling companions was propositioned in the elevator - even had a ""calling"" card given to him. There was a minimal breakfast offered in the morning. The shuttle service went OK....and our car was still there when we returned from our trip. This hotel is a disgrace to the Microtel Inn chain - take your business elsewhere.",1.0,1
"What more could you want?
Well maintained and super clean hotel where drinks (alcoholic and soft) and dinner snacks are free and the hot breakfast is free. Very convenient and pretty tasty. Plus it has a very nice hot tub w/ indoor outdoor pool. You just couldn't ask for anything more from a hotel!
I also liked the fact that the elevator and parking were secure. You had to use your room pass to activate the elevator and garage doors.
Lots of kids and families were here having a great time.",5.0,5
"Nice hotel, convenient location!
The hotel is very nice, rooms are accomodating--ours had a mini-fridge which was handy for our 6 night stay. We realized after our first night there that there are a bunch of restaurants on the Metro level (below the lobby) which the front desk didn't tell us about--that is also where you can catch the Metro and you don't ever have to go outside. Very convenient! Wifi is not free, but that's about typical. Pool is nice, rooftop and even though they say it's heated, it is still not very warm. It is about 3/4 mile walk to the Washington Monument--we actually had a beautiful view from our room of the monument. The Smithsonian Musuems are not far, along with the National Mall. I would not recommend driving, just because of lack of parking and ease of access to the Metro. Our cab ride was $16 from DCA airport. We also walked to the ""Wharf"" and had dinner..very nice!",4.0,4
"Old, noisy and nasty hotel
We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights last week. The hotel is old. Lobby and the hallways are way outdated. Room looked slightly better than the lobby. First of all, neither of us hardly slept all night. Walls are like paper and you can hear the exact conversations on the street even though we were on the 4th floor. Air conditioning unit is the oldest I have ever seen. Every time it kicks in, it makes lots of noise. You could hear every door opened all the hallway all night long. On top of all this, we were charged for 2 nights parking when we only parked one night. They are refusing to reimburse us since they are saying when you check in they assume you will keep the car for 2 nights with valet unless you tell them otherwise. It is nonsense. They know when we took it out and we weren't told to notify them otherwise. First time we called they lied to me and said they did an inventory and know the car was there at 9 pm second night when we knew we took it out in the am. Second time I called and talked to the manager, he came up with a different story. I wouldn't suggest this hotel to anybody. Not only it is loud, old and dirty, their customer service is also not good.",1.0,1
"Nice hotel
I made my reservation by phone, the agent assisted me in getting the best price & room and was very helpful. This is an older hotel which gave it an old/new feel. The hotel was very clean and the view on the 14th floor was phenominal with a memorable sunrise, view of mountains, Lake Washington and Mt. Rainer sitting majestically to the southeast. The bed was comfortable with a good pillow - not too fluffy. My only problem was no wi-fi access which is a big deal to me. I went down to the front desk for assistance, the clerk wasn't able to resolve the problem. He was assisting another guest who also couldn't connect to wi-fi and could only provide a phone number for guests to call the internet provider for assistance. The other guest stated that she tried but just got voice mail, she too was frustrated that the hotel was unable to resolve the problem. Nice hotel but come'on, guests shouldn't have to call the internet provider for assistance, that is the hotel's job! Maybe a rating of 4 is too high for this reason.",4.0,4
"Awful hotel
The hotel had no hot water during my entire 3 day stay, and I only found out after asking another guest in the elevator that the hot water had been out for an entire week BEFORE I arrived. How could they say nothing to me? In the morning, I called early and asked them to move me to another room because the rug was wet and there was an odd smell in the room. I was told that they couldn't do anything at that time because guests hadn't yet checked out, but they would move me during the day. I get back to the hotel at 9pm (I told them I would be back late), and they said they couldn't move me and hadn't heard anything about it. Really?? Unbelievable. Front desk night manager wasn't helpful at all--no apology, no nothing. As if that wasn't enough, I go downstairs to go in the jacuzzi to warm up ahead of my cold shower--the jacuzzi wasn't hot--probably around 95 degrees! Just an all around poor hotel with poor management.",1.0,1
"Great Hotel in NYC
Our family of six (four kids ages range from 16-9) stayed in two King suites. I called the hotel a few times to ensure that we had two King Suites with sofa beds with either connecting or adjoining rooms. When we arrived, we had exactly that. 
We really liked the area. I have always stayed in mid town. This was the first time in Battery Park. It was nice to get away from the crowds especially with the family. The area felt safe (for NYC). There is a nice path across the street that goes along the river. The subway is about a 5 min walk. We drove into NYC. The location made it easy to get in and out of Manhattan. Whole Foods is just a couple of blocks away. We ordered a refrigerator for the room. So, it was easy to have breakfast in the rooms. 
The rooms were very spacious. I liked the design. The living area with sofa bed was as you entered the suite. Then the bathroom area separated the living area and bedroom. Vanity and toilet in one room. Shower in another room. Great shower. Both opened onto the hallway between the bedroom and living room. The “hallway” had a wet bar on one wall. It was nice to have an extra sink. The hallway can be closed off when taking shower to make the bathroom area bigger. 
I would definitely recommend the hotel again especially for families.",5.0,5
"Once but never again
We visited this hotel this summer 2012. The best thing about this large hotel is it's location; most of the rooms have no view what so ever. The pool is very very small. You don't have any privacy when you want to sit outside your room (no balcony). Our stay became particularly a bad experience because of the rudeness and arrogance of the hotel staff, more precisely the personnel in the restaurant and the hotel manager himself. We stayed for two nights with four persons (two kids). We had an arrangement including a free breakfast. When we checked in we got four coupons for the restaurant. We thought that this was for the breakfast on the first day, and that we would receive four more coupons for the next day. This was not the case. We had to pay which led to a discussion in the restaurant and later on with the hotel manager because we paid for three persons (our youngest boy stayed for free). Their story: free breakfast for two persons because you booked a two persons room. We felt misled of course but were most upset by the way we were spoken to by the staff. Very rude, arrogant and unprofessional. So bad that we didn't even had any breakfast at all. This was once but never again.",1.0,1
"Decent stay but...
Wi-Fi is bad in the rooms...for $14.95 a day (which is RIDICULOUS), it is a slow and poor connection. 
$45 for room service for 2 eggs, bacon, toast & coffee??? Seriously???
Other than that the hotel was clean and the room was clean and well kept for guests.
I would recommend it for folks who are not in town on business.",3.0,3
"High Class Boutique Hotel
XV Beacon Hotel (Fifteen Beacon) is a luxurious boutique hotel on the top of Beacon Hill in Boston. Walking distance to shops, parks and restaurants (everything is walking distance in Boston), this hotel is situated 15 minutes from Boston Logan BOS Airport (approx. $22 taxi fare). 
The hotel is a 1903 landmark building with the charm of historic Boston but with the comfort of chic, classic and modern facilities. With only 63 rooms in the entire hotel, XV Beacon hotel feels like a home away from home, with friendly and helpful staff at the front desk and concierge. Each room has a cozy feeling including your own gas fireplace. We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last five years and even during our recent visit the service and quality remains superior.
During our May visit we stayed in room 404 (which happened to be the largest suite on that floor) - each floor only has seven guest rooms. Opt for one of the Beacon Hill Studio's you won't regret it - including either a Queen or King Bed, gas fireplace, large flat screen TV, large sitting area, and fabulous bathroom.
One other great feature at XV Beacon is their complimentary in-town Lexus car service. The hotel has one Sedan and one SUV that can accommodate either 2 or 4 passengers. Service is available on a first come-first serve basis; however if you know you are headed somewhere specific during your stay you can pencil in your time and location with the concierge. This is a fantastic service since taxi's are not that easy to find in Boston, and not as affordable as they are in NYC. Be sure to take advantage of this service during your stay.",5.0,5
"Rooms are OK, but PARKING IS A BIG PROBLEM.
Approx. 300 parking spaces, but 280 seem to be permanently full. Don't stay here if you need handicap parking close to the front door. They have only 6 handicap spaces, and all 6 are always full, so our handicapped driver had to park 300 feet away. The noisy & crowded complimentary breakfast was disappointing: powered eggs, rubbery sausage, & waffle irons that take 5 minutes. Instead, go for the brand-name cereal packs. Four elevators, but they all have different control panels which is confusing to the casual visitor, especially the elevator that doesn't have a button for Lobby (you have to select Floor 1)!! Don't expect to find a luggage cart if you need one either. Sleep quality: halls are noisy and mattresses are saggy. Hallways are 87 degrees with no AC. This hotel is a lot of work, for a higher than average price. Won't stay there again.",2.0,2
"Amazing 'little' hotel
When we arrived here the location and hotel was very unassuming, after having spent 4 nights earlier in the week in Times Sq itself. But once we got to our rooms all that changed.
This place has the feel of a smell hotel. Check-in was painless - we asked for a nice view and we got more than we bargained for. A room on the 31st floor overlooking Empire State and Macy's. The hotel has been refurbished and everything is spotless. The microwave came in handy when we ate in. Just a few blocks south of Times Sq but still a buzzing part of the city. Across the road from Macy's(shop till you drop) and countless other stores. Herald Sq was a lovely surprise(little park with tables to watch people go by, the bell tolled every hour). 
Peter the consierge was amazing. Helped with places to eat and things to do.
The room was a little cramped but not a problem as we spent most of the time out in the city. Extremely comfy beds and showers and bathroom amenities.
Also literally out the front door is the subway to get to anywhere in NYC - very convenient. Walking distance to Curry Hill and the many eateries.
The continental breakfast was also very reasonable ,convenient and hearty. Just enough to get you started in the morning.
Overall an amazing stay in a more afforable hotel, in a top location. Its high rating on TA is justifiable.",5.0,5
"If you want to change your own sheets (or sleep on dirty ones) stay here
What a disappointment. I stayed for two nights while attending a conference at the convention center. Great location near Little Italy and a block from the green line trolley (3 quick stops to the convention center). Amtrak runs along the same tracks, though so you will get some train noise, which I didn't mind. Also a pretty easy bus ride from the airport puts you two blocks from the hotel.
The hotel is actually a motel. The bed was reasonably comfortable. My problem: housekeeping. My room was not super clean, and the carpet was persistently damp for some reason. The tub was grimy and the shower head sprayed out onto the floor. Not great. 
But the sheets really got to me. No critters--I checked--but my sheets in room 105 were grey and streaked with what looked like bike grease. There was also a tear in the sheet. I endured the first night, hung the Maid Please Clean room placard on the knob and returned latish my second night. I fold open the bed to find the same sheets. I go to the office where a night evening desk clerk apologizes and says he'll make it right. Making it right was arriving at my door with two sheets (which he said he wasn't sure were the right size) and he walked away. Now that is why I stay in a hotel: so I can make the bed. I had to go back to get clean pillowcases. Oh, the evening guy assured me he would ""log it in my report."" Wow.
The next morning when I checked out the morning clerk so gee, sorry, I will be sure to tell housekeeping. Wow, again. People are nice enough but they don't do a bloody thing.",2.0,2
"Excellence in all areas
The Kimpton hotels continue to impress me where ever I go. The Chicago Palomar is just outstanding. Very good restaurant, location, and service. I particularly liked the exercise facility (rowing machine a real plus and a rare find in a hotel gym); the work space and swivel chair; the accessible power outlets; and the IHome for docking Ipod. The high definition plasma flat screen was first rate, and the wireless access was easy and had a strong connection (obvs free for Kimpton In Touch members).
Overall, this may be the finest Kimpton property I have had the pleasure to stay at, and I highly recommend it.",5.0,5
"Very good location
This was a Birthday treat for my hubby and as we checked in he was wished a Happy Birthday from the staff. There was a huge cup cake and a card relaying a Birthday wish for him so that was a lovely start to our holiday here. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the Hotel nice and clean and the rooms very comfortable. I think we could have slept 4 in our bed it was so big!! Breakfast is pretty good with quite a nice selection of hot & cold foods and drinks etc. As said in another review it is best to get to breakfast early, to avoid the crowds and get back in the lifts with no hold up. The paper cups and plates etc are not really a problem, although plastic knives & forks aren't so good but generally you just accept this. A glass each in the room would have been nice though as we do tend to have a drink before and after going out in the evenings. The location of the Hotel is brilliant. Between 8th and 9th it was central for everywhere. 9th Ave is good for finding restaurants etc, Times square and Broadway, beyond for Central Park, Grand Central, Rockerfellas, and Empire State were all within 20 mins or less to walk. We walked down to the river, and it wasn't too much longer. (The aircraft carrier museum is good to see there, much more than it looks from outside including a submarine visit and concorde too (at an extra cost)) It is very easy to take the underground downtown to the ferries and boats. Pier 17 is a good place to catch the hop on hop off tour which takes you up the river and back and you get a good look at the Statue of Liberty etc. Remember to ask for tickets to see the 9/11 memorial, you can get off and view the pools put up in memory of all that died. A very nice way to remember them. We didn't see any options for getting tickets at the site.
Talking of ease. From the Airport, we took the air train from JFK terminal 8 (the train stops at all terminals) just 2 stops, and then took the long island train which took us to block 33/34. (Depending on where you come out!) We were staying at block 42 so just 10 - 15 mins, if that, easy walk and you are at your Hotel. We had thought about a transport bus, although reviews were not good with them, or getting the Hotel to arrange transport, but as it was SO easy and less expensive, we opted for the same going back. Considering it was rush hour when we did so, it was still remarkably good. There are helpful staff at the stations too if you come unstuck. If buying you tickets for the air train on your return from a machine, beware some of them only give a max $6 change. We needed 2 $5 dollar tickets and only had a $20 so it would have effectively cost us $14!! If there is a staff member there selling what appear to be tout tickets, as long as he has the official jacket on he is official. We got out tickets from him no problem. It only takes 25/30 mins to do the whole train journeys, the courtesy bus can take up to 1 1/2 hrs in traffic.
Back to the Hotel, we would stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Don't forget to grab a cookie of the desk when you are checking in, they are cool.",4.0,4
"EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED from Debra Lane
Staff gave super service from front door thru entire stay. Housekeeping very helpful with our erratic college graduation schedule. Spent much more of our dining budget at this hotel than we planned as the food was excellent, prices were competitive and service was friendly, efficient but not an overkill. Staff even helped with parking. Pool and all public areas were immaculate and room was high-end comfort. at an affordable price, No problems - all pleasure.

"""Great location...not so great accommodations""
This hotel is just average. They are renovating it,however, they have quite a ways to go before it will be above average. The rooms are small so when you have the heat on (even on low) it knocks you out of the room. The room had a musty smell when we first went in, however, that went away. The door for the closet hits the wall so you can't open it all the way. The same with the bathroom door it hits the toilet and also the fan didn't work in the bathroom. The telephone in our room didn't work. The entry light blinked off and on when you left it on. We had to pay for wi-fi which didn't work very well at times. We didn't have a ""Do Not Disburb"" sign for our room. We didn't even know our maid's name. On one of the elevators the button for our floor never lit up however it did stop at our floor. The elevators were very slow. Our room came with the American Breakfast Buffet, we found this to be just ok.The maids carts were left in the hallway every night . The hallway is very small it barely fit two people side by side. However the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our train wasn't leaving until 2:00 p.m. and they let us stay in the room until 1:00 p.m. at no charge. It was okay for our short stay for 2 -3 days, however, if you were planning to stay longer I would not stay here.",3.0,3
"Go down the street!
I travel a lot for work and this is the worst hotel I have been in. The rooms were nasty dirty, the internet was spotty and we actually had to move rooms because of it. The staff was rude, aside from the cleaners who were upset because their manager told them to bring in their own cleaning supplies. The breakfast had no selection to be considerded a continental breakfast. On top of that the manager over charged me by $10 per night on my credit card. Honestly I would have been more comfortable and had less hassle sleeping on the street.",1.0,1
"Horrible, dingy, only plus is location
Avoid this hotel. It is run down and dingy! Bar is dark and has no air conditioning! Our room was horrible, we complained and they upgraded all three of our rooms to premium, which made it moderately possible to stay in. Room ac is horrible. No frig, no coffee maker. I would not recommend this hotel. Better to stay right across the street at the Double Tree, or up the street one block at the Crown Plaza. This hotel $189 located right on Time Square, let's just say you get what you paid for.",1.0,1
"Never Again Will I Stay Here - Horrible Hyatt
I should have learned my lesson. Every year in March I attend a meeting held here. I usually stay around the corner at the Fairmont or just up the street at the Swiss Hotel. For some reason this year I forgot how horrible this Hyatt is. Here is a summary:
1. Failure to honor a reservation. Even though a special room was requested at time of reservation and even though i called the afternoon I was to arrive to verify that special room request, when I arrived at 6:30 pm, the room was not available. ""There is nothing we can do, we are full.""
2. When I arrived in the room (6th floor West Tower) the room reeked of cigarette smoke -- really?? Yes, really, even in 2012. And those f you who have had this know that nothing can be done. I did call -- I told my story and then was sent to a second person to tell the entire story a second time -- the first offer was, ""we will have housekeeping come and spray."" Of course those of us who travel frequently know this will not work. Then ""if you can leave the room for a couple of hours, we can put a machine in there."" Leave the room? Not possible then - certainly the next day. ""Well, we could buy you dinner and then you could return to the room. Again, I had work to do, not time to sit alone for two hours in a restaurant waiting for the room to be de-odorized. And of course, they were full. NOTHING could be done.
3. Room service -- the first night -- to begin with, I was on hold for 15 minutes -- at 9 pm and then I ordered tomato soup, a reuben with fruit as the side choice and a glass of chianti. Ten minutes later i was called and told they did not serve the tomato soup any more and it should not have been on the menu. I was offered tortilla soup. Five minutes later called to be told they were out of tortilla soup (it was St Patrick's Day and they offered me Irish stew) - I chose the chicken soup. And yes, there was one more call. 15 minutes later I was called and told that I had an old menu and that they did not serve the chianti by the glass any more. Well, that was quite an experience.
4. Bell service - simply put, when they have a large convention, do not expect any bell service unless you are willing to wait 30-40 minutes for it. Enough said.
I could go further but this is already too long. I stayed at the Fairmont for the rest of my stay. Thank goodness.
And later in the week I get to go to Dallas where there is a great Hyatt. never again for this one.",1.0,1

"Luxurious...but troublesome
I stayed at the Chatwal earlier this year for about a few weekdays.
I came to the door, my bags were taken up. I believe I was SPG Gold at this point - anyhow, availability was low and I was put into a standard room that overlooked 44th. The front desk was kind and welcoming. However, no one took me up to my room which I usually don't mind, but more on that below.
In the room - the feel is that of uber luxury - the Great Gatsby/ Roaring 20s theme really jumps out - the attention to detail is meticulous. Now, the lighting, blinds, tv, and toilet in the room were all extremely confusing. It would have been nice if someone were to walk me through everything. I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out both the console/ phone and their magic toilet which apparently is a heated seat with all sorts of other features. Turns out that mine was actually broken. 
Anyhow, I had called and asked for a charger for my phone - it never came. I had to call back a second time - this time my butler picked up and brought it. The woman who picked up the first time was extremely rude and sour. Anyways, the bed is AMAZING. Probably the best bed I've ever slept in.
Anyways, the next morning as I'm getting ready, I asked for an iron and an ironing board. The same woman from yesterday picked up. I waited 15 minutes before deciding to just hop into the shower. Wasn't there when I got back, had to call again, wait 10 more minutes and my butler brought it. Luckily I didn't need to be anywhere exactly at 8:30 but if I had, that would have been a huge problem.
When I returned, I mentioned these points along w/ the dysfunctional electronics to the woman at the front desk. She was very understanding, asked if I knew who picked up the phone both times (I didn't) and offered to move my room to a suite with a terrace. She also sent up 2 $40 certificates to use in their restaurant/bar. I appreciated that of course. The 2nd room was even better obviously! The terrace was fantastic - very private with a lot of large plants around. It was a warm day in NYC with light drizzling.
This room had a functioning toilet with all the gadgets. I would also like to mention that the showers are GREAT (rain showers), although the sinks are a bit odd. Overall probably the most luxurious room I've been in (really just something you have to see for yourself).
Additionally, I used the gym once while there - it's tiny, just a few cardio machines and some yoga balls with a short rack of dumbells. Disappointing - wasn't able to try the pool.
Also, never ordered any food either. Overall....it's nice, but the price tag is rather hefty, I'm not sure I'd opt to stay there too often over a place like the Trump SoHo unless I needed to be in midtown.",3.0,3

We went to DC to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We selected The Jefferson based on some of the other reviews and were very glad that we did.

"Big Disappointment
I took my wife to Graceland for the 2012 birthday celebrations as one of her Christmas presents, and although we both enjoyed the Graceland Experience, we were shocked at the poor quality of the hotel and its front desk staff. The room was supposed to be non-smoking, but there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke. The room had no vetilation and was way too hot. There were chips out of door jambs, the washroom fixtures-everywhere you looked, it was very tired. The front desk staff had no idea about any scheduled events at Graceland and didn't even know where Club Elvis was located, and there were not interested in helping us-they were too lazy.
We checked out early and went to another hotel-it was like going from darkness to light-the difference in accommodation and staff friendliness was that better at the new hotel.
We will never stay there again, and my wife is a member of ""Elvis Insiders"".",1.0,1

The service was excellent, the wait staff surberb and the rooms were great. At night we did not need to turn on the TV since we had an excellent view of the city lights of Boston. Getting there was easy. Taking a water taxi from the Marriott made it easy. The water taxi ride was fantastic. Great views of the city from the water. Getting back to south station via the silver line was free. What a hotel discovery.",5.0,5
"Not family friendly
Nice, clean boutique hotel, but wasn't overly impressed.
Cons -
Parking for our SUV, which we were told wouldn't fit in the underground parking, was $40 a night. The front desk staff and bellmen seemed a bit bothered, although it would be that we were there over Thanksgiving....maybe they didn't want to be there. In general, I didn't feel like it was a family friendly hotel, but more of a place for business travelers. 
Pros -
Clean rooms, good closet space, safe area of town. It is walkable to the White House. I think my GPS said .9 mile and we had 3 kids under 8 walk it with us. 
However, there weren't really any perks to coming back if we were in the area again. Based on our pre-trip research, we'd probably pick a different hotel since they seem to all be within the same price range. Also, considering no complimentary breakfast is offered, we'd consider staying somewhere closer to a coffee shop.",3.0,3
"Very disappointed.
As a young traveler I had stayed in several cheap American hotels and hostels before my time at the Hyatt. They seem determined to squeeze every penny they can on top of the exorbitant price for average rooms. I called their tech department after purchasing wifi on my laptop - $9.95 for 24 hours - to find out how to extend it to my phone as I needed to be in contact with family. I was told that I needed to purchase the $14.95 package on top of what I had already payed to have the internet on more than one device. A relatively small issue in retrospect but I was upset by how money-hungry the entire place seemed when I had previously stayed in nice, clean places for $40 a night with unlimited internet access and in-room amenities such as a refrigerator which costs $25 to have at the Hyatt. I also witnessed many families and younger people being treated with noticeably less respect by staff than the businesspeople around the hotel. I will save my money next time and find somewhere cheaper that knows how to treat every customer well.",1.0,1
"Good night's sleep at a good value.
I was in Chicago to attend a week long meeting. I stayed at the Inn of Chicago because the meeting hotel could not book me a room for the entire length of my stay. I was given a very good rate through a website. The front desk was friendly and assigned me my requested upgrade to a king bed on the 10th floor. The room was quiet because it overlooked the back of the hotel and not the streets on either side of its corner location. The room was larger than many I have stayed in at newer hotels .a The bathroom was small. but serviceable. The room had a flat screen TV and the bed was quite comfortable. The hotel was only 1 block fro Michigan Ave. and about 4 blocks from my meeting hotel with a variety of nearby breakfast places e.g. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. The staff seemed uncertain whether I would receive points for my stay from Choice hotels because i booked through the website. They said it was Expedia althought I booked through EasytoBook.com . They could also not give me a receipt for my stay which I may need to receive reimnbursement through my job.",4.0,4
"Great Hotel
We took the BART from San Francisco airport to the Powell St. Bart Station and walked 4 blocks to the Chancellor - stayed 4 nights 
Outside is quite quaint but elegant, inside the lobby very nice with large couch, and some antique chairs, table with ice water with lemon and a tray of cookies (all the time) - a nice extra treat. Free coffee x 24 hrs. 
Rooms were small but very comfy beds, clean linens and huge tub which I really liked also bath salts were supplied and a rubber Ducky - cute idea.
We asked for a fridge in the room and it was delivered right away. No air conditioning but it wasn't needed in San Fran - we just ,opened the windows. Some reviews said it was noisy but we never heard much being tired from walking most of the day. Cable car was nearby but was always busy and there were line ups to get on so we walked and took taxis most of the time . Happy hour in the bar was great with great service. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Have the eggs benedict in Luques restaurant on site - they were yummy. Everything is close shopping ,dining ,even China Town was in walking distance . So we were so glad we read the reviews and decided to stay at the Chancellor. We would stay there again!.",5.0,5
"Nostalgic Elegance
As soon as you enter the Drake, you know your experience there will be special. The elegant design and style takes you back in time. The lobby greets you with a grand bouquet of fresh flowers and beautiful chandeliers. My room was large and the bed was comfortable. My meal from room service was exquisite. The staff were very courteous and friendly. The location is perfect for upscale shopping on North Michigan Avenue and near Rush Street for an exciting night life. I would definitely stay there again !",5.0,5
"No hot water
The hotel is stylish and in a convenient location. Unfortunately, there was no hot water in the shower and the toilet didn't flush properly. I was only staying one night so had no opportunity to be moved to another room. Upon checkout, I informed the front desk staff who took 20% off my bill. I was in NY for work and said that I planned to come back for a long weekend later in the summer with my spouse and had hoped the Dream would be a hotel we could return to, but I couldn't chance that the next time there might still be plumbing problems. The staff smiled and nodded. Had they seemed apologetic or assured me this was unusual and wouldn't happen again, I might have considered staying there again. Although they did give me a discount, they didn't seem concerned whether I stayed there again or not, so I will not.",2.0,2

I stayed at the Extended Stay Westchase for 2 months while in Houston on business. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and up to date. The office staff is amazing. They are very friendly and welcoming and will do anything within their means to make your stay enjoyable. I didn't have a single complaint or issue in 2 months. My room/credit card charges were always correct, there was never excessive noise, trash, or unsavory characters. The area is safe and all shopping and eating is very convienent. You will be pleased!",5.0,5
"Damned by faint praise
Before you read any more of my review, please do not think I have rated the Warwick as ""Average"" in a bad way. It was a great base for our trip, being located on 6th Ave (hence only 1 block from 5th avenue shopping and 2 blocks from Broadway and all the shows). There are lots (and I do mean LOTS!) of choices to eat nearby - we chose not to eat in the hotel for any meals as we wanted the opportunity to sample New York properly.
As for the hotel itself, it was comfortable, although the heating took some getting used to. The room (2608) was a decent size, although the view was restricted - but, for me, part of the experience of New York was being amongst the skyscrapers. The bathroom was small (think Travellodge) but adequate. The beds were VERY comfortable and the TV gave you access to more than you will possibly want, although we hardly watched anything (too much to see & do).
On a negative note, the decor was a bit ""tired"" and could do with a revamp, but it was clean and housekeeping looked after us well enough. There were no coffee-making facilities in the room but a coffee maker was provided on request with no fuss.
Generally, staff were pleasant and helpful, although in truth the only request we made of them was to get us a cab to the airport when it came trime to leave
We tried the bar on our first day and were rewarded with a pleasant environment & pleasant staff
All in all, I would stay here again and would recommend it, as it makes an excellent base to explore Manhattan
Maybe ""Average"" is a little too harsh after all",3.0,3

"Avoid it
This was one of 6 hotels stayed at during the past 2 weeks travelling round the states. One night in NYC staying heree and that was enough. I checked in late evening after a long flight (and the lady was very pleasent. She put me on the ""concierge floor"", which I thought intimated something special - the bags of rubbish and old housekeeping laundry still hanging about the corridor was not impressive. The room was a decent size but thats where it collapsed. Tiles were cracking off the walls in the bathroom and the hanging space minimal. It was 95 degrees and the AC was an antiquated metal box under the window which howled during the night. - a choice between too hot to sleep or too loud to sleep.
Check out was an experience. The first person (Frank on the name badge) just told me to go away and get back to wait until he was ready. His collegue (lady with frizzy hair) had a ""I couldnt give a ....."" attitude when I mentioned the issues. Apparantly there was no "" concierge floor"" so I have no idea why I was told this. It was obvious that paying guests were really nothing more than an inconvenience. The final straw was the $3.75 plus service for the hotel to hold my bag for 4 hours.
Not a place I will rush back to, and I cant even give the excuse that ""Its cheap so you get what you pay for"" - $300 plus all the taxes is not cheap!!
The only good point is that its in a good mid town location - but there are lots of other better places to stay -

"Poor showing for Yotel
I stayed at Yotel on 7/18 and the experience was lackluster. I was in ""cabin"" 2337 and although I checked in during the dinner hour, I quickly left for dinner and did not return until after midnight. **The city was near one hundred degrees this week.** When returning to the cabin the room was in the high 80s. I figured it was part of the ""green"" approach to the place so I did not think much of it, turned the AC down to 70 and quickly went to sleep. By 3:00am I awoke in a pool of sweat, went to the AC controls and found that the room had not cooled below 78 degrees. In addition, when I went to the bathroom to get a cool towel, the lights in the bathroom did not work. I then went for the light in the cabin entryway...no luck there either. The only lights that worked were near the bed and they provided no light into the bathroom.
The next morning I went to the fourth floor lobby to checkout and mentioned my problems to the desk staff. One of them asked me in an attitude if I had called the desk staff about the AC problem. I let her know that at 3:00am I didn't consider that an option. The other employee curtly asked me my cabin number and neither of them offered so much as an apology for the experience.
Staying at Yotel saved my company $50-75 but it was not worth it. Next time I'll be a slightly less, good corporate citizen and stay at a Hilton or Marriott.",2.0,2
"Not my first choice
My plans for NY last month included a suite at the Salisbury Hotel on W57th St, but of course, with a broken crane hanging 60 floors above, that was impossible (and a bit disappointing). After many phone calls, I was lucky to get a room about 12 streets away at the Milford Plaza. The hotel was enormously crowded as I arrived, with huge queues at reception and in all public areas. My room, when I finally got to it, was very tiny, but on a corner (which I very much like) and was in fact very quiet. The bed was great and the bathroom worked well. The staff were very busy at all times - a few days after ""Sandy"" that is understandable, but they were helpful and courteous. I could still walk easily enough to all my concerts etc at Lincoln Center, so in the end I was happy enough - and realise now, several weeks later, that I was lucky to be there at all, with electricity and water when so many locals were doing it really tough. Maybe next time I will get to my suite at the Salisbury...",3.0,3
"Sophisticated, Friendly & Fun
Staying at The Bowery Hotel was a treat. It was pricey, but I enjoyed my visit immensely and recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. The room was immaculate: clean, bright and welcoming, with lovely views of the East Village. The hotel remains faithful to its period architecture and design, without sacrificing any modern amenities. It was so quiet in the mornings, but in the evenings the absolutely gorgeous main areas were bustling with activity. Every member of the staff I encountered was attentive and very friendly. The location is ideal for exploring the East & West Villages, NoHo, SoHo, etc. The only complaint I had was less than perfect service at adjoining restaurant Gemma: while the food and atmosphere was delightful, I felt rushed to order (brunch). Our waitress hovered, as if waiting for us to finish, but ignored our empty coffee cups. With so many wonderful eateries within a short walk, The Bowery should work a little harder to make Gemma their hotel guests’ dining destination.",5.0,5

My first impression from the street was great. But upon getting to room not so good. The bed was worn out years past. I think I would been better to sleep outside on the ground. Went to the front office and they just said ""Nothing we can do""

Usually I find the Super 8 facilities to be great. This one seemed to be fine also except for our particular room. There were no trash cans (none), no bath mat, only two towels, just three pillows on 2 queen beds (at least there were only three of us), The toilet paper wouldn't even stay on the rollers in the bathroom due to their size. This is very unusual. In fact, I am in another Super 8 right now for another 3 nights, and things are fine here. It must have been an anomaly.",3.0,3
"Dana - Okay but a few flaws
Took the grand kids for a three night stay; booked a ""view"" room but only had a view of the pool for two nights so beware you will not get an ocean view. The location is fabulous on the Mission Bay; walking distance to Seaworld and beaches. Landscaping was a nice tropical theme and well maintained. 
Two sides of this property (we stayed on both sided); the older size only has smaller rooms - no room for a roll away bed in our two queen room. The older units have the old school window A/C units - which worked fine but a bit noisy. They appear to have been recently remodeled. Pool on the old side was a nice size but had a clogged drain - they didn't fix it the two days we were on this side - could have been a slip hazard. The new side has the larger ocean view rooms with twice the room . We actually had more problems on the new side - pull out couch had a broken spring and the handle fell off the sink. They did give us a discount on our bill to make it right - which was nice. 
The pool on the ""new"" side was fabulous and attached to a bar. We had drinks, food and appetizers from the bar - the bruschetta was great - and chicken strips for the kids - hum. 
So we had a good trip overall - they just need to focus on some maintenance issues to make it great.",3.0,3

"Avoid it - no matter how good the price is.
My boyfriend and I stayed here while traveling to San Antonio. It was a huge mistake! The bed sheets were stained and when we asked for new ones, they gave us more that were stained. The pillows were also gross - so gross that I put a t-shirt around the pillow so there was another layer between me and that nasty pillow. 
The remote in our room didn't work so we called the front desk from the room. It rang and rang and rang. They not only couldn't give us a working remote but also neglected to tell us (when we walked to the front office since the didn't answer) that their phones were broken. 
This is not the kind of Ramada you'd expect with the name brand associated. It's more like a Howard Johnson. 
In the morning we wanted to speak to the manager but the person on staff said for us to wait about 3 hours until the actual manager showed up for work. We didn't bother waiting. They didn't care how our stay was. Such a disappointing experience for such a fun city like San Antonio.",1.0,1

"rooms old fashioned not impressed
We stayed at the comfort inn manhatten after travelling down from Rhode island after our wedding, so this 4 night stay was part of our honeymoon , we had a family room, with 2 double beds as we had 10 and 7 yr old sons with us. on first access to the room on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel the room was really smelly ,. like a musty damp , old smell, we werent impressed with the decor as it was extremely old fashioned and didnt look clean, the windows were filthy and the road noise was terrible, I dont think it could have been double glazed and if it was it was not good quality. We complained and asked if there was another room away from the main road and that was more refurbished, we were then given room 1206 which on entrance didnt smell old and damp , however the decor was the same. on closer inspection the carpet wasnt the cleanest and we quickly told our children not to play on the floor , my husband found hairs in the bed, and the window again wasnt the cleanest. We also had a door which was locked which would have given access to another bedroom, on an evening you could hear people sneezing and talking the soundproofing was that bad. we just decided we would have to accept this room as we presumed all would be the same. We were told by the receptionist that the virgin holiday rep would be in the restaurant the following day between 8-9am we would get a hot breakfast and then for the rest of the holiday we would get a continental breakfast, when we got downstairs at 8.45, the rep had gone and there was no hot breakfast, when I asked them to look into this, they werent very helpful. the breakfast left a lot to be desired, donuts and bagels , no fresh fruit and plastic knifes that you couldnt use to spread they were that weak, how ridiculous that they have purchased the cheapest plastic knifes that are not even strong enough to spread... when I asked them for different cutlery the waiter didnt understand what I was asking so I gave up as a bad job. we only had the continental breakfast once our of our 4 nights and chose to eat out. The other annoying point is that the lifts take forever and one was out of service on our last day which took us 20 mins to get from floor 12 to the bottom as the only lift that was working was also faulty and stopped of on each floor taking us down even though noone was waiting, if it hadnt been for our luggage we would have taken the steps. we had a great time in new york and the location is great for this hotel however we would never return to this dated hotel. The concierge guy on the door was helpful and looked after our luggage when we checked out, however the receptionists were the friendliest and the overall appearance of the rooms, windows, cleanliness, carpets, etc was not up to standard.",2.0,2

"Terrible
Parking costs an additional $38.00, that's if you can't find parking on the street, which is rare. That's the welcome we received. The check in process was simple and to the point. We happen to have gotten upgraded to a higher floor which was nice, the 8th floor. FYI- do not place room key in your wallet. Once you do it automatically demagnetizes therefore your access to the elevator is compromised not to mention your room you paid for. Taking a ride up and down the elevator was not fun. Then the evening came. 
 We arrived on Saturday, October 27th which I know now is a big Halloween evening for San Diego. Which is fine it's just that I didn't realize we would be right across from the Halloween block party that did not end till 12:30am. Pounding music. Then the nightclub that is on the 9th floor began. That lasted till about 4:45am. I didn't get a wink of sleep till 5am. I don't recommend this hotel. It is simple not elegant but basic.

"Room smelled like vomit - would give zero stars if I could
I generally agree with the prior reviews complaining about how dated the rooms are and how the rooms reeked of smoke, except the junior suite we stayed in smelled like vomit rather than smoke. It was so bad that it made us sick and we actually decided to leave the hotel rather than take another room for the night. The hallways are not much better. This hotel is a total, overpriced disaster. Having lived in Manhattan, I know full well how expensive things are there, but it is as if this hotel goes out of its way to encourage you not to spend money there-e.g., $11 for a bagel/cream cheese...really? Customer service is phony and poor - check-in took an absurdly long time, and our bags arrived in our room hours after we arrived. Lobby would be ok, but the hordes of people streaming through the lobby at seemingly all hours negates any positives that you might attribute to the lobby. Location is ok, but that would generally be the case with any of the midtown hotels. There are MUCH better options in NYC at this price point. I'd definitely look elsewhere.",1.0,1

"Comfortable, clean and well located but very small room
Primary concern staying in NYC was that the hotel should be clean and bug free - this one was. It was spotlessly clean and nicely air-conditioned. Staff were quick to respond to any problems and the hotel is only one block from the red 1 line and 2 avenues over from the blue and orange line. We found it a handy base for seeing New York. 
Downsides were that the room was TINY. When we looked at the fire escape plan beside the lift it did seem like we literally got the smallest room on the floor - there was barely enough space to walk around the bed, none if you decided to put your luggage down, so it did require extreme tidyness or you'd be tripping over yourself. That said, it was fully formed in that it had a double bed, 2 bedside lockers, En Suite, TV and a small wardrobe in it.
Overall a good experience that I would recommend. Think it cost us about €140 a night on average. One thing I will say is that there should have been a guest information packet in the room. A bit odd that there wasn't!",3.0,3

Breakfast was included but had very little choice - Danish pastries, orange juice and coffee with coffee mate, no milk. There was no where to sit so had to take it back to the room to sit on the bed.

After staying at this location on several occasions I have decided that the quality is questionable.

Being a forgiving person, I returned on March 28,2012 for another stay and as I was settling into bed to watch television, there was a very large sized cockroach crawling on the wall. I killed the bug and gave it to staff, as it was indicated by the staff that the manager had been told of a problem before and didn't believe it. Well here is proof in the pudding. I was then moved to another room where the room reeked of cheap perfume, the television was fuzzy and the remote control did not work. I spent the all night minus 1 hour sitting up looking for other creepy crawlies. I had a non-refundable room that was booked in advance so I was worried about losing my money.

"Terrible Breakfast, unclean and uncomfortable
Not sure where these other reviewers have stayed in the past, but I chose this place in part on the reviews and I was completely misinformed. The breakfast was terrible, the eggs completely inedible. A ""hot breakfast"" was advertised, but the only items hot were the fore mentioned eggs and pigs in the blanket that were too inedible as they were hard as a rock. Everything else available was a typical hotel breakfast for which we had much better at a much cheaper hotel the day before in New Braunfels.
They did not have our reservation when we arrived due to booking with hotels.com. Well if you can't communicate with those you advertise with then don't advertise with them. This caused our check in to take an additional 20 minutes or so and with already tired and traveled kids this is a big problem. 
The first room A/C did not work and the room was 80 degrees upon arrival. They did send keys to a new room immediately.
The carpet in the halls were appalling. The bathtub was dirty or stained not sure which. All in all, I felt cheated. Never have reviews let me down so badly.

"Not quite what I expected
My husband and I recently visited San Francisco as a part of our ""Anniversamoon"". We spent 3 nights in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. The lobby is stunning, and our Concierge Lief was amazing in assisting us with all that San Fran has to offer including sight-seeing, dining, and attractions. 
I was very displeased with the room being that it was extremely small and the bathroom was the size of a hall closet, my poor husband had to sit sideways on the tiolet. The walls in the bedroom are paper thin, and I couldn't sleep with all the hustle & bustle of the street noise.
My biggest complaint is that the hotel charges $57.00 a day for parking. We parked at the stockton gargage and even though it was a short distance, it was still a hassle carrying all of our belongings. Just a heads up, it was still $34.00 a night to park there.",3.0,3

This past weekend we stayed at Embassy Suites. I have decided due to the amount of other hotels in the area we won't be returning. The hotel has good points- the two rooms and it ends at about that. This is the second time staying here that an elevator quit working-even if they are all working they are the slowest in town. The keys did not work twice to our rooms and no they were not next to cell phones or credit cards. The food area is a disaster-kind of dirty and really unorganized. The lighting in the bathroom (generally the whole room) is so bad you have to sit next to a floor length mirror in the bedroom to apply makeup. We were also put on the second floor which is very loud beginning at 6 in the am. We thought we would give this hotel another chance but not again.

just a one nite stay, its ok, room product is hip and modern, but sort of annoyingly so. there is nothing to eat in this area, except a Ruby Tuesday across the street which was filthy.
staff at desk are fine, hi, checking in, heres your key. The little fridge at the desk has sandwiches in it, which work in a pinch. bottom line, you will survive a night.",3.0,3
"Incompetent, unclean, and boring
Had problems checking in and out, and in between. But first, don’t believe the hype on this hotel’s website. This hotel is near nothing. The restaurants and clubs listed as “nearby” are elsewhere in Denver, but you will need transportation. It’s a long walk to the train, despite the claim for it being near. Long walk to a busy intersection, then under a set of interstate bridges. There were homeless people under the bridges asking for a handout. 
Check in was a miserable experience with an incompetent clerk that could not understand a simple question regarding a company credit card. Three times she left and came back with answers that were irrelevant junk. Finally talked to some chubby manager that was equally clueless—didn’t even bother to check, just said “no” when he finally grasped my question. I had to use a personal card, and then was punished with the noisiest room with a view of the front parking lot—the clerk even bragged to my face that she was sticking me in that room for making her “look bad” in front of the manager. 
Tried twice over the next three days to resolve the CC issue, each time met with indifference and incompetence at the front desk. Another thirty minutes to check out and still wound up with spurious charges on my personal card. Seriously, this hotel is staffed by untrained workers that are indifferent and clueless.
The entire place is filthy. The hallway carpet was covered with the same debris (leaves, threads, glitter, paper and other detritus) the entire four days I was there. A cigarillo butt was in one hall corner the entire time. Hard to miss, but who knows how long it’s sat there. A partially eaten box lunch sat next to the trash can near the elevator for an entire day and evening. Which explains the bugs. Ceilings in the hall and in the bathroom were cheap hanging industrial acoustical tiles, many were stained. I’ve never been in a Motel 6, but I’m betting this is the way they look inside. I had bugs in the bathroom, not surprising with a filthy hall and loose ceiling tiles. They never cleaned the in-room coffee service all the time I was there, and only provide decaf unless you beg (three mornings, then I gave up; had to ask for condiments and shampoo as well). Room walls so thin you could hear every conversation in adjacent rooms. I did visit a guest room on the west side that had mountain views-- across multiple lanes of interstate traffic. We could barely hear ourselves without raising our voices over the roar of the traffic. So much for scenery. 
There was a refrigerator in the room. No place in walking distance to buy anything. Believe it or not, in this “classy” place one of the cabinet doors for the ‘fridge and fallen off and they never bothered repairing it, just left it partially open with half its doors. The mini ‘fridge had an ice ball around the freezer compartment-- hadn’t been cleaned or defrosted in months. It wasn’t cold inside and it buzzed and groaned constantly. Yet they list this piece of junk as an “amenity” in the hotel room description—what a farce. 
Finally, (not really done with all that I dislike about this place, but I’ve spent enough time on this hole) the restaurant (glorified snack bar) and in-room dining are mediocre and way overpriced. This hotel is one of the worse deals, ever. Avoid.",1.0,1
"Worst Hotel EVER!!!! PLEASE DON'T STAY THERE!
This is worst hotel I have ever stayed in my entire life. The room is dirty, the bed is super unfortable, the location is filled with homeless people. When I reviewed my bank statement, they charged me $50.00 in additional to the room fees for no reason. I learned my lesson, and I would rather to pay $200 dollars more to say at anywhere else than this [--] place!!!",1.0,1
"An average/slightly above average hotel, good location.
Staying two nights over the labor day weekend. The location is very good. If you walk past the hotel away from Union Square, those city blocks are not the nicest part of town with homeless and some sketchy people. I don't feel any dangers in particular but you have to have common sense as walking in any other big cities. The hotel is huge. Check in was quick about 5 mins. The lobby as other reviewers said is gigantic. It makes me feel like I'm in a train terminal. Personally I don't like it but it doesn't matter to me much. I don't spend lots of time in the lobby anyway. I got a room in the tower 3. Room is good and better than average. I wouldn't call it a 4 star even though it's listed as 4 star on travel websites. I've stayed better at Westin and Omni. The room size is about right, not too big not too small. Bathroom is decent size with shower and no tub. Toileteries are Peter Thomas Roth which is a nice touch. The bed is good and comfortable. I slept well. Since the hotel is huge, there'll be a good great mix of people who stay there. In my case, 've encountered lots of drunks, obnoxious frat boys who were being racist toward foreign guest, noisy bachelorette party. The best were a couple who were fighting loudly in front the elevator on our floor and all over the hallway over the guy cheating on the girl numerous times. The girl was yelling and screaming expletives. Some guest did call the security to escort them back to their room. This is the scene out of Jerry Springer at its best.
All in all, it's a decent hotel with clean, quality room, and a good location if you don't pay too much for it.",3.0,3
"Old and musty room
Very old hotel. The hotel does not have an elevator so we had to heave 4 suitcases up the stairs. The room was very old, the floor was uneven and the carpet looked like a hundred years old. The hotel was very expensive ($230 per night) and in that price not even a complimentary breakfast was included.",2.0,2
"Location only with zero extras
The Milford Plaza is a historic hotel and has always been known for its great location; it is literally right next door to Shubert Alley and most of the Broadway theaters, and Times Square and Restaurant Row are a five-minute walk away. It is in a safe area right in the middle of everything with convenient subway access. Unfortunately, the property had become run down and is in the process of a much-needed facelift. As a result, room rates are a bargain compared to many area hotels, and I gave the property a try over a long weekend in mid-September. 
If you strictly want a prime location with no amenities, The Milford might be a good choice for you. I myself like and have come to rely on some of the basic amenities most hotels offer, and found the lack of extras at the Milford a hassle. Milford's management has eliminated extras that they feel guests don't necessarily want, for example, like coffeemakers in the rooms. They will tell you that there is a Starbuck's a block down the street and there is, but there was always at least a twenty-minute line there and you have to leave the room and the hotel and walk there to get it. Thus, I would recommend reading up on the property carefully and deciding what's important and cost-effective for you. Here are some pros, cons and warnings from my experience:
Pros
• My room was immaculately clean, and the maids whom I encountered were very helpful and friendly.
• Room size - some reviewers have complained about the small size, but I found them to be as big or bigger than many more expensive hotels in the area. It's NYC people, unless you have a suite at the Plaza, your room will be small. My room had a desk, which you don't always get. 
• Elevators are small in size but fast. At the Milford, you type in your room number and are prompted as to which elevator you get into, no waiting while it stops at every floor. Most of the time I went directly up or down to my room with no waits. 
• Blackout shades really do block out most of the light from the Times Square area up the street.
• Beds were super comfortable.
Cons
• Major noise and mess due to the renovation in the lobby. I was woken up by noise from the remodeling almost every day of my stay, and needless to say, the hotels' ambience was neither relaxing or visually appealing.
• Staff -The attitude of the reception and bell staff is resigned indifference. With just a few exceptions, I felt like I was treated as a hindrance, not a guest. One of the managers, Christine, was great when I had a problem with phone charges. She was pleasant, addressed my concern on the spot, and was an outstanding representative of this property. You'd expect that everyone directly working with guests would be like her, but that wasn't the case. I kept getting met with indifference and thought that the people were just having a bad day, then on other occasions I'd interact with the same staff and got the same attitude. I noticed that hardly any of the staff smiled, and during my whole stay, none of them initiated any contact with guests, like wishing somebody a good day. Most of the staff acted as if I annoyed them if I asked for anything.
• Door personnel were brusque and rude. I had arranged for a car to pick me up for a return trip to the airport. I was waiting outside and watching for the driver and had asked the doorman to please flag him down when he came so that I could get in right away. Instead, the driver was directed across the block by the doorman and I almost missed my flight. The driver told me that he and others who work for his company have had similar problems in the past with this hotel.
• The halls and rooms are supposed to be renovated, but lighting in the halls are dingy and the whole area is dark, except for full-color murals of NYC street scenes in various places. I understand they're going for an urban look, but I was on the tenth floor, and the mural by the elevators is of a storefront with stacks of old books and magazines by the curb in front of it. I can see the same sight by the dumpsters down the street, and I didn't find it particularly pleasant to look at every day. Even though the hall carpet is supposed to be new, there was numerous stains, including a huge splatter of something right in front of my room door. Rooms have exposed beams and felt like being in a dorm.
Check-in was a hassle. You have to drag your luggage up a flight of stairs as it is not on ground level. Once there, there are seven kiosks, but I never saw more than two of them staffed at a time, and I was there on a weekend. There was always a line, and nobody in it seemed very pleased. The downstairs area with luggage check-in was crowded and noisy all the time. It felt like standing around in a bus terminal or the DMV. I had a problem with my plastic key card and had to get it changed four times in three days. Each time was another 20-30 minute wait in the line at the desk.
• There are no refrigerators in the rooms. You can get one, but you must request it. 
• There are no coffeemakers in the rooms. I didn't see any available for guests in the lobby either. 
• There is no restaurant or bar for meeting people within the hotel.
• No free internet in the rooms. There is a kiosk with several printers in the noisy and crowded checkout area. You can print out boarding passes and flight itineraries for free, but you pay by the minute for additional web-surfing. There were usually people lined up to use them, so don't wait until the last minute if you need to print out flight information.
• Rooms have no luggage racks. This seems like a small detail but there are very few places to put your suitcases if you don't want to leave them right on the floor. 
• Beware phone charges. There is no charge for an incoming call, but you will be charged $1.25 for each outgoing call, even local ones. If you don't have a cell phone, this adds up very fast. 
During my stay, on a daily basis I heard people in the elevators, lobby or halls saying that they would never stay at this hotel again. To be fair, I can only speak from my own experiences. 
Overall, if you are a traveler who strictly uses your hotel room as a place to sleep and is only interested in a clean room in a safe and convenient location, the Milford could be for you. If you like the convenience of free internet in your room, a place to get a meal without leaving the property, and other amenities I mentioned, there are comparable hotels in the area where you can get them at about the same room rate as the Milford. I was bothered by the noise, the mess and chaos of the construction, and the attitude of the staff and will be choosing elsewhere the next time I'm in NYC.",2.0,2
"Strike 5, you're OUT!
Went for the weekend with another couple. Hubby & I went to check in at the front desk, the desk clerk said she ""couldn't help us"" then took the next person after us! I went back to her and said, ""I thought you couldn't help us?"" She said she needed someone else to help us???? Strike 1. Went to take the elevator to our rooms, 2 other people were there waiting. They got in, my girlfriend and I got in....that makes FOUR people! We let our Hubbies behind because the elevator couldn't hold more than 4 people and we only had 1 bag each! Strike 2. Got up to our ""upgraded"" room and only 1 of us could get in the bathroom at a time. It was THAT small! I had to squeeze myself in so I could close the door....I'm a size 8/10! Strike 3. When we checked out, I told the supervisor who was at the desk and he aplogized saying that we actually did get upgraded from a ""standard"" room. I really hate to see what a regular room looks like. I told him I've stayed in hotels worldwide and THAT was not an upgraded room. He tried to convince me it was (strike 4)......he obviously needs to do some traveling. They even put our $50, yes $50 one day valet parking fee on our friends' bill and said ""it was a mistake""....really! We didn't even check in together! That is a hefty ""mistake"" Won't be back!",1.0,1
"Very nice hotel; could be better
Stayed in th Warwick for 3 nights. Chose it bec. it was close to my work-related meeting location. Room was clean, large, and spacious, so I could spread out. Room had 3 phones, including one in the bathroom! Very friendly and helpful staff, and the hotel even has door staff that open the door for you as you enter or exit. Staff called me every morning on time for my wake-up call. Fast and free wireless in my room. Another guest told me he didn't have free wireless, so maybe I got lucky. My 7th floor room had a small balcony, which was cool, as I could see part of Denver. Shower was excellent, as was the water quality. Very elegant hotel interior.
Queen bed was too soft, so I sank into it (and I only weigh 140 pounds) and didn't sleep well any night. I need a firm bed to sleep on. Randolph's Restaurant in the hotel was a bit expensive, and I only found 1 meal I coud eat (a pasta dish) on the short dinner menu. Pasta was excellent, though. I ate at a nearby McDonald's one night just to save money and because I didn't want pasta again. (I had walked several blocks around the hotel, but all the eatery places loked like or were actual bars, were very crowded, and had lots of smokers congregated outside, so I didn't go in these places and went to McD's instead.) Business Center only had 2 computers for a large hotel, and the printer didn't work once, was out of paper another time, and was out of toner another time. Large flat screen TV was nice, but channel surfing was difficult bec. I wasn't familiar with the local channel and wanted to see the TV Channel Guide, so I had to click the remote several times to get to that Guide channel. Small outdoor pool on the top floor. I felt the water; it was somewhat heated, which seems a bit wasteful since it was mid-November.
Overall, it's a very nice hotel; I just wish I had a firmer bed.",4.0,4
"Great babymoon weekend
We were looking for a quick getaway from Dallas for the weekend, as my wife is due in about 2 months. This hotel met our needs as a place to relax and spend some time in a nice hotel within driving distance .
We booked through FHR (AMEX program), so we got an early check-in and got upgraded to a balcony room. It had a nice view of the city side, although I must say I am not very impressed with the SA skyline (is there one?). The only issue we had was they forgot about our perks for booking through AMEX and I had to stop at the front desk 3 times to make sure I got the ""envelope"" with our benefits. It seemed they were very overworked with all the people coming in over Memorial Day -- but they were friendly and helpful when I did talk to them.
Chairs were hard to come by the pool the weekend we went, but we got lucky and snagged some chairs in the morning both days in the adult only area. I did see a lot of people looking for chairs though and felt bad they did not have enough. However, less chairs meant the adult area was relatively quiet and away from the craziness of the kids' pools (which we never went). Servers came out every 15 minutes or so the check on any orders or anything we need.
The restaurants were excellent. Brannon's food was pretty good, but our server was excellent and made the meal better. Francesco's at Sunset was even better as they had a table with a perfect view of the sunset (fitting name). The food was prepared well and service was just as good. Expensive though, but I guess it's a hotel, right?
Pretty much the only resort ""activity"" we found is the pool area. I know there was a nature hiking trail, but we did not try that. Since our goal was to relax -- I would only come back here when there are less people (offseason) and if I was planning on golfing, which I heard is amazing from the people there.",4.0,4
"I would come back!
We only needed to stay one night and did not want to pay for an expensive hotel. I found it very cheap and I was very hesitant but I was extremely surprised when I arrived. 
The reception was really nice and the staff was very helpful. I was even more surprised when I got into the room. It was small, but perfect for two people, but very clean. There was also full cable, which is something that you don't even see at the Hilton, unless you pay for it. Everything exceeded our expectation especially for the price! 
I would recommend this hotel. The only downside: we did not have a car and there are not any restaurants that are nearby. They also do NOT have a shuttle so you need to find your own transportation to the airport. It was 20 bucks from there to the airport.",5.0,5
"Pack earplugs
Good points first: This hotel is close to the O'Hare airport (this will also be a bad point), the bed was comfortable and the sheets and towels were very soft. The fridge and microwave came in handy. The front desk staff was okay; all young and immature. Bad points: The entire hotel needs an upgrade, the curtains and furniture were filthy and the noise was intolerable. I went to Walgreens and prompty purchased high grade ear plugs to block the constant airplane noise as well as the noisy hallway and adjacent rooms. The hotel has poor insulation and you can hear people talking in other rooms but again earplugs was my answer. The pool was not filled. This is okay for an overnight jaunt, but unfortunately I stayed there a lot longer. You can catch the blue line ('L' ) catty-corner from the hotel. Then switch to the red line at Jackson to get into the city. I did this everyday and had no problem getting around. Buy a CTA pass for best value (hop on and off all busses and trains). There is a Dominicks grocery a short walk north of the hotel. A good Chicago eat fairly close to the Holiday Inn is Gino's East, but I like to go to Rogers Park for more diverse and authentic food. Find something unique off of Devon, Howard or Clark Street from Jamaican to Mediterranean food.",2.0,2
"Bad doesn't even describe it...
At first, room looked old with layers of paint on everything. After closer view, carpet was old, worn and dirty, bed had only 1 sheet over mattress (without a mattress pad), and 1 sheet to cover with. Dirty lamp and air conditioning unit in window. Bathroom had been redone recently, so it looked okay.
Next morning, went to take a shower - no hot water! Went to call down to desk - phone didn't work. Was plugged in, but dead. Took a VERY cold shower (after running water for over 15 minutes thinking it would get hot!), then went down to desk to check out.
Told guy behind desk about water. His response, ""You have to run the water for 15-20 minutes for the hot water to get up to the upper floors."" Told him I did, but also phone didn't work. He kept repeating himself. I told him I would take care of the issue myself with my credit card company. 
Don't stay here! Pay the extra money, and stay somewhere else - for your own good!",1.0,1
"Not up to Hilton standards...
Our stay was a total disaster from the moment we arrived. Check in was quick and efficient but as soon as we got to our room we couldn't get in. We were with a bellman as all luggage transports are locked up and chained and you must use a bellman to transport your baggage. I tried my key card five times and the door would not budge. Finally Mike tried and on his third try while using his shoulder the door finally opened. He told us that the doors sometimes stick and that it should work fine after, WRONG...our nightmare begins. After we put our luggage away, we were ready to explore the resort but had difficulty getting out of the room, the door would just not open. After several attempts we were out and I went to the front desk to explain our dilemma. We were assured the door would be repaired by the time we returned from the water park. We returned 3 hours later and the door was still inoperable. I called the front desk again and spoke to Tyler, I explained I was in Phoenix with my daughter and her three children. Her oldest child is being seen at Phoenix hospital on a monthly basis and this was supposed to be a mini vacation for her before her treatments. I flew in from Florida and my daughter drove from Las Cruces, New Mexico. He apologized profusely, asked if we were going to dinner and assured us that the door would be fixed by the time we got back. While getting dressed, Tyler sent up milk and cookies for the girls and gave us a certificate to use for dinner which was very thoughtful. We left for dinner, and when we returned a worker named Harry was finishing up the door and told us it was fixed, we turned in for the night. In the morning, we could not get out of the room again and had to call down to have someone open the door for us. I was very upset as this was a fire hazard and we could of been trapped in the room with no way out. This worker told us that the door could not be fixed and they would need to change our room, After changing our room, I requested that the previous night be comped as we did not have use of the room for most of the day and was told that I would be given 50% off. I felt this was not adequate and had the manager call me. He finally comped the room. I know this is a long review, but my frustation has not subsided.
We cut our stay 1 night. On the day of our departure we waited for over half an hour to have our luggage brought down. We finally lugged our bags ourselves. I am highly disappointed with the resort and would not recommend it to anyone. I expect more from Hilton. I am a gold member and have traveled all over the United States and always at a Hilton, this resort leaves a lot to be desired.",2.0,2
"Very disappointing
I had read all reviews from this hotel and was really disappointed. We had travelled across Arizona, Nevada and Califirnia and clearly you get less for your money in San Francisco. One of the reviews mentioned asking for a room with a view. I was allocated a room on the fourth floor and the receptionist found me another on the 12th floor. The view was overlooking Macy's but was really just a roof top and no view. It was continously noisy outside with construction work going on through the day & night. The rooms were very dated and small, as were the corridors. There was a step up to the bathroom and the toilet was right behind the door - only word I can use is pokey. There was no air conditioning (only ceiling fans), no coffee maker in the room and the bar closed at 9.30. On the plus side the location is excellent with the cable car passing the front door, shops on the door step and the AT&T (baseball) stadium is walkable. The hotel put on free coffee and cookies in the lobby which was nice. I am absolutely astounded that this hotel is so highly rated on trip adviser and really can't understand why.",2.0,2
"Decent space, hot jacuzzi and lots of complimentary food and drink = great weekend
4 of us stayed in a 1BR suite (2 queen beds in bedroom) and enjoyed our 2 weekend nights and had a great time. Lots of great points and just a few not-so-great ones.
Pluses: Location is @10 blks from White House and Mall (LIncoln/Vietnam Memorials)--good walking location, and just 4 blocks to metro. 1 BR suite was a bit snug but well appointed, with 2 large flat screens, 3 sinks and a decent-sized bathroom + separate bedroom. Even a window in the bedroom that opened--what a treat! Beds were wonderful and pillows were fluffy and comfortable. Room was a little stuffy so we set thermostat at 69 degrees and stayed comfortable.
Breakfast is bountiful and cocktail hour features wine and beer as well as a small selection of cocktails (including a 'cocktail of the day'). Munchies one night were fresh veggies and dip (yum) plus stack food (pretzels and goldfish). 3 colored tortilla chips, melted cheese/salsa/sour cream, and the requisite pretzels, were snacks on the 2nd night. 
The pool was warm and the jacuzzi was hot and perfect, and open until midnight--a delightful way to end a long day of touring.
Breakfast was decent, with a hot buffet, pastries (rather pedestrian but serviceable), cereals, juices and wonderfully hot and strong coffee. Service was excellent, from bellman to front desk folks to bartenders to pool staff (a woman who swept up the pool area around 10 pm was pleasant, friendly and swept at a brisk, competent pace). Staff seemed genuinely nice. 
At 6pm and at 9am hotel staff give out ""fish food"" to feed the giant koi. Grab a container and have fun feeding these giant goldfish!
Minuses: Parking garage was 'tight' --almost always full, with small, narrow spaces to park in-if you have a large car or SUV, beware. It's also expensive ($30 per day) but it's impossible to find street parking in the neighborhood, so if you drove there, you have no choice. 
The hotel was very busy, so kids running around and noise at breakfast and at cocktail hour was the norm, as were longish lines for cocktails (evening) or custom-made omelets (boring). 
Apples on the front desk were a great bonus, but one day they ran out and were not replenished :(, and the next day they were mushy/mealy. A nice touch, for sure...just not a very tasty one. 
All in all, this is a great place to stay for a couple of days and the free food and drink were a great bonus. Will stay there again!",4.0,4

"Renovations are underway...Ask Questions When Booking!
I had stayed here a year ago, and had a spectacular room. Renovations were underway this time, unknown to me, or to Hotwire, whom I had booked through. I was put in a different wing while the nicer wing I stayed in last year was being renovated. Nice and clean, but it was more like a cheaper motel than the La Quinta room I was in last year, which was like a nice hotel. 
Service was excellent, friendly staff, safe parking. Room was very small. Bathroom was micro. 
All and all, for La Quinta, it was sub-par. But compared to other rooms in the area at the same price, it was still a bargain. And free airport transfers. La Qiunta San Jose will be an outstanding property when finished....but ask questions BEFORE booking, as renovations can bring surprises!",4.0,4
"Simply Charming!
Room was pristine and comfortable. Loved the ""historic charm"" of the entire area. Service was perfect in every way. Any time of the year would be a good visit, lots to do in the square.

"good place, and it's new york
Depending what hotel are you looking for this one is perfect. If you only need a clean room, comfortable beds, and big enough bathroom that's your place. It's not fashion, it's not new, and it has average prize, it's New york you can't find anything cheap and good, it's impossible, believe me, I checked out. This one is a good option. 
The Starbucks in the side lobby is also a great convenience and you have couple of good places just around the corner or in front the hotel for breakfast. We stayed there 2 nights just down a 8h flight and I can say it was a perfect stay. It's not centric located and not very well comunicated by metro, but in 3 blocks you can reach times square so not bad at all if you want to avoid all the people of times square.",3.0,3
"Nice New Hyatt
Booked a three night stay at the Hyatt 48 Lex using points. The hotel so new that we had to tell the cab driver twice the name and location of it. The entrance and lobby definitely had a small boutique hotel feel, so no bellhop. The front desk staff was very friendly, given us the full list of amenities available. When I asked about whether wi-fi access would be complimentary(having just been given Hyatt platinum status the day prior). Unfortuntely, my status still showed as gold, but he offered to take care of it and that it would include access for two devices(for me and my wife). 
Elevator service is a bit slow given only being two elevators for 20+ floors. It often took a couple of swipes of the room keycard to allow us to select our floor in the elevator. Each level seemed to have only a handful of rooms due to the small footprint of the building. 
Our Lexington Studio appeared clean. The room was shaped like a narrow rectangle, making it feel small sometimes. Due to room layout, the placement of the two 40"" LCDs made for poor viewing angles. When in bed, the tv is at directly 90 degrees to the bed, mount on the wall just to the right of the bed(when laying down). Fortunately, the tv does swivel slightly, less than 10 degrees. 
The decor overall was not bad, with the exception of a low quality wood veneer tv/entertainment stand below the tv. There was a nice alarm clock/ipod speaker system on the nightstand that allow for convenient iphone charging. There were two nice reading lights next to the headboard on each side of the bed. There was a small fridge stocked with a few items but with enough room to store a few our of own drinks. There was also a microwave and surprisingly nice Fisher and Paykel small dishwasher. Not sure what anyone would be washing since they don't provide any dishware beyond a couple of glasses. The Nespresso coffee maker received high marks from my wife.
The bed was firm and comfortable. The bedding is my preferred style, generic white comfortable with plain sheets surrounding it(much preferrable to the quilted unchanged ones that you have to just throw on the floor as soon as you can).
The bathroom was above average in size and quality with a glass-enclosed shower. The toiletries were below average(or so my wife says). 
The location was good with a quick walk to the 4,5,6 Lexington subway stops and Grand Central stops for many other lines.
Overall, a very good stay for New York City. Would stay here again",4.0,4
"Perfect location.. Shame about the club noise!
My wife and I stayed at The Standard in July for 4 nights.... we picked this hotel as the location is perfect and it looks pretty cool! The service was excellent and very professional - a young, cool vibe is pervasive throughout the hotel. Room was very small, but that's cool as we spent most of our time exploring the city... The one downside is the internal noise... we stayed on the 15th floor and were woken up at ~3am on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday with loud bass coming from a club in the hotel.... super annoying!! I had read other reviews referencing this as a complaint and it is annoying....
So, in closing... great location, professional staff... downside; the noise from the club - and it is loud!",3.0,3

And now for something different than your last hotel experience. The Indigo is bright and playful and spunky. Why not? You will like the free parking and short walk to the Galleria.

This hotel stinks. Musty, dank, stuffy, stinky smell - ick. Definitely not the three star accommodations that Priceline protrayed it to be. And they have used high gloss paint throughout the hotel - very tacky and outdated looking. The hotel obviously gets heavy use - it is in need of paint touch up and cleaning - all areas - lobby, halls, elevators, rooms, bathrooms. The one redeeming quality - the bed and linens were great. Staff were very nice - but I would never stay here again. ick!",2.0,2
"Yikes!
My boyfriend and I went to Phoenix on a quick business/vacation trip. We have stayed at Days Inns (other locations) before they have been pretty nice for motels. We booked the motel for 4 days and that was a mistake. 
First, thing we noticed was the horrible location. It is surrounded by strip clubs (the really gross kind), trashy motels, and a prison about a block away. People staying there seemed to be nice and mistaken travelers like us, but it appeared more like the place you would take a prostitute (no joking). 
The staff was friendly, but kind of short with guest. 
The lobby/check-in building looked nice, new furniture, and a small business center, with an ancient computer. We didn't even brother with the crappy free breakfast.
The room looked clean at first, but on closer inspection was really gross. The bed did seem to have fresh sheets, but there were a few stains and lots of wholes. The pillows were gross and flat, meaning they have not been replaced in a long time.
 The furniture looked nice but was really cheap, I sat my small travel bag on the table and it wobbled and almost broke. 
The bathroom was the worst. The tub was gross and stained. They tried to cover it with a white rubber mat but you could still see it. The tub had hairs in it (EWWW!!). They window was gross and cover in dead flies. And they didn't even bother putting a new roll of toilet paper in. 
We ended up staying one night because we had to. The next day I found family members to stay with for the rest of the trip. The hotel would not refund our money. What a waste. I wish I had read more reviews before booking.",2.0,2
"Room = 10, Amenities = 5, Food = 3, Staff = 2
One of the best hotel rooms we have ever had, with a terrific soaker tub and huge, seperate shower. Robes & slippers a nice touch. This is the only compliment we can provide. Casino had all the usual games, but operated on tokens, the cost of which was not to be found, so it was dificult to determine minimum bet. Tobacco reek very significant, causing my eyes to burn. Non-smoking room nicely segregrated to avoid smell, but very small, leaving you feeling like you are in the gmes room at a cineplex theatre. High rollers room depressing with two unsavory-looking people coming out of it. Overall I was left with the impression many people were here to see if they could win their rent for the month. Those who did win had a single store to spend their loot in, and nothing else close by. Food was largely fast food or diner, with a single buffet and one high end place. I thought they were underserviced and the food we had wasn't particularly good quality. Nothing else to walk to either. A rather isolated location. Staff security was exceptionally poor. We were supposed to show our room keys to get to our room, but the guard was absent several times and the limit of 4 per room did not stop the people next door from having a party of 20 with music that could be heard throughout the floor. Their party started at 8:00 and we tried to be tolerant but we could no longer hear our tv by 10:30 so called to complain and nothing was done. We called again at 11:05 since the noise curfew would have kicked in and a secuirty guard did arrive then. He did a good job emptying the room. We heard him notify security that no further visitors should be permitted for the night, yet visitors made their way to that room 3 more times during the evening. On another note, the guest ahead of us in the long check-in line was told that she would have to pay an extra $125/night for EACH of her two very small dogs. Really? $250 for two tiny dogs that may not do any damage. Ok, I get not allowing dogs, charging a small extra fee for additional vacuuming of dog hair, or charging a large deposit to be applied if there is damage, but $250 even if no damage is done?? Yikes.",2.0,2
"The review I told them I didn't want to write.
Mixed review on this place. The price is better than most, and the location is nice if you're looking to be near Time Square and close to a subway entrance. But as you'll see below, management is not responsive to their customers. I emailed IHG and told them of my bad experience and how I heard nothing back from management. I told them I'd love to give them a chance to respond so I didn't have to post this review. They put me in touch with someone who, guess what, didn't respond to my call!
My review is more with the customer service. They put on a big show at the front and I thought I was going to get what I have come to expect from the InterContinental Hotels and the reason I have chosen as of this year to direct all my loyalty from another award program to IHG.
So at the airport I realized I made the dreaded mistake of leaving my phone charger plugged into the wall of my room. I emailed the hotel about my charger, providing my name, room number, and Priority Club Rewards seeing if there would be any way to send it to me (noting I would be happy to pay shipping charges). I quickly got a response that seemed promising asking for a bit more detail. I provided the woman the information and heard nothing. Emailed a week later for follow up, and still nothing. Called and got the run around. And now a month later, am not only without my charger, but without a return email to say yes we will return it or no we won't. 
Here is the most telling part of their customer service: I even went to IHG corporate and emailed them saying I had a frustrating experience, and would love to give them a chance to address it before I posted this review. They put me in touch with a manager who emailed me saying he would like to speak and when I called and missed him, he never returned the call. How many times do you give a hotel a chance to excel in customer service? In my case, it seemed like one too many.
It's really a shame. Again, location is fine enough but the customer service leads me to believe this hotel has a lot to work on. I expected more from an InterContinental brand and hope this is not a sign of things to come for my upcoming travel season.",2.0,2
"This hotel is within the red light district!
Pros- helpful reception staff,welcoming, lauderette is close by. Free WIFI (if you can get it working).
Cons- this hotel is situated at the top of a long lonely road, right next to the freeway in the red light district of Memphis. There is an abundance of truckers and curb crawlers in this area.
It is surrounded by a lot of waste land and poor quality motels, strip bars and clubs. The local shop doesnt have much in the choice of food to buy. 
The breakfast in this hotel is diabolical, if you have a gluten intolerance or similar you are basically screwed.
Taxi firms, yellow cabs or otherwis will rip you off if you are not a local.
The house keeping staff are nice enough and helpful until you ask for something then they suck their teeth at you and huff and puff.
i ordered a take away and ended up with cockroaches in my room and had to throw it away!
The coffee is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and they dont have tea.

This has to be on purpose. I'm sure they don't want you watching movies on the Internet instead of buying theirs, but I purposely booked this hotel because we had no power in our home and I desperately needed in connection to upload files and a little AC.

This is a HORRIBLE place to stay...

Even the corporate franchise owner(Accor North America) refuses to be manageable when dealing through the Better Business Bureau..
Even if I'd gotten the discounted rate, this place was horrible.. My room didn't lock (Rm #246), so I had to pack up & move my things to my truck while gone... The heater/AC unit blew out a foul odor on either setting... There were shady characters hanging around the back side maybe selling drugs & with overly dressed up women walking the parking lot..

"A true find in Times Square....
I generally enjoy staying at a boutique hotel when I'm traveling outside of the country or to a beach. When I'm in New York City, I tend to stick with chain hotels as there are certain comforts that I rely on at the end of a busy day and boutique hotels do not always offer these comforts.
I was so surprised to find a unique, comfortable and affordable hotel that also offered creature comforts that are usually only found in larger, more traditional hotels! Check-in at The Night Hotel was professional and quick. There was an interesting ambience in the lobby with quiet activity and hospitality. I was offered assistance to get my bags to my room and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean, fresh and welcoming the decor appeared. 
The room design is striking (the headboard of the bed is quite a design statement), the linens and bed is very comfortable and the bathroom offers all the amenities (shampoo, conditioner, soaps, hair dryer, sewing kit). There was a closet with a safe, an umbrella and full length bathrobes. In addition, the room offered a small refrigerator and everything needed to open a bottle of wine or mix a cocktail (no plastic glasses).
Though I rarely watch television, the wall mounted television was high definition, there were movies and plenty of channels, I could borrow movies and games from the lobby (if I desired) or chose a movie to be billed to my room. There was a desk, plenty of outlets and plenty of comfortable pillows. And did I mention the Bose Wave sound system? It was so nice to come back to the room at the end of the day to quietly playing classical music, low lighting and the bathrobe waiting on the bed.
Every employee - and I mean everyone - was professional, attentive and helpful. I felt completely safe and though I stayed on the second floor, I had no issues with noise. In fact, I fell into bed each night and felt completely ""cocooned""...some of the best night's of sleep I have had in a hotel.
The Night is mere steps from Times Square and smack in the middle of the theater district - a welcome proximity as as woman walking back to the hotel alone after a broadway show. There were restaurants and activities of every price point nearby and yet, when you walked into the hotel, there was a pervasive sense of calm that told you that you ""were home""....at least for a little while.
The Night hotel is in a great destination spot, but the hotel itself is worthy of a visit just to enjoy being pampered a bit. The combination is unbeatable. My son goes to college in New York City and I visit frequently. From now on, The Night will be the only place that I will stay.",5.0,5
"Good value for money but rooms could use some updating
I stayed at the Melrose Hotel Washington DC for a week long conference.
On the plus side, the hotel is well located near a number of good and very good restaurants. The neighbourhood appears to be safe and fairly quiet. It is one mile from the Lincoln Memorial and the rest of the Mall, a few blocks from the trendy and fashionable shops in Georgetown, and a short walk to the Foggy Bottom metro station. The lobby, bar and lounge area is attractive with a clean, open and contemporary look. The room rates for the conference were a bargain. Everyone we encountered from the doorman to the house keeping staff was very pleasant and helpful. The concierge was very accommodating in moving me from a room with two doubles to a room with a king bed. The latter room was particularly spacious.
On the negative side, the two different standard rooms I stayed in were both a bit tired looking. The carpet was getting a dingy colour and the bathrooms are very small. One of the bath tubs had a coating which was peeling, the other had a stopper which did not work. The décor of the rooms were a bit old fashioned. 
Other details: the rooms have a coffee maker and an empty mini refrigerator. Glasses in the room are plastic but I got wine glasses from the bar in the lobby and the housekeeping staff re-supplied me with clean wine glasses each day. The rooms were quiet for sleeping, the beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning (which was essential for the heat wave while I was there) worked well. 
We only tried the hotel’s continental breakfast which was fine. The fitness center was cramped but offered a good range of equipment. There is no pool.
The hotel normally charges for wifi internet access, although it was included with the conference rate rooms, and the internet speed was good, which sometimes is not the case with hotels with free internet.
If I were picking my own hotel, I might choose to pay more for a more upscale and contemporary looking place, but based on the conference rate I received, this hotel was excellent value for money.",3.0,3
"Convenient but overwhelmed
I had the unfortunate opportunity to stay at the grand hyatt dfw not by choice but by American Airlines cancellation. When the flight was cancelled, we had to stay one more night in Dallas. We chose to stay at the airport grounds due to convenience. The hotel is located in terminal D and is easily accessible by airport tram. 
It turns out we weren't the only people staying due to cancellation. The check in staff reported she was out of king size beds but when we told her we had gold status, she quickly found a room with a king bed. Ironic, isn't it? 
we were hungry and tried out the restaurant and were told there would be an hour wait. It was Easter Sunday and American must have cancelled half of it's flights. The restaurant was poorly understaffed. We sat at the bar and due to our exhaustion, we ordered to go. The bartender was very busy and impatient. I realized why...she was the only person tending to all the customers at the bar, the snack area and the orders that the wait staff was putting in for drinks for the restaurant. Yes, she was the ONLY person. She ran around, flying from one end of the bar to the other, and back again and slamming glasses and wine bottles around. Soon we noticed she was so backed up, the wait staff started pouring their own wine. And not to mention the piles of dirty wine glasses, carafes, plates, sitting on top of the counter. We sat for an hour waiting for our food to go. We were lucky. Apparently people sitting down dining had a 2 hour wait. Maybe it was just a bad day/night. We ran into another couple on the elevator who bought food from the snack bar. They couldn't even get a plastic spoon. That's how bad it was. 
We proceeded to our room. It was right across the elevators. So you can hear everything. The room was very modernized, with a huge window that spanned the entire wall. Everything is electronic, and with a touch of a button, you can control the blinds, the lights , etc. The shower was quite small, the size of one I would expect in city living, such as DC. THere was a tub, opposite of stand up shower, that we didn't use. The bed was firm, too firm. When we woke up at 5 am the next morning, i hit the button ""soft light"", but it wasn't soft, it turned on all the lights and blinded me, instead. The worse part was hearing people talking and walking throughout the night. The rooms were fine, just request away from elevator. 
We would do it for convenience for traveling, but otherwise I would highly recommend the new omni convention center hotel if staying in Dallas.",3.0,3
"Not a 4 star Hotel!!!
We bid on a four star hotel in Hotwire for 620 euros (for 4 nights) and Hotel Felix was what came up in the computer screen. This hotel is far from 4 stars and we certainly feel we were misled by Hotwire. I think that Hotwire needs to revaluate about it. The room was tiny (we could not even find the space in order to open our suitcases) and we were told from the reception that they had complimented us by giving us a suite (although it was situated in the 11th floor, it was far from a suite and if this is the case, then I am really wondering how the normal rooms look like!). Imagine that there was not even a closet in the room. On the positive side, the room was very clean and quiet. The staff at the reception was helpful and polite. The location is good but not excellent. If your trip to Chicago is for shopping then yes, the location is indeed good (it is 5-6 blocks from Michigan Avenue and close to nice restaurants) but if you want to explore the city and do some serious sightseeing, then the location is definitely not the right one. Hotel Felix could be an 3 star hotel, but it certainly does not come close to a 4 star hotel.",2.0,2

"Still A Good Hotel...Expected Better
In town for a wedding and brought a guest to show off my fabulous city and stay at what I thought was the finest hotel in Indianapolis. From my previous experience at the Conrad two years ago, I just knew it was the perfect choice to make a first impression on my friend. After my stay this past weekend, I am not so sure the Conrad is living up to my expectations of a 4/5 star hotel.
Long story short, my stay was a Friday/Saturday night stay and for the time my guest and I stayed in the hotel room, things were fine short of the minor thumping we heard from the housekeeping crew at various hours.
My complaints were few, but critical considering the property being one of the elite in the city.
#1. Valet service was HORRIBLE. This is not an exaggeration but truth. I was shocked to learn that the Friday night we checked in valet was not accepting call downs for vehicles. We had been told by front desk to call down if we needed to have the car brought up. When I dialed down, the service desk told me they were not accepting calls and we had to come downstairs to have our car pulled. I was a little embarrassed. I had boasted about the Conrad all the way to Indianapolis and I was quite surprised to start the night out with an inconvenience that should not have happened in a hotel of this caliber. Nonetheless, we went downstairs to have the car pulled and it took about 20 minutes. This is quite a high turnaround in my opinion, but considering it was 5pm on a Friday, I let it go and chalked it up to rush hour. Unfortunately, this ended up being the norm for the rest of the weekend. Of the 3 additional times I had my vehicle pulled only the last time was it under 25 minutes, and the last time was check-out. There was an obvious lack of staff and coordination out front. The fact that I'm paying an additional $33 per night for parking made this issue #1 on my list. If you are going to charge for a service, set the expectation with the customer and if you cannot live up to it because of limited staffing or other reasons, compensate your guests. I did make a complaint to the front desk and was told they were totally booked and were just really busy. Though there were a few events going on downtown, I don't believe that is an excuse when you are charging a premium price for a product and service. Not to mention Indianapolis is a Super Bowl city.
#2 Telephone. This is a small issue, but I had to note it because once again this is a high-caliber hotel. There were 3 phones in the room. One on the desk, one in the bathroom and one next to the bed. The cordless next to the bed did not function. We had to order room service from the phone by the desk, which isn't a big deal, but again one of those little things that a 4/5 star hotel wouldn't miss. The room attendant that brought the food up laughed and just ignored it like it would go away on its own. I would expect a paid employee for the hotel to at least notify someone to have the phone replaced right away. The guests should not have to deal with such matters. Trivial, but important to me when I am paying top $$$ to stay at the finest in the city. Room 1517 just in case any of the hotel staff happens to read this.
#3 Customer service. My last stay here I felt extremely welcome and special. This time, not so much. It was as if the A team packed up and left after the Super Bowl. On this stay the hotel was staffed by a team that was not as engaged as I would expect which led to just an average experience for me and my guest. I am very disappointed that my guest did not experience the hotel the way that I did for the first time. 
I've always said its the little things that help me make decisions in life. These three small things have added up to a possible stay at the JW next time I am in Indy.",3.0,3

"Fab location!!!!!!!!
Our first trip to New York and we couldn't have stayed in a better located hotel for the price we paid!!!! 
45 min drive from the airport!!! If you aren't travelling in rush hour can be tubed at a third of the price!!! 
Excellent service as soon as we got there... We were told our room was quite small so the receptionist checked us into a bigger room with a view of the river! Nice modern room with everything you need for a base to explore, bathroom could be modernised but more than fine for the short time we were there! 
Located right opposite Madison square gardens ( you can't hear the concerts which depending could be a bad or good thing! ) Macy's is 5 minute walk and Empire State Building is 15 min walk! 
I would definitely recommend a metro card for a week at 29dollars! Even if you are only there for a few days works out cost effective to hop on and off!!! 
There's a bar and a diner located within the hotel which is fine for a quick drink/sandwich but everything you need is right outside the doors!!! 
Shopping tips!! Make sure room in your case!!! Century 21 department store great for bargains!! £350 handbags in the uk for £120 here!!!! Also when we were there Macy's had 25% off and as a visitor you could get another 5% off!!!
On leaving if you are taking a taxi get the doormen to get you a town car as cheaper than if the concierge in the hotel gets you one!! 
We will definitely be staying at the New Yorker again when we return next year!!!",4.0,4

Disgusting! Not worth the money. Was only there for one night and woke up the next day with my inner arm and part of my face and neck covered in bed bug bites!

If they run out of parking spots, you have to go find parking somewhere else, and in Hollywood that's no easy task. Will never return.

We were at a buisness conference in Fort Worth, Texas and we had a room at the Shearton near the convention center. Very convienent to the Convention Center, within walking distance.

"Great location, unfortunately the accomodations are terrible
I was very surprised to find how outdated and uncomfortable this hotel is. I am a traveling consultant, and I originally booked it as it is very convenient to my client. While the front desk staff was very friendly, the rest of the stay quickly went downhill. 
The room I was given was not what I had booked. In addition, the beds were very uncomfortable, likely needing to be replaced back when it was still a Crowne Plaza. There were no quilts or comforters on either of the queen beds. The TV was ancient, and the hallway light made an incessant whirring noise. As for the gym, if the machines worked, they didn't feel safe (specifically talking about the eliptical machines). Also the food from room service was not good nor worth the price.

"Rude Staff, Noisy & Lack Luster
Although a frequent business traveler to Chicago, this was the first time I stayed at the Westin on Michigan Avenue. Unfortunately, my first introduction to this hotel was riddled with problems, which mainly point to issues with rude staff and poor housekeeping. This will be my last visit to this below-par property. 
My stay started out on the wrong foot: upon check-in, I discovered the bathroom wasn’t clean; suffice to say that toilet was visibly used & unflushed. The front desk manager quickly offered me an alternate room on the same floor. This time, however, there was a dog barking at the top of his lungs next door; the bellman (who provided me the room keys) also heard the noise and agreed that this would not be an acceptable room either. The third assigned room appeared to be clean and noise-free … until early the next morning. At 8AM (Saturday), I was jolted out of a sound sleep by all sorts of racket arising from slamming doors (made by guests and housekeepers). The physical make-up of the hotel rooms seems not to muffle outside, hallway noise … regardless of the room, I think I probably would have experienced the same annoying hallway noise, so no sense in trying to change rooms (again) … I resorted to earplugs. 
The physical hotel itself isn’t anything to write home about. Although I was staying on one of the “preferred” floors, it wasn’t obvious to me that there was anything special about the hallways or rooms. Perhaps the bathrobe? The room looked worn: the furnishings looked beat-up; the bathroom ceiling has chipped paint from what looked like a previous flood; the vanity in the bathroom needed to be repainted or replaced. The only good thing was the bed, which was comfortable & firm. 
On the second day there, I was temporarily leaving my room (to grab a Starbucks from the lobby and return to my room) when a rude housekeeper barked at me and asked when I was leaving my room (I had a “do not disturb” sign on the door); I said I would be vacating the room around 2pm and would call housekeeping to let them know when I needed service. In a confrontational manner, she said, “Well, I have another floor to clean and will not be back here at 2!” I indicated once again that I would call the housekeeping department when I was leaving the hotel (which I did at approximately 2pm). Housekeeping said that they would send someone up to clean the room. By the way, the maid's chart was parked in front of a room across the hallway as I left for the day (the “do not disturb” sign was removed as I left the room). When I returned to the hotel at 1:30AM, the room hadn’t been serviced. I called to the front desk and complained. They sent up clean towels and replenished the coffee supplies for the coffeemaker. The evening front desk manager also gave me a voucher for $35 to be used for room service to compensate me for the inconvenience. I appreciated his gesture at trying to remediate the situation. 
The final blow was at checkout : the front desk clerk was unbelievably rude and nasty especially when she was asked to research why the voucher for $35 for a room service comp didn’t appear on my bill (I had handy the receipt from room service which showed the credit). I seriously thought she was going to bite my head off. She wanted me to step aside and let her check other guests in first before she dealt with clearly up my bill issue. Even though I was rushing to meet a departing flight, I brought this incident to the attention on the manager on duty, who told me he would address the situation. 
I really can’t remember the last time I had such bad service in a hotel – especially in Chicago wherein guest service is very good. Something is seriously wrong with either recruitment of good personnel and / or proper guest service training. Further, the hotel could benefit from some rehab and TLC. Nothing special here. My recommendation would be to avoid and use other hotels in the area. 
Follow-up to my visit & for the record: the front desk manager sent me an email to apologize for my issue at check-out and added a poultry allotment “Starpoints” to my Starwood Preferred account. While a nice gesture (better than nothing I suppose), the points really didn’t add up to much and hardly worth the effort or fanfare. Also for the record, I didn’t ask for any compensation, refunds, or discounts for any of my problems.",2.0,2
"I would stay away from this place...
If I could give this place a negative rating I certainly would. I have stayed at this place for two weeks; my first week wasn’t that bad. It is true that the minute you walk in the room smells musty (but this is the case with most hotels in the Baymedows area, I am not sure why) the rooms were okay not clean as you could see spider webs on the ceiling. For a lack of better choice I decided to stay with them again for a second time, bad choice. I found a roach in roaming thru my bag the morning after I checked in. I called and requested them to change my room and move my stuff. That was nice that they did that for me, however when they moved my stuff they moved the roach with it. Instead of taking care of the problem by getting the room inspected for further bugs or getting rid of the bug problems they have the problem follow me. I called the front office that night informing of the inconvenience, her response (I think her name was Alisha) was more like “Ok and you want me to do what with it?” there was no apology for it no compassion, no emotions whatsoever in regards to my two nights of wasted sleep. At this point I asked specifically to be contacted by the Manager to talk about this. The next day I walk in, I had no call from the manager neither was my room serviced. The roach I had killed myself (so proud of me and feel so brave) was still at the same place I had left it. After calling the front again (this time the person was sorry and helpful) and expressing my unhappiness over the issue the manager called me not once but twice and sent room service right away; however it was too late by then the damage was done. The impression of this property will never recover in my eyes. One of the worst places I have stayed in so far. To her credit she did offer me 2000 (an average Hilton points for a night stay is 40,000 points FYI) Hilton points and a day of comp stay for my inconvenience but I decided not to take it. I would stay away from this place and someone from the Hilton offices need to give this place a look or shut it down for taking up useless space.",1.0,1

"This was the worst hotel I have ever ever stayed in
I should have read the reviews already here before I booked this place...
I was traveling alone on my way to a new job and just wanted a place that was cheap, with free internet. I didn't realize until I got here that the hotel is in kind of a seedy area. There are no real restaurants around, only fast food places to go to for dinner. I checked in fairly early and was planning to use the internet but couldn't keep a signal on my computer. I called the front desk about it but the situation didn't improve. 
The room seemed okay but the keyless entry didn't work easily and, as it was explained to me, you had to jimmy the handle to get it to lock correctly on exiting the room. 
I found things on the floor like bobby pins and wrapped soap from the previous stay that gave the impression that the place hadn't really been vacuumed or otherwise cleaned. 
As I was starting to settle down to go to sleep ~12am, a MOUSE ran across the floor and disappeared. I moved to a new room down the hall (where the internet actually works), but only at my request and I have not been offered any sort of a refund or discount on my stay. This place is horrible. I travel a lot but this is probably the worst hotel I have ever ever stayed in.",1.0,1
"Decent enough for the $$$
We stayed here for a few nights last weekend, booked on expedia's ""surprise me"" plan so we were committed. 
The room was fairly musty and probably was a smoking room in the past. Internet was and up-charge, and I gave up on ever getting a coffee in lobby in the mornings as the singly staffed coffee bar was always backed up.
The two good things I can say about the place is at least the bed was comfortable and the airplane noise was surprisingly quiet for being so close to the airport.
Oh yeah, one other good thing... It's right by the Cedarbrook Lodge (where we wanted to stay) which has a fantastic restaurant, the Copperleaf. One of the BEST meals we've had in a while.",3.0,3
"Excellent !
Recently, I had the pleasure of providing on-site implementation support for a company who was in Charlotte for a meeting at this Hilton. While the hotel and its location are excellent, they are exceeded only by the service of Erin Brown and staff. Accommodating and responsive are two words that come immediately to mind when describing these individuals. Our meeting had constantly moving parts and requests, but all were met with a profound willingness to help. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a location for your next meeting or event.",5.0,5
"Room size great, but everything else poor
Our family of 5 visited during spring break for 5 days. Each meal the service was horrific especially during breakfast. The buffet was in constant need of replenishment and you had to beg for coffee. Tried to order off the menu, but food came wrong and slow. To use the water park you had to wait in a 30+ minute line so you could scramble for a lounge chair. Instead tried to use the pool by the room and they had only 13 lounge chairs. The housekeepers were pleasant, but room each day was not cleaned until after 3:00PM. One day the water was turned off for the afternoon and still off when we left for dinner at 7:00 meaning no toilet flushing, no shower after a hot day in the sun and on the same day they lost electricity and could not supply towels at the water park. The positive's: room size was great and weather was awesome. We would not go back and would highly recommend looking for an alternate property to visit.",2.0,2
"Never again
Would never stay here again, ended up checking out early. First off there is no air conditioning, I realise a lot of SF doesn't have A/C but I've never heard of a hotel not having it! The room was very stuffy so we had to open the window in order to get any type of breeze or fresh air, well the noise from the road right outside was so bad that having a window open meant no sleep for us. The internet was horrible, we could barely get it to work and the times it actually did (about 3 minutes at a time), the connection was slower than dial up. The pillows were all feather pillows which meant no support for our necks, and the bedding was an old Kimpton hotel duvet!? The walls are very thin and we could hear the neighbour's TV all night, the bathroom light won't stay on for longer than I think 5-7 minutes so when I was in the shower all of a sudden the bathroom light went out and it was pitch black (right as I was shaving my legs!)... The check in time for this hotel isn't until 4pm which is a bit inconvenient, I arrived at 2:30 and they would not let me check in early. The elevator is the slowest elevator I have ever experienced. All in all this hotel is a disaster, beware before you book it, it may seem like a good deal but if you're used to decent hotels you will be disappointed at this one.",1.0,1

"NOT a good experience
After reading the last review, we booked this hotel with great anticipation for our stay in Austin. However; this hotel was extremely disappointing and gross. Arriving onto to our room on the second floor, we were overwhelmed with the scent of marijuana, and cigarette smoke (although it was a non-smoking floor). The overall appearence was dark, dingy and uninviting; not at all family friendly. The hotel was very loud, and we were woken at several times during the night by loud noises and unruly client behaviour. The pool was closed for chemical treatment on the weekend which was a disappointment. Although the room was of average cleanliness, the tub was leaking and the toilet was malfunctioning. Breakfast in the morning consisted of frozen bread and other unappetizing choices. Support staff, such as the woman managing the breakfast and the room staff, appeared to be in their pajamas and were completely unprofessional looking. We make frequent trips to Austin, and this hotel will be forever off our list.",1.0,1

I stayed at The Monarch for 5 days during the Google I/O week and I wasnt exactly happy. I am used to budget hotels but this one is on the worse side.

Yup, people are smoking weed over and over for years at The Monarch and the stale smell lasts. 
The rooms were not cleaned properly - there was an empty bottle behind the desk at my room (312) and the closet was full of labels and bags from Ross... It was what made me want to leave... I just could not on my tight budget :)
Otherwise it was ok. No bedbugs, enough warm water in the evening and morning, the coffee was passable (and actually nice to have), the vending machine was out of order but ice machine worked.

"Mike Campbell-Front Desk is Wonderful!
When we were checking in, Mike Campbell asked what brought us to Chicago. When I told him that we were in town for a funeral, he offered his condolences.

"ok for one night if you need the airport shuttle
the worst thing about this motel is the total lack of concern for customer care. when i called the front desk because the tv was not working, they answered after 10 minutes and said they'd call the satelite provider and then they hung up. they never came to the room or called back. i later saw that the cable behind the tv was disconnected so i connected it myself.
when i used the computer in the lobby, i witnessed the phone ringing for 15 minutes with no one answering it. the woman had left to take her kids to school and the husband was sleeping. he later came into the lobby barefoot and half awake.
the room was large, clean and comfortable with a king bed and tv with about 15 channels. no fridge or microwave or iron .
but the room smelled like urine even though it looked clean. ther was no lamp by the table for reading. the bathroom sink faucet handle fell off when i touched it.
the breakfast was actually good- coffee, tea, juices, oatmeal packets, cold cereal, white toast and pastry.
the airport shuttle van was reliable and fast.
overall, since i had a discount rate, it was an ok deal for the price. but the customer service attitude of the owners is appaling and i probably would not stay there again.",2.0,2
"Cockroach in my room
I thought I would just try this place, to try someplace cheap and save myself some money. Big mistake. The room was tiny, which I expected. But the one thing I cannot abide is a lack of cleanliness. I dropped off my stuff and went out. I came back very late only to find a large cockroach on the wall to greet me. Cockroaches can carry diseases like dysentery and typhoid. So I called the front desk to have someone come up and kill the disgusting thing. The guy who came up was more scared of the bug than I was. I end up stomping it with my foot because it finally ran to the floor. When I checked out the next day (because I couldn't check out in the middle of the night) they offered me $25 off a $179 bill. Big deal. I thought at least they could have split the bill, half to me, half to the cockroach. He spent more time in there than I did. I have traveled all over the world and the only other time I had cockroaches in my room was in a dumpy hotel in Oaxaca, Mexico when I was 24.

Such a shame.. we have stayed twice in this small hotel with its perfect midtown location and friendly and helpful concierge.

She hands you a slip of paper with your room number on it and tells you that you should sign the slip when you have finished breakfast and leave it on the table. On this bit of paper is a box where you may fill in a gratuity.. I chose not to as I prefer to give cash rather than charge tips to my room. When we went to check out we realised that they had fraudulently added a tip to that slip of paper each morning. The front desk wouldnt do anything about it as they said that we had signed the slip of paper and couldnt prove that the gratuity had been added afterwards. We were disgusted and would not stay there any more. Sad as we had recommended this hotel to many friends... Now I would advise people to stay away based on the dishonesty we experienced.",2.0,2
"Horrible Hotel, Worst Ever stay at Congress Plaza Hotel in chicago, il
Horrible Hotel, Worst Ever stay at Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago, IL
Well to start off I would like to say that I have stayed in hundreds of hotels in which many of the stays were in Chicago, IL, and The Congress Plaza Hotel was the nastiest and most horrible of them all. I booked this hotel thinking since I was paying almost $300 a night it was going to be a very nice luxury stay, and it was completely the opposite. Below describes my hotel stay…
1.) I arrived at the hotel hoping like any other stay at any other hotel if they have rooms available they will allow you to check in early. This hotel however was much different, the front desk staff, “Margarita” was very rude and acted like it was a complete imposition for us to even be at the hotel early than expected, so since we had a large amount of luggage our only option was to sit the lobby for 3 hours watching them laugh at us.
2.) When I booked the hotel package, it described the room in which it stated internet was included. When I arrived at the hotel they told me it was not included, it was an extra charge of $9.95 a day. 
3.) Finally when it was time to get to the room, we arrived in a room that had a small odor not a huge deal we opened the windows to let the odor out. The walls were very dirty and dingy. The wallpaper is peeling and very badly stained with a yellow tint, even though this was a non-smoking room. The carpets were stained and very old and dirty looking, this was among the worst looking hotel room I have ever stayed in. Don’t wear white socks in your room; your socks will have a black bottom in no time.
4.) After we unloaded all of our luggage, I needed to get connected to the internet and I learned that it was not even WI-FI internet, it was a wired connection that has about a foot cord slack attached to the wall next to a desk. So my laptop could not even be where I wanted it in my room it had to be attached in the corner desk in the living room area. The technician had to come up to the room a total of 4 different times during my stay to fix my room’s internet modem to make my internet work. I moved rooms 3 times because of other issues and still had the same problems.
5.) Tv was not clear on all channels; the tv is fuzzy and lines running through the screen in all rooms we stayed in, which were 1201, 1101, 1168, and 700.
6.) Room temperature is controlled by the hotel; the rooms only have an attached fan in the window that you can circulate outside air in the room. The room was very cold at times.
7.) To top it off the electric went off a total of 7 times in our room in which the second time the front desk guy told me that if I have too much plugged in at one time it will go off, I told him that the only thing that was turned on was one lamp, the tv, and my laptop was plugged in. He told me that I must have had other things plugged in as well because it wouldn’t have just turned off for those items, so anyways the electric went off 7 times during my stay once while I was in the shower really convenient, and the others while I was watching tv or on the laptop. 
8.) Also there is only one entrance to the hotel and when we arrived we found about 20-30 protesters holding signs saying “Unite Here” and “Im on strike” I later learned that these people have been doing this every day for the last 10 years, So this hotel has a bad reputation among a very large crowd of people.
8.) I changed rooms a total of three times, and as a result of all my problems for a $1200 hotel stay, The hotel general manger “ Shakeel Sibbiqui” gave me a free hotel dinner valued at $40.00 for free. When I asked for compensation on my stay, he insisted that they gave me enough.
9.) I did not see directly, but I saw other reviews from a few people that had pictures of cockroaches in the rooms, If I had known this before my stay I wouldn’t have booked it.

Free wifi in the lobby. Modern bathroom. The best part: Wolfgang Puck single serve coffee machine complete with take out cups and lids in the room (my pet peeve is a hotel without in-room coffee, forcing you to order it from room service which is a pain if you have a really early morning before room service opens up). Great location, a tad bit away from the frenzy of midtown, but still close enough so that you can be there in a jiffy for meetings or shopping. Comfy bed.

I will be staying again.",3.0,3
"Never stayed in a worse hotel
I don't know what else to say other than this hotel is just horrible. The lobby looks nice, so you do get the impression that it might be a good place to stay. But when we got to our room that impression changed entirely. The only reason we even stayed the night is because the room was paid for by someone else because we were in town on a business trip. Next time I will be sure to insist on someplace else.
Whether it was little things like the safety latch on the door being broken, or really nasty things like all of the chairs having 'mystery stains' on them, this room was just unacceptable. One of the towels we had in our bathroom was stained, as were the walls, the floor, the chairs, and the nightstand. The bathtub had a huge gap on the front between the wall and the tub, and the calking around the tub was peeling off all around the tub. The ceiling looks like it had repair work done from leaking pipes, but they never really re-finished the ceiling or put the trim back up. The window sill was dirty and had lots of stains on it, and the curtains wouldn't close completely.
On the positive side, at least we didn't see any bugs like some of the other reviews stated. Maybe that's one problem they have solved.
One thing is for sure, I won't be back and I recommend you don't go.",1.0,1

The rooms were old, outdated and filthy. Water damaged walls, no iron or hanging rod in the closet. There was a strong, unpleasant odor in the room.

I have no idea why the online ratings for this property are universally on the positive side. The rooms are dark, dirty, and noisy.

My best guess is that the hotel gives out these free amenities to draw people they otherwise cannot due to their dismal facility. The hotel was marketed as a boutique property, but believe me it was anything but. I have never checked out of a hotel immediately upon seeing the rooms, but I did so here. Simply not worth the money. I would have been much better off at a Hampton Inn-style property.",1.0,1

"Great location and hotel but service needs some work
I have been a gold member for Starwood hotels for two years now and I love their hotels but occasionally there is a slip in their service. I booked the Westin Chicago River North on half points and half money for 2 nights. My wife and I flew different times so she had to check in first. I made sure her name was on the reservation. The problem came when the person at the front desk said that she did not qualify for complimentary internet because she was a ""regular member"" not gold. She kindly asked to look me up and that I was a gold member. He still said no! When I found out about this, I was a bit upset because whoever checked her in is a moron! I don't call people that very often but he was. She insisted that he look closely but he kept saying no. But when I called, they said I was a gold member and wouldn't be any problem. 
Another problem came when we asked for late check out at 4 pm (another perk of being a gold member). They said no problem but then when it came to check out they asked us when we were checking out? We told them 4 pm because that's one of the perks. They said again that I wasn't a gold member! I was mad at that point because either these people were knew or just not very smart! I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt again so after I hung, I called the front desk again and asked for late check out and they said not a problem. I told them someone just called and said I couldn't. They apologized and said it was fine. 
Other than some of the front desk people not knowing what they are doing, our stay was fine. I think the hotel should really train their staff better in looking up information. I would stay here again but if I experience this problem again I will make a formal complaint.
As for the room, it was a great room with a semi view of the river! It was easily accessible to transportation and overall a great hotel and located in prime area! Definitely recommend staying here!",3.0,3

River side location for the Hyatt means it is well located for restaurants nearby and has a walking path that seems well used.

"Average Stay
Based on the other reviews and photos, I had high expectations for the Palomar and booked it for our group flying in from Toronto for a meeting. I was a little surprised by how small and dark the hotel was. My room was tiny and very cramped, the King bed barely fit in the space, and it was awkward manoeuvring around the bed to get to the closet, etc. (and I'm a small person). However, some of my colleagues reported having spacious rooms, so perhaps it was just my room. I went to make coffee and realized there was not a coffee maker in the room, which seemed odd as every hotel I've ever stayed in always provided one. I called down to see if there was anywhere I could buy coffee in the hotel, and they said they'd send a coffee maker up (which they did so about 15 minutes later) so problem was solved...but it seemed odd that they wouldn't just have one already in the room? You shouldn't have to ask. I liked the idea of the animal print robes, but when I looked at the ones provided they were really faded and worn looking...and that sort of brought forth the rather unappealing thought of how many others had worn that robe before me...but that's just me. Other than that, our experience was okay. The staff were polite and helpful. The hotel bar was also small and kind of cramped, but a happening place...so that made it good.",3.0,3

We have just returned from this hotel and can only think of positive things to say which is reflected in the vast majority of comments from other reviewers. We booked a one bedroom suite which was perfect for our family with access to a balcony and a fabulous view of the Empire State Building. The room was also exceptionally quiet which is in contrast to many hotels I have stayed in. The pillow menu was also a welcome touch
We dined in Rare on our first evening after a long trip from the Uk and it was very good. Good atmosphere too

We Have family living in Chicago and have visited over 10 hotels in downtown. This was by far the worst. Have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels for $250. The city was very booked so we got screwed $300 plus dollars for the worst corner room in the place which I might add was booked on trip advisor. Saw other rooms and this was the smallest and smelled like smoke even though it was non smoking. The room was clean. Extremely noisy on the street. They claim to have good sleep amenities in their brochure. They include lumpy pillows, average bed and ear plugs to drown out the noise. The front desk is totally worthless. Not courteous, texting and when we asked for a concierge for dinner, they didn't know what that was. Fitness center was okay but very dirty. The diner and bar next door was welcoming with a pleasant staff. If we would of paid less then $200 we would not complain. But to charge what they did it is a rip.",1.0,1
"very dirty and noisy !!!!!
First night was TERRIBLE ! Tiny room, NO space for a crib and really really noisy . The worst however IS THAT IT IS SO DIRTY !!!! Changed to a room on the 11th floor to an even smaller room just because they said it would be quieter . Well, this room is so small there is no space for our 3 pieces of luggage , the baby crib cannot fit so baby has to sleep in bed wi th us , the noise is exactly the same and there seems to be something wrong with the heat. It is 2 degrees outside but i have the windows open to even he temperature. They said they did not know but when we got in thare already was a fan from the previous guests ... So.... Of course the knew there was a problem . WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY....",1.0,1
"Best Luxury Hotel - for you and your pet.
Had a great weekend at the Alexis-Seattle. Guest services = A++++. Front desk agent greeted and acknowledged us upon arrival (remembered that we've stayed there a week ago). Great location, right on First Avenue. We are a Kimpton Intouch Member and were upgraded to a wonderful Executive Suite. There are two other hotel (Vintage Park/Monaco) in the Kimpton Family in Seattle, this one so far is our favorite for the amazing art displays by local artists. Room was spotless, nice decor, luxury bath products. If you are traveling with a Pet, you pet will LOVE the extra luxury pet-bed....and the tasty treats in the lobby. 
PS. The hotel gone to great efforts to welcome you and your pet (with his/her name) on a board in the lobby - Woof!",5.0,5
"Hilton on the Highway.
This was a perfectly acceptable Hilton. It is probably quite lovely at the holidays and truth be told the 1980's music always on in the lobby made me laugh. The restaurant was fine for a soup and salad and the breakfast buffet was fine. 
The beds were comfortable and my room was clean. Spotless? No. But clean. Everything worked (coffee pot, iron, hair dryer).
My only complaint, and given this is in Southern California- there are very few places to go that are walking distance- like the sushi place next door. Otherwise, if you don't have a car, you're stuck. Luckily I have friends who live not too far away and they came in and we went to an historic district maybe 15 minutes away- up a bunch of hills is all I remember. Fun little places to eat, drink and shop.",3.0,3
"Theft from our locked room
Was there with most of my family for a wedding.On the day of the wedding, we went down for breakfast to meet everyone, so I only brought my phone and since my purse wouldn't fit in the safe, left on the side of the bed, with the do not disturb sign on the door. When we came back upstairs to shower and change a couple hours later, the purse was gone. In it was makeup, some jewelry, and ipods, etc. Was I an idiot to leave it in the room? Yes, obviously. But I really didn't think that I was at risk for a couple of hours. Anyway, we filed a police report after no one at the hotel did anything about it. But they took my information so they could make a claim with their insurance. For what? So then they tried to add a bar tab on our bill which was insult to injury since we weren't even at the bar. No we are out over $1000.00.",1.0,1
"Clean, updated, good location
I usually get a 3-4* hotel at Hotwire or Priceline but none were in my price range for this midweek stay. Took a chance on Comfort Inn based on positive reviews.
The hotel was in a decent location in Theatre District, next door to Birdland club. 
Room was small but adequate. Everything was clean and up-to-date. My biggest complaint is rather small: no place to hold soap/shampoo in the small shower. That made my morning shower a bit of a juggling act. Strange that they don't add a shelf or holder for make it user-friendly.
Free breakfast had many choices including made-to-order waffle. 
This hotel is a fine alternative when the 3 and 4 star options are too expensive.",4.0,4

"Less than expected.
We have stayed at many Hilton properties, and almost always had an exceptional experience. However, this stay was well below our expectations.
First, there was a disgusting stain on the cushions of the couch. It smelled. Bad.
Next, when we went to the pool, there were no clean towels.
Then, the television remote did not work.
Finally, we sprung for ""breakfast in bed"" in the morning, and we were very disappointed. We ordered pancakes, and there was no butter or syrup on the tray. We clearly stated there were 2 people sharing the order (and we ordered 2 entrees), but there was only one set of silverware. 
It may seem like these were small things, but it seemed to us that nothing worked well for us. It was one complication after another, and that's not what we've come to expect from Hilton.",2.0,2

From not being greeted properly, (Welcome! Thank you for being a Priority Club Member! Here is your complimentary water and snack. How may I help you? Real hard, right?),or having my special request honored at the front desk, to some of the worst customer service at the lounge and restaurant, I have ever experienced. At my evening meal, I had to continually interrupt the waitress from her texting, to get silverware, condiments, napkins, and cocktails, and yes, even get my bill. The breakfast experience was even worse. Filthy table and glasses, had to ask for creamers, silverware, and clean my table. I observed 7 tables that were served foor and had to wait and ask for silverware. I would not stay here again!!",2.0,2

Arrived late in the evening June 1st, tired after traveling and a family Graduation. Greeted with an offer to provide food for us if needed. More than helpful, the Night clerk could not have been more welcoming. 
The room was a good size, typical Hyatt Place style, easily accomodated my husband, myself and adult son.
Clean and welcoming.
Next morning we had a good Breakfast before hitting the road once again. It is meant to be a Continental Breakfast but they also offered scrambled egg and plenty of selection.
The Customer Service was what made this Hotel stand out, it was a nice surprise.
I would definitely stay here again if traveling through the Columbus area.",4.0,4
"My BEST HOTEL STAY E-V-E-R! DO NOT MISS OUT ON IT!
We were fortunate enough to be referred to this location by a family friend for this past weekend. When we arrived we were checked in by Victor who provided GREAT customer service from start to finish. He provided the fastest, most accurate, and complete service I have ever had in hotel check-in and otherwise. I cannot begin to explain how much having a person like him being the first face a customer sees is worth...PRICELESS! Thanks a million Victor! I stayed in room 1306 (a 2br suite) which was very clean. Nothing was out of place or missing from the suite. Again, the best accomadations ever. My sister stayed in room 1310 which was immaculate as well. KUDOS goes to Housekeeping! I cannot forget Levi! He was very helpful and friendly on the next morning. He and Victor great customers with a smile and wonderful service. Levi prepared our waffles and suggested setting arrangements which made the process tremendously easy. I had to get their names because I never forget people like them who provide such wonderful service in a business where they encounter many different attitudes. I watched these guys assist many people with a smile. The other staff keep the breakfast buffet stocked and tables cleaned (with Victor and Levi assisting as well). Last but not least, I called on the evening before my stay and a young lady (I did not get her name) attempted to help me book the second room. I decided to let my sister call back to book the room but the young lady was very eager to assist and did later help my sister. I will stay here evertime I visit Charlotte and have already recommended this location to several friends all thanks to your SPECTACULAR STAFF! Y'ALL ROCK!",5.0,5
"Not a Three Star Hotel Even at a Discount Price
Booked this hotel through a discount price website which was advertised as a three-star hotel. It is not, in fact, it should be condemned. There was so much mold growing on the shower tile that I would not let my three year old grandson take a bath in the tub. The drapes were stained and had holes in them. I am sure the bathroom floor had not been mopped in months. While using the washer in the hotel, a couple came in wanting to wash all of their clothes because they had found bed bugs in their room. (We looked and did not find any in our room.) Three of the pools in the water park were out of order during our stay, including the kiddie pool which meant that my grandson had no place to swim. When we asked about a refund or reduction in the admission price, we were told no. Take my advice, do not book in this hotel!!",1.0,1
"Great hotel if you like action movies
The minute I walked in the door at this hotel I knew I was in for a journey. I entered in through the bar so I could check into the hotel as the lobby was being ""remodeled"". I walked down several corridors before I came to a cheap fold-able table with a couple of PCs set up for check-in service. As I was trying to check in I could not hear a word the personnel were saying over ""Texas chainsaw massacre"" going on in the room behind us. Nonetheless this is all about a temporary situation due to the remodel. What really drove down the rating of this hotel was the fact that I could not get any sleep as all I could hear were police sirens and horns blazing all night long (I was on the eighteenth floor). How is this even possible that they cannot mute out the sounds from the street on the 18th floor? Maybe they are piping it in so it will drown out the sounds of the drunk guy in the room next to me that maybe had to many Patron shots with his chicken wings? I don't know but it was not a very restful stay for me at all!",2.0,2
"A two-star hotel masquerading as a four-star hotel
I have stayed in about 20 different hotels in downtown Chicago, and this one ranks near the bottom. The rooms had a cheap quality to them with dingy carpet and furniture, reminiscent of a cheap Holiday Inn. The sink basin was extremely shallow and splashed water everywhere, and the desk was too small even to fit my laptop computer! Everything was very crowded and small.",2.0,2
"Not in the best area of town
This hotel seems like a 'boutique' hotel. The rooms are small and the decor was funky - in our room in particular, we had one hot pink wall and a light fixture made of silver spray-painted zip ties. I like the funky decor but overall, the place didn't seem as clean or new as the other boutique type hotel we stayed at the night before, which was called The Mosser. The thing I did like about this hotel was that the elevator was one of those old style elevators with the gate that you have to pull closed, but be warned the elevator can maybe fit two people and their luggage at best!
Warning - This hotel is not in the greatest part of town. During the day, there are some people walking around but the area does have more homeless and shady looking people then the more central downtown core of San Francisco. So much so that we didn't really want to be walking around at night in that area, so we conveniently hopped on a bus almost directly across the street from our hotel which ran every 4 minutes or so and was only $2.00 each to get to the better part of the city to have dinner. 
Parking was hard to find even though our GPS kept telling us there was parking nearby, we drove around and around trying to find it and ended up parking at the civic centre underground parking lot which was quite a few blocks away.
The staff person was friendly, but overall I found it a little pricey for what you get (we paid about 140 plus tax).",3.0,3
"Do Not Stay Here
I have stayed at the Hotel five times but will not visit it again. My chicken Caesar salad at lunch was inedible and the food which was edible was substandard and very expensive.

The rooms have broken furniture half the lights dont work. To make things worse the front Desk clerk drives his car and parks outside my room and is nosing around I dont know what he was doing and I was worried he would try and do something to my car ( it is a very bad neighborhood ) so I could not sleep all night. I would not advise anybody to ever stay here.",1.0,1

"New York Palace is a great location
where we have stayed many times over the years. We can easily walk to the theatre district, shopping, museums and restaurants. The hotel's public space is gorgeous and I used to think the rooms were awesome but on this last visit, they seem to be showing some wear and tear and don't seem quite as pristine and glamorous.
The staff is extremely polite and accommodating and the house keepers do a GREAT job.
We found the $15.99 per day charge for wireless internet to be a bit over the top in this day and age of most hotels offering free wifi. 
We never have had breakfast at the hotel as the prices are off the charts but there is a wonderful Pain Quotidien a few blocks away that serves a great breakfast.
My husband would love to see an in room coffee maker and was pretty upset we had to go out of the room for that first cup of coffee or pay a huge price for in room delivery.
We did take advantage of the complimentary shoe shine service and enjoyed free NY Times delivered to our room.
All in all it was an enjoyable stay although there was loud banging noise outside our room that seemed to be something to do with the heating system and it kept me up a couple of times in the middle of the night. Of course, this is NYC so you expect to hear sirens and other city noise but overall we slept well and the bed was very comfortable.

"Perfect only if you are on government business and must be close to the White House
This is definitely a good property, but I don't think it is a good tourist property. If you are on vacation, I recommend you stay a little out of the center of town, and rely on the Metro (subway) to get around. You will save a lot of money. The rooms are clean, service is friendly, and the staff is efficient. The rooms are a bit small however. The most offensive component was parking. We were traveling on three motorcycles, and they asked us to put all three in one space but wanted to charge as if we were in three spaces. Although it is ""valet only) we had to park the bikes ourselves, and the ramp was so steep that it was terrifying.",3.0,3
"Dead Crickets in an odd hotel
We arrived and found some dead crickets in our room. The hotel was happy to change our rooms which was really nice, but they sent up a maintenance man who told us that we probably brought the crickets in on our luggage and blamed us for it. They were nice enough to give us $10/person to use on food in the hotel, and we appreciated that gesture. The rooms there are odd. The walls are really thin so we could hear the people outside on the street and also the people talking in the room next door. The light you turn on for the sink turns on the light in the rest of the room so if you don't want to wake up anyone else sleeping while you're in the bathroom, good luck! Also, there's frosted glass between the shower/toilet and the bedroom. so if you're there with someone in a non-romantic way, be careful because you can see a bit too much of that person!",2.0,2

"Boston's best
I couldn't believe a property that didn't charge an arm and a leg would be this fantastic but it is all that and more. The location is elegant. Stroll down Commonwealth for an early walk and soak it all in. Check in is a breeze, with attentive and friendly front desk personnel providing outstanding customer service. 
Our room was a small suite with tasteful furnishings and a great view. Super comfortable bed with nice linens. The bathroom was clean and functional. One sink but who really cares? Keep in mind $300 per night. 
The gym is small and barely adequate. No showers. A few nice treadmills and bikes and dumbbells. Breakfast and lunch are first class. 
When I called to make a reservation Corinne, Director of Revenue, assisted. She steered us to the Island Creek Oyster Bar for dinner and suggested the hotel's bar Hawthorne for a drink. She is a brilliant woman. Both the bar and the restaurant are beyond description. Don't miss either. The hotel, along with the two aforementioned attached establishments, provided an unparalled experience we will never forget.",5.0,5
"Not safe!!!
My sixteen year old daughter and I was there for three days for a conference. During the visit, my daughter had felt bullied by housekeeping on the second day, and was highly upset by housekeeping the second day. The first time, my daughter (who was alone in the room both times) was getting ready when housekeeping came in, even though my daughter kept trying to inform her that she was getting ready. The housekeeper came in anyway and stood there while my daughter repeated numerous times that she was getting ready before the housekeeper would leave. The second instance was the next day. The housekeeper came in early in the morning. My daughter heard the door open and again, had to repeat numerous times to the housekeep that she was still asleep. The housekeeper finally left the room, BUT SHE LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN!! Are you kidding me!!! This created a totally unsafe environment for my daughter. Anyone could of walked into the room!!! I am so upset that my daughter was put into this position. I called immediately on the drive home and left a message with the manager. It has been four days, and NO ONE has bothered to call me back even though my message stated that I needed to talk about a situation that happened with my 16 year old daughter during our stay. Never would I stay here again, especially if I have my children with me.",1.0,1

Without doubt this hotel is the worst I have every used. Spent two days in June in the hotel, and that was two days too long.
The BATHROOM was dirty - cracked and missing tiles; the BEDROOM had no air-con (just a small ceiling fan) and electric cables and TV leads trailed over dirty worn carpets.. The bed came with a USED (not clean) blanket, sheet and a couple of pillows.
There was a kettle on the floor with two tea bags, and one coffee bag. No sugar or spoons supplied. When questioned - the front desk staff told me they did not provide coffee / tea making facilities in bedrooms!

"Fair for one night, not much to expect.
We stayed at the La Quinta Inn & Suites LAX for one night in april 2012 at the end of our trip in the West, just before an early morning flight. We booked a room with two queen beds for two adults and one kid. 
Our room was pleasant : bright and quite new with a 70s feeling but with not much amenities (flat screen TV and free Wi-Fi but no fridge or microwave). The bathroom was clean and in good condition. 
We didn’t test the breakfast as we left the hotel at 5.00 am nor the outdoor pool.
This La Quinta is located near the airport, just a short drive to the rental car returns. There is a brand new McDonald’s, very clean, next door.
We have mixed feelings about our stay : the room was ok but we had minor disappointments : we were surprised to have to pay the parking for the night (15$) as we got no information about it when we booked the room, plus, there are only two elevators and very slow ones, it’s not great for an airport hotel…
In short, an ordinary stay. Rather 3.5/5.",3.0,3

Then we checked in the guest service staff were extremely slow and not overly friendly, then we asked about WiFi at she informed us it was not free. Me and my husband travel and stay in hotels frequently and i think that it is bad show these days for a hotel chain as big as the Hilton to not offer free WiFi or internet. On our trip we stayed in 2 other hotels....a best western and a Hyatt and both hotels offered free WiFi and the best western was free parking.

Location is great but the hotel is an absolute waste. I am sure there are other hotels nearby, not on Orchid Ave, that will be more 'stay-able'. May cost a bit more but it will be worth it.

I've stayed here before and wrote a glowing review then - my 2nd review confirms that one. From the moment we arrived (9 am on day of check in, and they let us check in - to an upgraded suite no less!), we were treated like royalty. This is a smaller boutique hotel, and clients receive personalized service. There are little things in the room like complimentary filtered water, turndown service with a goody at night, complimentary wifi.

We were advised not to go out walking after dark. The streets smell of marijuana from the homeless people. The lifts are slow. The rooms all need sound proofing from the other rooms, the constant ping of the lift and the ice machine!. The rooms and walkaways were tired.

I just came back from a weekend here. The location is great, and the rooms on the bayside are really relaxing as they look into the harbor and the hills of San Diego. It's a great spot to have a mini-getaway, good paths for running, biking and it's close to all types of boating. 
Pros: location, pool, hot tub, Try the caprise omlet for breakfast! Wi-Fi is free. 
Cons: rooms are outdated, and the linens were a bit stale/ mildew ridden. The service was understaffed, as was noted several times during our stay by staffmembers. The towel service for the beach and pool is in the lobby, not by the pool. Parking is $15 per night and they tell you there are no other options. (But- you can actually park for free on the street- just be sure to read the signs.) There is an extensive health club but you have to pay $15 to use it.",3.0,3
"DO NOT STAY AT THE GRAND HYATT NEW YORK!!!
My wife and I are fairly well travelled and have just spent the last month travelling through Canda and US. We are currently staying at the Grand Hyatt New York and I can tell you it is by far the worst of all 15 hotels we have stayed. Some problems we have encounted,
1. Water pressure, there isn't any! And the hot water takes 5 minutes to get warm.
2. Cleaners don't clean and barely make the bed.
3. Room phone does not work at all!
4. The plug in the wash basin does not open or close. We had to hold it open with a bobb pin.
We booked three months ago so we could have a good experience in New York and we have been placed in a substantial room which is poorly designed. Eg: to watch a movie, (more on that below), only one person can relax on lounge, the other has to lie on the bed (room 1731)
After three days of our room not being cleaned properly (basic things like, replacing the soap and shampoo/conditioner, wiping down coffee table and cleaning sink as it won't drain properly which leaves soap and shaving scum), I approached the desk and nicely requested that the room be cleaned to a higher standard. I was basically flogged off and told they would fix? Didn't happen! Next day (today 12/6/12) I was looking for a bottle opener as we wanted to share a bottle of wine and watch a movie and I could not locate one? I then picked up the phone to request and the phone doesn't work? I then went down stairs to reception and spoke to one of the managers who told me they don't supply bottle openers however she would lend me one at NO CHARGE... As if she was doing me a favour (evidently there is a service charge to use a bottle opener). I thanked her and also told her about the phone, sink, water pressure, and the state of the room and was basically dismissed. After comming back to my room I opened a bottle of wine and sat back to watch a movie and you guessed it, it doesn't work!!! We are now waiting the the service man to come up to the room to have a look (after my wife went back downstairs to tell reception - due to the phone not working).
Service terrible, hotel terrible. It's a shame as it is in a great location (next door to grand central station)
I stay at many hotels through out AUS/NZ AND STH EAST ASIA and will certainly Not be recommending the Hyatt chain to colleagues and clients.

"we´d like to come back
We´ve been to San Francisco many times, and never stayed in this hotel; but we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is located in a building which is more than 100 years old. Therefore, the rooms are quite small and so are the bathrooms. The location is great, on Powell, almost on Union Square. Our room was in the back on the fifth floor and even with our window a few inches open at night, we never heard any noise from the city! When we arrived in the middle of the day, we heard some terrible hammering and drilling, so we were very afraid about that, (construction work in the former Borders building I guess) but luckily we were never disturbed by that in the early mornings, and we stayed for 6 nights. I loved the bed, very comfortable. There´s also a pillow menu, if you like. The room and bathroom were both very clean. There´s a walk in closet to store your luggage. The only thing missing in the room was a fridge. The free wifi in the room was excellent, we even used it to make skype calls. I liked the little candy jar and the nice rubber duckie; a nice touch. Staff was very friendly. In the lobby is free coffee and tea (and cookies!) available the whole day, we enjoyed that too.

As a Hilton Honors member, this has got to be the least friendly Hilton Hotel in existence. Checking in was OK (nothing special), checking out was a nightmare. Paid for their Park and Fly package. On exit, we were 20 minutes late for our 7 days parking package. The clerk tried to charge us for a whole days of parking instead of an additional 30 minutes. Being at midnight, there was no one else I could talk to according to this clerk. His response was if you don't pay, you don't get out. Finally had to ""educate"" the guy that its 20 minutes late and not 24 and 1/2 hours late. He finally recognized his mistake but was too arrogant to even offer an apology. I would have been satisfied with an apology. Ended up paying for an hour of parking (spent a total of another 20 minutes arguing with him) so he made me pay for the entire hour instead of 30 minutes. Could you believe such attitude.",1.0,1
"Great location!
Just returned from my first trip ever to NYC. It was a 3 night business trip. I booked the Roosevelt because of its close proximity to the office and reasonable price. You could feel the history when walking into the lobby, it was quite charming. And the energy is contagious.
Check in was a breeze. Within a short amount of time, I was settling into my cozy queen room. I did the typical first glance – appeared to be clean, flat panel TV, lots of pillows. That worked for me. The room is small, as is the bathroom. If my husband joined me, it might have felt very crowded, but I was alone so it suited me just fine. I would agree in that “renovated” might used a bit loosely, but I was happy with the room. My only slight complaint about the room was the lack of a workspace since I was there on business, but given I typically work from the couch or bed at home, it definitely was not big deal. And a simple pleasant surprise, the toiletries were Bath & Body Works, which I would use at home.
I did not eat at the hotel, so cannot speak to the restaurants; however I did check out the lobby bar and the rooftop lounge. Both we’re fine. I expected a beer to be outrageously priced, but they weren’t in either place. I found that the lobby bar was more accommodating for a party of one, but the rooftop lounge is definitely worth checking out.
The best part of the Roosevelt is the location. Although I was in town for work, it was my first trip to NYC so I put on my tourist hat in the evenings. I could walk to everything – Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, the Empire State Building, 5th Ave shopping – everything was so close. Even when dark, it didn’t bother me one bit being out and about on my own.
I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",4.0,4
"Neglected Gem
We stayed at the St Anthony in 1998, it was exquisite hotel back then. This week we had hoped to repeat our experience, but were sadly disappointed. Will start with the good things about the hotel before describing the disappointments. The services are very good offering valet parking, and bell hops. The hotel is historic and was beautifully decorated. The bed was very comfortable for my wife(she gave it 5 stars), but too soft for my liking (i give it 2). The location is 2 blocks off of the river-walk, not at all inconvenient. The pool area is clean and open from 6 am - midnight, and there is a fitness room, open 24 hours. 
 The problems with the hotel are telling of very poor management. We witnessed the valet group were playing a constant game of adolescent goofing, it wasn't until our departure that we witnessed a single valet professional. Who manages this group? They are the front line of customer service and they acted like immature high school boys goofing around. We had to request bellhop service at the valet, and had to wait for them, in 1998 we were greeted by a bellhop upon arrival. The lobby area was showing signs of use worn furnishings and elevators were in a poor aesthetic state. In the room: The carpet was worn, furniture was torn, water stained lampshades, furniture seriously dinged and damaged, drawers did not close, cabinet doors wouldn't close, cheap plastic toilet seat that slides around, some lights were burned out, and some power outlets weren't working. The furnishings were merely a shadow of their former grandeur, it was very sad to see this wonderful hotel being so neglected. Compared to other comparable hotels they fell short of some basic services, like complimentary in room internet. They charge 9.95 per day, an absurdity in this day in age when even McDonald's or a motel 6 offers free in room wifi... Also, the maid service rang our bell repeatedly at 8:50 am (check out time is noon). I have only seen maids do this in understaffed hotels where they have a lot of rooms to clean ,another sign of poor management. Although this was once a true luxury hotel, it is no longer, you could have a better hotel experience at a local super 8 for a 1/4 the price and receive a complimentary breakfast as well. Shame on the owners and management of this building.",2.0,2
"I love this hotel
If you are throwing an event this is where it needs to be! My husband and I had our wedding with approximately 120 guest in attendance at this hotel on August 10, 2012 and we have had the best wedding and planning experience. We worked with Carleen Stockburger, the Senior Sales Manager, and she was the best, throughout this year of planning. Carleen worked along side our wedding planner to ensure that it was beyond what we dreamed of, and even threw in several beautiful surprises on our wedding day. Carleen is very professional, personable, and did her best to ensure that this process was as stress free as possible. 
I have lived in Austin for 9 years, and never would've imagined this hotel is as beautiful as it is. Driving by on IH-35 or the service road gives it no justice at all. In the middle of the building they have a beautiful courtyard with lots of archways that remind me of something you would see on a building in Greece. The interior is very clean and has a Spanish colonial style. We had a lot of guest from NY, NJ, FL, and IL and a great portion of them rant and raved on the beauty of the hotel and complimented the great hospitality that they received from the moment they checked in until the time they checked out. 
I can not say Thank-You enough to Carleen, and all of her wonderful staff for making sure our day was as beautiful as can be, being flexible, and being very responsive to all requests.
Thanks to The DoubleTree our family has titled our wedding, as the best wedding in our family thus far!!!

"Good hotel
This appears to be a well-maintained hotel. There is enough space in the room to move self as well as baggage. My room had a coffee maker, TV, Table, Chairs, laundry facility, hair dryer, WiFi access but no Microwave Oven. Internet access is also available near the lobby 24 hours free of charge.

"Don't believe the reviews
We picked this hotel for a one night stay before flying out early Monday morning. It was near the airport and the car rental return and had good reviews, but I think the other people must have stayed at another hotel. The place was old, worn out and dismal. Our window looked out into an alley and the bathroom was filled with cracked tiles, moldy corners, and looked dirty. The carpet was old and worn. The heater produced damp, clammy air. The deck clerk was rude when we checked in - I stood beside the only person checking in and the clerk snapped at me to ""get in line"" like there were dozens of people waiting. I would strongly suggest that you spend a few dollars more and go somewhere that was more welcoming. It was not a deal for what we paid, even in San Diego.",2.0,2
"Great service and location
I would highly recommend Hotel Max. I got a deal booking on a a service I found via Hipmunk, and thought it was a great value for the money.
The hotel restaurant was a highlight: excellent food, beer and wine, and good prices at happy hour. The hotel is close to everything downtown and convenient to public transportation. The staff were professional, friendly and helpful at all times.
One complaint I could imagine some people having was that the rooms, particularly the bathrooms, are small. If you are a large person you might want to check that they can give you a room with a bigger shower, because even for an average sized person like me it was a bit tight. I knew this before booking so I wasn't surprised and had no problem with it.",4.0,4
"Needs Upgrades
Good location. Nice people at front desk but Days Inn management needs to spend a little money and put some up grades in the place. It has the feel the hotels in the 60's. Not much in the area of restaurants so you better eat before you get there. And forget about shopping only a nursery close by.
I booked through Wyndham and got a smoking room. I do not smoke and my daughter has asthma. Unfortunately Wyndham puts you in whatever room is available. The location is way out so do not expect much in restaurants around there.",2.0,2
"Stay Away
On our 2nd trip to Austin, we wanted to stay in a nice place. Willing to spend at least $300/night the hotel website looked promising? Upon arrival, several service errors and failures occurred to which we wanted out of this place! The initial front desk clerk swiped our credit card to the wrong room to which we got a bill a month later even though we left the hotels with the mgr giving us a ckout recipt with a zero bal. They gave us a downgrade room then confirmed saying it was an upgrade to which the front door lock was not secure. Confirmed by security to which he called maintenance. 20min later still not fixed. Asked for mgr who was suppose to come to the room but never came. We called and asked for a manager to which he never came. Upon reaching a mgr, asked for compensation for the time or a room change. He then gave us the original room which he said was an upgrade. At that point, we said that was suppose to be our original room to which the FD agent said the current room was an upgrade(a lie). When we finally got into the suite, it was a small and dark suite. No views, except for the brick wall and pipes. We asked for another room to which no empathy was given. Hotel was sold-out and this was the only room. This hotel is the worst experience we have ever had. We had better service and lower brand/star hotels. We've stayed at Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, DaysInn, Kimpton, Four Seasons and others. I am sure that this hotel has some very nice rooms, but there customer service skills and humanity is none. A month later we receive a bill, they had swiped our credit card on the wrong account who was staying at there so called hotel. SO FOR THOSE OUT THERE, BEWARE!!",1.0,1
"Very Friendly, Helpful Staff, Great Location
My husband and I just stayed 4 nights at The James. The staff's warm and welcoming attitudes make this hotel. We would like to give special recognition to Chris, the big guy at the front of the hotel. He was an absolute ray of sunshine, extremely helpful, and so friendly. 
We liked the hotel because it was modern, and well maintained, and has so many tucked away areas that feel like a green oasis in a city full of concrete and steel. The bed was very comfortable, great view from our windows, and great location for shopping, restaurants, and access to adjacent neighborhoods. 
Will absolutely consider staying here again while visitng NYC.

"Park and Fly
We stayed here because of the convenience to the San Diego Airport and their Park and Fly package. The price is quite reasonable, too. Check in was easy and fast. The room was small, but clean, and very warm. Couldn't ever get the temp regulated enough to be comfortable. While the beds looked to be very comfortable, they were not. I found that I did not sleep well, nor did the people with whom I was traveling. Perhaps it was the temperature, but the bed seemed uncomfortable and I awoke with an aching back. 
They not only provide shuttle service to the airport and pickup upon return, but will drive you to Old Town which is close by. We used the shuttle to eat dinner in Old Town and they dropped us right at our restaurant. When we called them to pick us up, they came quickly. Pickup from the airport upon our return was very quick. 
Upon our return from vacation, they offered us complimentary breakfast as it was early morning. They have the best cinnamon rolls anyone could want. It is hard to only eat one. They are moist and flavorful. All-in-all, a good experience when you need a Park and Fly option. I would give this 3.5 stars if this option was available.",3.0,3
"Great budget hostel
Very good location - close to the subway and lots of convenience stores and places to grab some dinner nearby. Beds were comfy (bunk style in the hostel rooms), big communal area downstairs. Each floor had about 4 bathrooms so it was very rare to have to wait for a spare one which was great!
Only complaint would be that wifi was only available in the communal area and not on the upper floors, but despite that I would recommend this place to anyone who wanted a cheap place to sleep in New York.",4.0,4
"Convenient in an emergency
Located right amongst the Longwood Hospitals, walking distance to all. I arrived, following an ambulance late at night and was put in an apartment, as there was no single room available, despite my reservation. Although they accommodated me at the same price, the apartment, though spacious, was run down, dirty, missing the TV in the bedroom, and seemed to be not really rentable. When I asked about the missing TV, they wondered what had happened to it, and offered to move me to a room, rather than replace it. Due the the extreme reason for even being there, I didn't bother. I also discovered that there was no maid service, and the trash was not even emptied. As I was checking out, 3 days later, in a long line, I discovered that many people ahead of me with reservations were being asked for their confirmation #, and if they didn't have one, were told there was no reservation. It was my impression that due to the unpredictable nature of illnesses, death, etc., that they really don't have a reservation system that one can rely on, rather it's 'first come, first served', and the few people who actually remembered to bring their confirmation # were honored ahead of others. Fortunately, I discovered Hospitality Homes, which is a volunteer housing program, servicing patients and their families in the Boston area. I was provided with another place to stay the same day I applied, and was able to leave this hotel. I highly recommend this service! Thank goodness the medical emergency that brought me there was favorably resolved 11 days later!",2.0,2
"Great place for layover or early morning departure
We had a 5:30 AM flight and rather than get up and drive, we stayed the night at the hotel. The location is right next to the airport after the tunnel, so no chance of catching bad traffic. They are also close to many of the rental car returns. My return was close enough (a little tricky with the construction) that I just walked back to the hotel, however I was told that the hotel will also pick up at the rental care return centers. They have a shuttle that leaves every 15 minutes for the terminals, even at 4:15 AM and it worked perfectly. The rooms were clean, large, comfortable and quiet. For the price, the airport location was well worth it.",4.0,4

"Historic hotel in an excellent location
The best thing about this hotel is the location; half way between the White House and Dupont Circle. It is close to all the attractions and all the cool stuff at Dupont Circle. It is also a very historic hotel where everybody who was anybody used to stay, i.e. it is perhaps a bit past it's prime but still a grand old hotel.
Our only real complaint, and a minor one at that, was the service we received from some staff, especially the bell hops. We were returning from trekking in the Himalayas. This was an overnight stopover for us and we had already been travelling for about 24 hours and about 20 of those in the air. So, showing up a little dusty with backpacks we felt we were treated somewhat as second class citizens compared to the ""suits"". That said, the service was still polite and of a decent standard compared to other hotels. The concierge staff were excellent.
A plus was that the rooms are very well lit with a nice bright work desk. There were also a couple power bars which were handy to charge iPods, cel phone, cameras etc etc.",4.0,4

I had a phonecall at home from the Manager discussing what they could provide for me and I wasn't let down in anyway. I had waffles, pancakes, cereals & fruit. It was fantastic, would definitely recommend to anyone who has dietary requirements.
The hotel also provided me with a list of restaurants where I could have a meal in the evening and every restaurant we went in to eat was excellent. Want to go back again in the future.",5.0,5
"I'm giving it three stars because I'm in a good mood.
I waned to take my girlfriend here because she's always dreamed about it. Dreams meet reality. We are well traveled and I've stayed here before, about ten years ago. This place seriously needs to be remodeled. The lobby is classic and ornate, but our suite which we paid dearly for was seriously rundown. Everything is just old old old. For example the fabric in the arm chair was worn out. Really? I realize this is a world renowned landmark, so then they should not hold this place out as 4 1/2 star accommodations because it really isn't. It's a rundown hotel that seriously needs to be revamped. We are here for a few more days and now I will try to change our suite over to the tower area which I have read is less rundown. Then there's the simple things, like the need for a quick area with coffee and snacks and maybe even gifts. They have tons of old retail space here selling Chinese antique pieces, and jewelry, but today's modern traveler wants home away from home with a coffee and snack shop. So my recommendation is to never stay here, but instead walk in and enjoy the ornate lobby and take a few pictures with your traveling companion or friends in the lobby and then move on and stay in a real hotel… It hurts me to say this because I stayed here before and attended grand banquets and had such a good time as a younger man, but this place ain't happening anymore!",3.0,3

"Hotel and town with a difference!
After staying at an enourmous faceless hotel in Vegas the Hotel Erwin was such a lovely surprise. The first thing you notice when you get enter the hotel is the lovely smell of lemongrass everywhere, even in the drivethrough outside. Got an upgrade to a suite which was great, like a small apartment with seperate bedroom and a kitchen area. The room was lovely, very unique and individual with lots of little added touches. The rooftop bar was great with amazing views but it gets very cold up there in the wind, we prefered the cosy, heated little bar in the drivethrough at the front of the hotel. Venice Beach itself was an awesome place but not for the faint hearted! The promenade provided hours of entertainment walking up and down watching the Venice characters perform or just hanging out, we didn't feel intimidated at all but I wouldn't like to walk it after dark. Make sure you visit the Venice canals, just five minutes walk away, such a beatiful peaceful area and so different to the promenade.

The next day, the housekeeper and the front desk tried to convince us that we had left the sign on the door, which was not correct. It was very irritating to see that they were not willing to be responsible for their mistakes. 
The kitchen area was also full of ants. We alerted the front desk and nothing was done about it in our absence. I was very glad to leave.

This is a clean, modern and convenient hotel and I really like it, it was my third stay within a year BUT after we returned home . . . we received two additional charges which were not reflected on the bill.

They say we checked in at 8:03 am (we basically drove in straight from airport to drop off luggage and lucked out by having one room ready) and left at 1:55pm on the day we left (they allowed us a late checkout). The funny thing is that most of the time the car wasn't even there as we're driving around PLUS one night they actually didn't want to get our car and advised us to take a taxi (as the hotel was really busy and there wasn't any room in the driveway for any more cars) . . . they said ""you need to give us at least 20 minutes to get your car"". Conclusion - they need to state that they charge overtime parking rates OR don't stay there if you have a car OR don't bother tipping them as the valets will get the money in another way.",3.0,3
"Best Hotel Stay
I've stayed in quite a few hotels in many different cities, but this was undoubtedly the most comfortable hotel stay I've ever had. I had to stay in Boston for one night on an icy, snowy, rainy night, and had wanted to stay in the Back Bay but found the prices far too high. I chose Hotel Commonwealth because I was familiar with the great restaurants connected to it -- Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster. The reservation staff was polite, courteous and kept asking what could be done to make me more comfortable. When I arrived, the incredibly nice staff knew of my requests (which doesn't happen often) and said that they were already in my room--truly one of the largest hotel rooms and hotel bathrooms that I've ever seen. I followed with a fantastic dinner at Eastern Standard, walked around the photography gallery that connected the two, did some window shopping in the jewelry store that is also connected to the hotel, and watched a movie on the DVD player in the room. I never had to leave the interior on a cold night, and had the nicest overall experience. Although the oversized windows overlooked part of the Mass Pike highway, I never heard any traffic. The location turned out to be perfect, and since Boston really isn't an oversized city, I was only a 5minute cab ride to my location. It might have been farther if in the Back Bay given the one-way streets. After my stay, I saw the amazing and well deserved reviews on Tripadvisor.

"Very uncomfortable hotel that's lost it's way!
My husband and I have just returned from a Wedding Anniversary weekend in New York City. it was the first time that we'd been on holiday without the children (4years) so we were looking forward to partying late into the night and having long lazy days in ""The Loft"" (60 Thompson's equivalent to a Penthouse Suite). 60 Thompson seemed the perfect choice due to it's location and the apparent luxury of The Loft.... how wrong we were! 
Firstly, I think it's worth noting that the girls at the Concierge were fantastic, friendly and would go ""the extra mile"" and managed to get us into nearly all of the bars, restaurants and club that we requested. 
However, everything else about the hotel was very below par:
1. The layout of The loft seemed to be designed for a business man that doesn't have many toiletries, rather than a couple or a woman. There was one small shelf in the bathroom, only just enough space for moisturisers, toothbrushes, toothpaste and mouthwash. We had to remove the complementary cotton wool, cotton buds and drink glasses from the bathroom into the bedroom in order to make room for our toiletries (this made the bedroom area very cluttered immediately). 
2. The bath was 3/4 the size of a normal bath. Obviously in a city where space is tight you would expect small baths in hotels but certainly not in the best room in the house. 
3. In the shower there were two small shower-heads, one of which was plastic!
4. Also quite shockingly both the bath and shower had shower curtains rather than transparent doors... I would always worry about the hygiene of having shower curtains in hotel rooms. 
5. After I had my first shower I obviously needed to dry my hair and straiten my hair but there were no power sockets next to the full-length mirror. I called reception and asked them to find a solution but the response that I received was that guests used the power sockets in the bathroom for the hairdryers and irons!!! I was flabbergasted as you will hardly ever find power sockets in bathrooms in the UK because of the health and safety implications, especially when you have to balance hot hair irons on a wet sink! 
6. I had the same problem when I needed to apply my make-up. Whenever I've stayed in hotel suites I've had a dressing table with a mirror... but not at the 60 Thompson! There was a desk but alas no mirror. During my previous conversation with reception about hairdryers I did ask them if they had a desk mirror that I could place on the desk so that I could apply my make-up in a normal fashion... the response was negative.... apparently women apply their make-up under the false light of the bathroom. 
7. The bed was presented nicely but the mattress was about 8inches too small for the bed itself, so our pillows ended up on the floor between the gap in the headboard and mattress covered in dust!!!! 
8. Attention to detail in our room was severely lacking.... one of the staircase lights was broken when we arrived and didn't get fixed for the duration of our stay even-though we had informed the management. 
9. The room service food was terrible, especially the breakfasts. The burger and fries was so terrible that when we needed food in our room we ordered a delivery pizza - coincidentally we saw another guest taking a pizza back to his room. 
10. on our last day I asked for a pot of tea for our room but I wanted large mugs (same as what they used for coffee). I was told that this wasn't possible as all of the large mugs smelt of coffee and they couldn't get rid of the smell - I suggested they wash them properly. 
11. The bar was beyond noisy and quite cold. We wanted a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar but the DJ was on early and the decibels were comparable to the nightclub that we were at later that evening. 
12. There was only one doorman at the door at anyone time, so this was a problem if several guests needed cabs hailing at the same time... in the end we would walk up the street and find one ourselves. Out of all the doormen we met, we only really got good service from one of them. 
13. I had phoned the General Manager several times during our stay and left a voicemail for him but I didn't receive a call back from him. On our final day I was quite furious and asked to speak to the Duty Manager. When I finally made contact with the Duty Manager he told me that the General Manager doesn't work on weekends and he hadn't been working on the Friday either. I gave the Duty Manager our list of grievances, he was very apologetic but he said that he didn't have the power to address any of them! I told him that we'd been given a guaranteed late check-out upon booking (we were due to leave for the airport at 6pm) but he said that he couldn't let us have the room after 3.30pm. His solution to this was to give us the best available room in the hotel to leave our bags, freshen up and relax in until we needed to leave for the airport. We accepted his suggestion but we were left dumbfounded by the box-room that he'd given us... it was extremely small, dark and hugely depressing, we stayed there for all of 1 minute and decided to walk the busy streets of NYC for 2 1/2 hours. 
14. When we checked-out (they didn't give us a discount to compensate for very poor service and sub-standard ""best room in the house"") the Duty Manager said that the General Manager would call us the next day.... one week on and we haven't heard from him..!
I hope this will be helpful for anyone thinking of staying at 60 Thompson. I certainly wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend it. We hugely regret staying there.",1.0,1

Space is not large enough but there's a tiny living area (sofa, tv, ref). I was surprised (in a good way) about the toiletries because they were known brands and not some generic crappy hotel products.
We also ate at Tavern101 at the ground floor. Their crab cakes are really good. All meat and no starchy fillers.
Overall, I am happy with the hotel. Until I lost my backpack. I know valuables are the responsibility of the owner, but I was disappointed by how easily a bag can get lost/stolen in the hotel's shared spaces. I just laid down my bag on the floor while our group was getting coffee near the breakfast area. It was in the evening and there was just my group and a couple of guests going to the elevator. When I got to our room and realized my bag is missing, I immediately ran and took the elevator (room is on 2nd floor) and searched for it. It was no longer there. All happening in less than an hour!. Front Desk asked the staff if they found a bag, and that's it. She didn't ask for my name, my room, how my bag looked like. I had to go back and ask Front Desk if there's any way we can review the video monitor in that area. I was only told there's none in that hall and I had to wait for the manager, who has the only access to the video logs, in the morning, at 11AM! 
I spoke with the next shift at the Front Desk in the morning and she was more helpful. She took down my name and contact number and a description of the backpack, and contacted the Lost & Found staff. Way better response than the one at the Front Desk the night before! The other staff I spoke with (incl. the lost & found guy) reacted like it's a lost case. No initiative, no effort.
Thankfully, my backpack did not have passports and important documents and valuables. It was my baby's diaper bag, and her essential feeding stuff were there. :(",2.0,2
"Nice but almost too big for its own good
Let me start by saying that i really enjoyed my stay at the Omni Dallas. The only negatives stem from it being a large hotel and at the moment, very trendy so it is very busy and crowded. As a Omni Select Guest member I bypass the front desk check-in so I cannot comment on that experience.
The rooms are very spacious and great floor to ceiling windows looking out to the Dallas skyline. As a new hotel everything is clean and up to date. The room could have better controls for the lighting since there is a lot of it. I think there were at least 6 lamps in the room. Also, electronic controls for the shades would have been a nice touch. The hotel has several options for restaurants and the Owner's Box sports bar was great.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone but just know that it is likely to have a bit of a hectic feel to the main areas of the hotel.",4.0,4
"Worst hotel I have ever stayed at.
My colleague and I rented two rooms through Priceline - we big on a three star hotel. I'd give it less than one. Cockroaches in both our rooms. His shower didn't work and had no bath towels. They gave him a second room in the morning to shower in and the tub didn't drain. I had fast food wrappers under my bed, nail clippings on my bed, and the rug clearly hadn't been vacuumed. They were plenty quick to provide a full refund. And, when I expressed my surprise at the star rating the front desk clerk helpfully pointed out that star ratings are based on amentities, not quality. It seemed like she'd heard the complaints before.",1.0,1
"Poor & Over-priced
My friend and I stayed on 7th floor for a total of 6 nights on business.
Hardware: The doors and walls are paper thin. I can hear water running from next room and people talking every word out in the corridor. The retractable door slams every time all day and can be heard especially all morning.
Cleaning: Evidently the maid made no attempts to vacuum the room or bathroom. No turndown service, but I think the bed was hardly made every day. Hair in the bathroom stays all week had I not picked them up.
Gym: Extra charge?? at already an expensive hotel rate
Lobby: The Starbucks in the foyer is like a bar. Not clean by hotel standards. Very busy and noisy well into midnight.
The mortal sin: Friend received surprise flowers but ABSOLUTELY NO ATTEMPT in delivering them even after 3 DAYS! WTF!!?? I do not understand what kind of hotel it is. No card under the door to inform or anyone making attempts to notify or deliver. This is shameful service. It was only after my friend knew and asked that they gave it to her, without even bothering to take up to room.
Maid: I think knocking on the door at 930am on a Sunday morning to try to clean the room is a bit much.
In-room supplies: no slippers, no bathroom, in fact no anything close to great service at all. You get your soap and shampoo, that's it.
STAFF: Professional & courteous but otherwise totally let down by poor standards.
One of the worst international chain hotels I stayed at considering the brand name.",1.0,1
"Excellent business class hotel
If you travel frequently for business, most hotels start to look alike. The Hilton Indianapolis stood out and is an excellent value when rooms can be had for around $150. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are much larger than the typical hotel room. My room, which seemed to be a regular one (not a suite) had a separate sitting area with sofa, desk, two chairs, and a TV. The bed had both foam and feather pillows--a nice touch. I also really like the Peter Thomas Roth bath products.
On the down side, the decor, especially in the halls, is tired. But I found the entire hotel to be clean and well maintained. I would stay there again.",5.0,5
"Great location!
Chose this hotel on the basis of the Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed, great location, really nicely appointed room, staff could not have been more helpful, and a surprise left in our room with a hand written note to congratulate us on our anniversary. Really could not fault the place, will stay there again whenever I get the chance. Great location for Broadway and for exploring Manhatten.",5.0,5
"If you want to feel like you're bothering the staff, stay here..
OK, positives first! This place is right in Midtown, and we received the booking at an excellent price through a travel site. The weather was freezing but the hotel was always warm, our rooms were very well cleaned everyday, and the shared bathrooms were clean and tidy as well. NO bedbugs which is a huge plus! So...negatives. And the reason why I gave it a 2 score: the front staff! SO RUDE. It was only one guy we dealt with both times we had to (check-in and out) and he was the rudest guy ever, he really made us feel like we did things wrong and he didn't want us there! We were an adult group who are very tidy and quiet so no, it wasn't us. This plus the freaking noise made it a couple of days of not being able to sleep. The hotel was warm, sure. But it was SO HOT that we had to open the window all night just to sleep and of course, the outside noise made that impossible. Our group was split into several rooms and although we were all paying the same price, some rooms were great and some were really crap. All in all, I think there are better places in the city with a similar price, and I personally would never recommend this place or stay here again.",2.0,2
"Not sure where all the good reviews are coming from!
We stayed here when we were in Austin for 2 nights because it was so highly rated on trip advisor. To give the management their due the service was faultless, to compensate for a mix up in our booking (their fault) they put us in the Longhorn suite for no extra cost (i have no idea if it should have cost extra or if the room rates are all the same!)
Beyond the courteous staff the hotel has very little to offer. The corridor outside our room smelt horribly of very strong food. The inside of the room was musty and didn't seem particularly clean, especially the longhorn memorabilia.
Of course this is a cheap motel and as such can't provide luxury, but we wouldn't stay here again no matter how good a deal it was.",2.0,2
"Please take this review into consideration before booking at the State Plaza Hotel.
I created a TripAdvisor account just to write this review of the State Plaza Hotel, where I stayed this week to my great regret. I cannot pretend that my experience would be representative of all stays at this hotel, but it was so bad in enough areas that I think it warrants consideration by anyone who is trying to decide whether to book a room at this place.
I will grant that the room was reasonably clean, the bed was reasonably comfortable, and the building is reasonably located. It was everything else, however, that diminished any redeeming value that these qualities might have lent to the hotel.
First, I stayed at this hotel at the tail end of record-breaking high temperatures in D.C. that were comparable to summer weather in the city. In spite of this fact, the hotel literally refused to turn on the air conditioning, arguing that the hotel was equipped only with single pipe air controls. Until the temperatures were high enough -- with 80-degree highs that week, I wonder how much hotter it has to get for the hotel to be satisfied -- the management would leave the heat on and not turn on the air. When I called the front desk to request that they turn on the air conditioning, they simply told me to open the window and turn on a floor fan that the hotel provided. 
I honestly do not understand how the hotel believes that it could in good conscience subject its guests to these kinds of conditions. It is difficult to describe how miserable it was to lie in bed, trying to will myself to fall asleep while sweating profusely in a muggy and overheated room. It is also difficult to describe how uncomfortable it was to open the window when the only view out of the room was into the neighboring embassy and its residents. Even more difficult to describe is how I awoke at the crack of dawn, completely startled by the deafening sound of the garbage truck picking up dumpsters in the alleyway outside. Before I realized the source of the commotion, I mistakenly thought someone was hacking his way into my mediocre sauna of a room. 
My stay would perhaps not have been as horrific if I had at least been able to take comfort in a nice shower in my room. Unfortunately, the shower drain was not just slow -- it was so clogged and backed up that literally within seconds of turning on the water, the tub would begin filling up. Every three or four minutes, I would have to turn off the water completely, stand in the shower with the water off, and wait about four minutes for the water to drain out so that I would not run the risk of spilling the water out of the tub into the rest of the bathroom. 
My most significant complaint, and the primary reason for my writing this review, was the poor quality of service at the hotel. Perhaps the staff is more capable when asked to give directions to the Newseum, but I found them totally incompetent at fielding basic requests. I would have to ask them at least three times to do something before it would actually be handled. For example, when I called about the air conditioning, the front desk suggested that I use a fan. I asked if they had a fan, but they told me they were unsure and would have to call me back because it was not clear if they had a functional fan to give guests. If they had notice that the weather would be hot, as it had been for days, and that the management refused to turn on the air conditioning, why would the staff not adequately prepare to hand out fans to guests immediately, especially since they suggested these as a remedy? Ultimately, it took several calls to guest services and a couple of conversations at the front desk before I was even able to obtain a fan for the room. 
By the middle of my first night, sleeping in the room became torturous. When I called the front desk to ask that the air conditioning be turned on, I was assured by the night manager that it would be turned on the next day. Of course, this promise turned out to be too good to be true -- the night manager was just saying that so people would stop calling him to complain. All the hotel did the next day was turn on the fan in the window unit, which circulated lukewarm air around the room. Even this episode raises the question of why, if this was a possibility, the hotel's management did not resort to this method (however unsatisfactory) sooner. It appears from my conversation with the night manager, who expressed disagreement with the overall management's decision to keep the air conditioning off, that the State Plaza Hotel's management prioritizes cost-cutting over the basic comforts and needs of its guests.
I had to stay two nights at the hotel, and although the first day and night made me lose most of my confidence in the staff's ability, I maintained some hope that maybe they could fix the shower drain in my room so I could at least have a decent shower after working and walking around all day in the heat. I informed the front desk shortly after 7 am that I would be gone for the day and that the tub drain was in dire need of repairs. Since I made this request only once, the task obviously was not completed, and on my second night I found myself once again taking a shower in standing water.
I understand from previous reviews that other guests have managed to enjoy their stays. I do think that is possible, despite my experience. But I would also say that although this review seems to cover only an extreme situation, the indifference demonstrated by the State Plaza Hotel's management, exacerbated by the incompetence of its staff, leads me to urge any potential guests to consider other options very seriously.",1.0,1
"Back again to excellent experience
If there is a greater pleasure than discovering great hospitality, it is returning to confirm that first impressions were true.
My recent stay at the Palomar on Wilshire in Westwood was most agreeable in every way. The knowledge that once I cleared the Los Angeles' airport and its feeder freeway that feeds on one's time,the 405, that what awaited me was welcome comfort (or comforting welcome) of the hotel, propelled me to its front door and cheerful staff.
My room was perfect, the gym vital, the elevator greetings testimony to the high quality of my fellow guests, and for the first time, I did my business by inviting folks to breakfast and lunch at the cafe...which they were happy to do! And I didn't have to drive all over L.A!
And thus discovered how many pleasures were in walking distance of the Hotel. Final hint; if a guest wants to visit Beverly Hills to see Ferrari's and Bentley's in their native habitat, or sample cosmetics in the manicured hands of Nieman Marcus demonstrator ladies, take the bus right down Wilshire and let someone else worry about parking.
O.K. That concludes my remarks. I will be back at the Hotel in early June wearing one of my five Adidas ensembles. Please greet me!",5.0,5
"Terrible experience
I was extremely disappointed in this motel. I was embarrassed for myself and my friends. When a paddy wagon cruises the parking lot on Friday and Saturday night, doesn't give you a secure feeling. The rooms were not ready when I checked in at 4:30 PM. Both rooms had a very unpleasant order. Telephones were disgusting. The carpets were dirty and stained. The bedspreads had holes and the blankets were rough feeling. Pillows were flat. There were not enough towels. No soap. Bathroom door stuck. One toilet, you had to flush at least three times before the bowl emptied. The other, you had to remove the top and pull the level inside the tank to flush. One sink was slow in draining. I did speak with the Front Desk and about the toilet and sink and Maintenance fixed the next day. The rooms were not cleaned the next day. I called the Front Desk to find out why and was told Housekeeping doesn't make up the beds with items on them. Both rooms didn't have anything on them other than the sheets, blankets, and bedspreads. No clean towels. I had to go to the Front Office to get them. Tom Bodett didn't leave the light in this Motel 6.",1.0,1
"Antarctica by day; Tropics by night
Nice hotel and great location, but the heating/cooling system is the craziest I have ever encountered. We were told upon check in that there was a dual air system that we could not adjust. Huh? Our stay was in October and the weather was sunny and lovely in the upper 60s in the daytime. Our room, however, had extreme fluctuations in the temperature. By day, cold air was blowing continually so that the room temp was below 50 degrees. We were freezing. When we came back from dinner, heat was blowing to the point that in the middle of the night, it was 89 degrees in the room and we were left sweating and unable to sleep. Like a hot, humid night in NYC with no air conditioning. Forced air was noisy too. No way for the guest to alter individual room temps so you go from freezing to sauna temperatures. Who came up with this system for controlled air? Unbearable.",2.0,2
"Unusual Property
There are two buildings, the main hotel and the Lofts. The latter is adjacent to the main building and is accessed via an outdoor passage. We stayed in the Lofts. The room was fine, spacious and clean, no problems there. The unusual feature is the air conditioning. There is no central air conditioning. Instead there is a large portable unit, rather noisy, which sits on the floor up against a wall and vents to a window. I guess something must be really wrong with the heating system for the whole building. The location is great, it's close to the Convention Center, but negatives include very small lobby and overpriced breakfast menu. Unfortunately there are no nearby diners for breakfast.",3.0,3
"Last resort
Unfortunately travelling with a larger family (6) and looking for last minute accommodation on a budget, there weren't many options. We only needed a night to recharge before hitting Universal and much to my wife and mothers delight, one night is all we spent. 
The main 'plus' of this place was the close proximity to Universal Studios. 
As a 'make do' family, the 3 Queen beds were surprisingly comfortable albeit a little noisy as the mattresses were still wrapped in plastic. The Air con units worked, they were noisy but we were too stuffed to care anyway. Bathroom was simple and clean. The breakfast offered was juice, crap coffee and pastries. Parking was free, if you were lucky enough to get one of the 14 or so spaces from which only 2 could accommodate a family vehicle. 
The friendliest face seemed to be the maids who always smiled. My poor service rating is due to the guy at the desk who had the personality of a brick. Think he needs a 'Disney Experience' to liven up.",3.0,3

The hotel was very old but clean. The staff was outstanding and very nice and helpful. I think the hotel should upgrade the televisions.

Service: The worst I had ever experienced. The Indian fellow aforementioned by the previous reviews, was extremely rude. Ownership needs to take a look at these reviews and make some serious changes. Terrible service. Very confrontational and extremely ignorant.

Due to mechanical problems, our flight was late to Houston, and all passengers missed their connecting flights.

There was not even an comforter, just a stained sheet. It was late and even my exhaustion from a day of travel could not get me to touch anything in that room.

Negative comments: front desk people were unhelpful and hmmm....unfriendly (smiled but didn't mean it). Pool hours too limited. I wanted to work out before business meetings. Not possible as they opened pool at 9 am. When I returned in evening, pool filled with non-swimmers just standing around and talking. Need lap lane or lap hours designated. Work out room small with limited equipment- treadmill/stepper. My room had no desk. Website said every room had a desk. Hotel staff apologetic and said it was an old hotel. Excuse me! Desks have been around for several thousand years! Room had a TV, hair dryer and coffee maker....but no desk! When I booked I told them I was there on business & verified wifi. Never thot to ask about a DESK! Went to lobby to work, but no outlets at tables. Lobby smelled of urine in areas and cigar smoke....nasty! Need to get cigar store out of the hotel. Smokers need to be further from facility....tried to have a glass of wine and sit in courtyard rocking chairs with associates in evenings, but smokers arrived and polluted the air. Maybe smokers could have their own area in the parking garage. Got an ok rate for booking early....overpriced otherwise. Would go again with caveats.",4.0,4

I do not recommend using this hotel if you are ever in LA. It is not really near anything. It will be a long cab or expensive shuttle to the Walk of Fame, Dodger Stadium, the beach, or the airport.

"Convenient but to be repeated!
This was my second stay at this Sheraton due to the fact that our daughter will be going to college in Boston. This hotel is conveniently located, close to the school, Newbury (which I love), and the Prudential Center Shoppes. The first time we stayed, I found a great rate at the Club level. Being in the club is not all that exclusive, other than the fact that you have a very very basic self-serve breakfast, a quieter floor, and a little more private elevators going to this level.
This time around, the rate was similar, but we stayed in the ""normal"" hotel....no club services. The hotel was very busy with the hustle-bustle of college kids and their parents going and coming with boxes and plenty of luggage. That is okay, and I must say, we were in the same boat. You could see worried-looking parents with their very excited teenagers.
 This is also a hotel with families and many conventions going on. 
I do have to say, I was very very unpleasantly surprised to have seen a Tatoo Convention on this particular weekend. The crowd was rowdy, and not particularly family friendly. We stayed on the 15th floor, and had so much noise from the upper floor at very late hours( 2:00am- 4:00am). People seemed to be screaming and jumping on their beds...or so it seemed from the amount of noise.
I must say that the ambience of the hotel changed in such a way that I really must think about repeating my stay here. Too bad the bad experience outweighed the convenience of the location. I guess I will be looking to other horizons for my next stay in this beautiful city.",3.0,3

I certainly couldn't beat my rate (though it was ironic that parking was 1/2 the price of the room - that's what you expect for the location so see if you can get away without a car).

This hotel should not be in business. They have no idea how to make a guest feel comfortable when away from home which is the whole point of the hotel business.

No clock or radio -- again, when I asked they said ""most of our guests don't really need one."" Oh really? So I asked for a wake up call instead -- never happened. When I asked to use their business center computer, they said it was ""out of order."" There was no tourist info, no restaurant info, no help for out of towners like us. We had to ask for fresh towels and to have our trash emptied. These people were the least accommodating I have ever encountered. On top of it all, we had originally booked this hotel as The Comfort Inn and Suites and when we got there it had become the Acme Hotel.

"Grand Name, Not Grand Westin
As a Platinum SPG member, I hold Westin to a certain level of service. I understand NYC is recovering from Hurricane Sandy days before my arrival. But, simple, communications should be available.
Specifically asked @ Business Center before arriving, was informed by your staff via email, exact location, & would have access. Arrived to find out it is not open, currently a storage closet, can use the 'hallway' as a work location.
Your restaurant/bar is not open, SPG breakfast perk, not a perk, 8 small pieces of fruit, 3 pieces of toast and coffee, really?!
Needed a refrigerator for specific items that have to stay cold, profile indicates this requirement. Was informed NO, and none would be provided I will be changed if I take anything out of the wet-bar.
From a security point, make sure you keep the door latch on, as the maid service will knock once as the are walking into your room. They didn't wait for an answer on 3 of the days, just started walking in the room.
Needed directions to MetLife stadium, asked the front desk to leave message for Concierge service to provide me the information under my door in the morning or call me after a specific time in the morning, was informed I would have to go talk with them in the morning as they are not around 'at this time' Sorry, that is a simple request, leave them a note, a guest should be able to request a note be put in their inbox.

There were no cups of any kind in the room. I called downstairs and was sent some cups up fairly quickly. I was visiting for a trade show 10/15-10/18 and I went downstairs to meet some associates for a while. When I returned I noticed the door to my room was not locked. The reason why was there was some damage to the inside frame which would cause the door not to lock shut unless it was pulled very tight. I did not pull it tight because these heavy style doors are meant to shut and lock when pulled towards closing. This happened to me again one night as I slept but I did have the inside latch pulled over as a safety lock. What was most troubling was I did notify a male employee working on the floor that gave me the impression he might have been in maintenance but I did not specifically ask. I showed him the door damage and he said the hotel was aware of the problem. The issue was never fixed during my stay. I was in room 1019. That alone caused your low rating but there was more. The TV in my bedroom never worked. When you turn it on you simply get a flash on the screen that said something like trying to acquire signal. That is the TV I would have liked to relax in bed and watch the baseball playoffs or the presidential debates. You did a good job with breakfast and happy hour. I'm not sure why I could not get 2 glasses on wine, one for me and one for an associate sitting at the table but I guess there is a logical reason related to liability. I thought your elevators were very efficient for a large full property. In fairness if I stayed again you probably would be better than 2 stars but you have to fix room issues that could be a safet concern. That room be out of service until the door is repaired. Is it still damaged?",2.0,2
"Fantastic Experience
I stayed here June 23,2012 to July 20, 2012...almost a month. I travel for a living AND work nights. Housekeeping was FANTASTIC on accomodating my schedule. Beautiful property. Back patio and pool are probably the nicest Ive seen. Cushioned open air seating with fire pit. Covered pagoda style seating with BBQ grills. 
Clean, comfortable and ALL staff were friendly and courteous. I particularly want to call out the Director of Sales Lynette Deihl. I travel with a group and she was particularly helpful in securing our accomodations. The most surprising aspect came when I casually mentioned to her that my group would be moving on to our next city. The next morning in my email I had a list of Staybridge Suites in the area we were travelling to, specific room types for my groups needs, prices and short reviews. Her email closed with ""Let me know..and I will make the arrangements"". WOW!
If your travelling to the Stone Oak area in San Antonio as a group, an individual, or a couple, I HIGHLY reccomend this hotel and Lynette. Awesome customer service.",5.0,5
"Nice hotel but front desk staff could be more ample
This was my first stay at this property as a colleague selected it. I liked the location as it was convenient to downtown as well as some other spots we needed to visit off Preston Road. There was a nice bar in the lobby. The fitness room was good and had ample machines. My only negative was on the availability of front desk staff. In fairness, there was a large group staying with them during my visit so that did back them up; however, if you know you have a large group, then you bring in extra staff to handle the crowd or you handle their check-in separately.",3.0,3
"Salisbury is an excellent choice!
We stayed here for a third time recently for 4 nights. It was perfect as usual. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The bellman even took us down the freight elevator when checking out to save us some time and Nick was very knowledgeable when checking in about recommendations. We had a very quiet stay and the location is unbeatable. I love this hotel and we hope it's always here for us when we visit.",5.0,5
"Friendly Staff, Good Location
Staff is very friendly. Location is excellent for people working on Wall Street/Brooklyn. Lift can be annoying sometimes, however, isn't a biggie. Rooms are decent sized. Are bigger than other doubletrees i have stayed. On the whole, it is nice package. 
For me, I would come back, coz staff is very friendly.",4.0,4
"Not a great hotel!!!!
It was not the worst hotel that I have stayed in, but it really was not that great a place. We arrived very late at night and when we entered our room the air conditioning was not working. The front desk person came up and reset the unit, which worked for 5 minutes but then proceeded to stop again after the 5 minutes. We had to be up for a dance competition in 5 hours so we had to sleep with the window open, thankfully it was only in the 60's. We complained to the front desk before we left for the day and when we got back later that night it was working. The room was very outdated, except for the new flat screen tv they apparently just put into all the rooms. The pool was dirty, you could not see the bottom because it was so cloudy. The breakfast was ok, it was like all hotels give you cereal, make your own waffles, toast, eggs and sausage, juice and coffee. There was not enough staff on site, when you called the front desk or went down to it no one was ever around and you had to wait for someone to come back.",2.0,2
"Done with this hotel
I'm a Hilton Diamond member which means I stay 60+ nights a year at Hilton properties. I have stayed at this Hilton countless times and each time, I seem to have the same service issues over and over. In virtually every other Hilton (rather than the Hilton New York on 53rd and 6th) the front desk blocks a room for me based on my profile. Last week, I checked in and they had me in a double bed room, un-renovated, on the 2nd floor. You have to know this hotel to know that it is probably the worst room type they have. This has happened repeatedly whereas the room I'm given is on the lowest end of their inventory. This should not be happening with their Diamond members. Additionally, in each recent stay at this hotel, I have found someone else's hair in the shower/tub of the bathroom. That happens to be the biggest hotel violations I can think of- it's just disgusting and nobody wants that. Last week after reporting it to the front desk, it still hadn't been cleaned by housekeeping. To boot, they took the coffee makers out of the room. Nothing like taking away one of the most important ammenities you can find in a hotel room. Seriously, this hotel is too big to pay attenion to things like service, ammenities and cleanliness. Goodbye Hilton New York.",2.0,2
"Great service at Frank & Alberts
If you want a truly enjoyable dining experience for breakfast, lunch, or dinner make sure to request one of Maria's tables. You will experience top notch service and a great attitude. We stayed at the resort with our kids, friends and their kids and we all loved our two day stay at the resort. If you are looking for a great steak at Frank & Alberts ask Maria for the ""Andy"" Special.",5.0,5
"Exactly what I needed!
I stayed here for a week in april for business on campus. I was VERY pleasantly surprised! I had prettylow expectations, and was a little worried upon arrival to the slightly tired and worn lobby and hallways. But the rooms are more modern than the outside, don't be scared off by the outside! 
The bed is surprisingly really comfy and the room was very dark and relatively quiet at night so slept very well. All the good channels on the tv. Bathroom has aged but all very clean, decent towels which are replaced daily if you'd like. 
Perfect location, right near bus terminal to downtown/ hollywood, (both met buses), and Santa Monica (big blue buses). Also the UCLA campus bus stops right outside. Staff at reception 24 hours and were always happy to answer questions, even show me the vending machine upstairs which i couldn't find upstairs on my own! They even gave me a list of nearby restaurants which deliver to the hotel which was great when arriving back at the hotel after a long day and wanting to order a pizza.
Breakfast was simple but again, much better thani expected. Bagels, toast, meats, cheeses, muffins & pastires + coffee/tea/juice. WIFI is also unbeatable, no password required - works well on phone and lap top (including skype video streaming).
DEFINITELY recommend it if you need to visit campus to visit children/look at the college/for business! 
Much better than I ever imagined!",4.0,4
"Hip and busy hotel.
The hotel was pretty fab; I had my two teen sons with me and perhaps this is a better place for swanky couples and singles who can live it up at the free champagne hour every evening. The metro is quite a walk in this heat wave, but the DC Circulator bus stop was very close. I was thankful for the cold water in the lobby, but felt strange about getting a cup of tea or coffee...no one had explained the breakfast going-ons and there wasn't anything about it in the room. The staff were extremely busy multitasking and I felt like I couldn't ask them mundane questions like about breakfast or how to open the mini-fridge (it was locked). Many of the guests were so demanding of the desk staff, I wanted to tell the guests ""shame on you"" for their rudeness and foul mouths. Like most businesses, I guess they can't afford to have enough staff and keep costs low. 
For the room, it was clean, deliciously cold (in this heat wave!) and comfortable. Even though we heard our neighbors while walking in the hall listening to music, our room was pretty soundproof. All-in-all a good room in an expensive city.",4.0,4
"Great place to stay!
I stayed there 1/21-1/25 for business, and enjoyed the place immensly. The landscaping is beautiful, the restaurants are superb. My wife and I also went also to the Desert Botanical gardens, and hiked Camelback mtn. both of which are close. A huge shopping center with many restuarants are within 2 miles (less) which means convienance. I would recommend it.",5.0,5
"The Setai Fifth Avenue is a fabulous addition to NYC luxury hotels!
My friends and I had a ""spa weekend"" at The Setai Fifth Avenue and it was simply amazing! The rooms were awesome (spacious, modern with fabulous bathrooms & great products!), the spa treatments were terrific & the spa itself was huge for NYC with plenty of space to lounge around, pools, saunas & steam rooms ...and very friendly & accommodating staff. We had dinner right in the hotel at Ai Fiori, which was beyond delicious and an exquisite dining experience! All in all, it was an amazing experience and the 4 of us highly recommend this luxurious hotel!",5.0,5
"Alan's review
The Warick Hotel is very clean and comfortable and the location is great It is however quite expensive as is the hotel's restaurant ,staff are very polite and helpful, the double beds are not very wide for 2 adults and the roon was not serviced until after 2pm each day not so good if like me you like a nap after lunch. Other than that it was an enjoyable stay. If it was a bit cheaper I would go back",3.0,3
"Charming Historic Inn
This hotel is a very special place conveniently located in Uptown Charlotte. Walk to many businesses and attractions and enjoy beautifully appointed accomodations. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is wonderful and the hotel even has an antique taxi to shuttle you around town. In a word, this place is superb!",5.0,5
"Dinghy and tired
The suite was large, but very rundown. Appliances were old and out of date. Poor shower. A real lack of attention to traveler's needs exists here. There was no coffee at the coffee bar in the morning. I asked when they ran out and they said they ran out the day before. There are two elevators, one of which is a service elevator during prime checkout time. I waited ten minutes for an elevator, then finally took an up elevator, because they were always full when they got down to my floor. The only good thing about this place is its location.",2.0,2
"This place is AWFUL.
Definitely NOT a 3.5 star, as advertised on Priceline. The rooms are ridiculously small (not even enough space to do pushups on the floor without my elbows hitting the wall). It barely accomodates the bed (with a foot to spare on each side). You have to climb on top of the bed just to open the one window. I'm fit, not fat, but I was still scraping against the bathroom doorway when going into and out of the bathroom. Don't expect any amenities like fridge, microwave, or even a coffee maker... they aren't here!! The desk is smaller than a 2x4 and the chair is a cheap, hard, aluminum chair. The shower only has a glass partition between the actual shower and the bed area. THIS HOTEL SHOULD BE BARRED FROM PRICELINE, OR SHOULD HAVE ITS STAR RATING LOWER TO 1 OR 2 STARS. Even more aggravating, I received numerous ""price alerts"" from Priceline saying that there are other 3 and 4 star hotels in Midtown for under $80/night. I've stayed at numerous other 3 star hotels in Midtown and the rooms were all much bigger and much nicer. No free coffee downstairs here either (it is $5 in the breakfast restaurant). This place is really more a ""hostel,"" not a ""hotel."" Also, most of the towels had hair on them or were stained. The first room I was given had a lock on the door which was half-broken (could be opened by inserting something into the door frame). The lobby is full of ""trendy,"" gimmicky things (like a vending machine that contains $20 toothbrushes or $8000 photo shoot vouchers). PATHETIC!!!",1.0,1
"Best location in Manhattan
Our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn was overall very positive. The location cannot be beat. A subway stop is immediately outside the door for the A-C-E lines. Other subway stops are easy walking distance for other lines. Many good restaurants are within 2-3 blocks. It is centrally located with Soho to the north for shopping and great restaurants. Downtown is a 10 minute walk with the World Trade Center, riverfront, Battery Park, etc. Crowds are MUCH less than in tourist meccas like Times Square. Taxis were readily available at all times. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. The front desk staff always greeted us warmly and they appeared to all have excellent English language skills. They were helpful in answering questions about subway tickets and also made restaurant recommendations. Cleaning staff are mostly foreign and do not speak any English. We did not try the restaurant in the hotel.
Our room was clean and comfortable. We had a nice view of the city streets- we could see to Canal Street, Avenue of the Americas and Beach Street. The room is small but this is typical of ALL New York hotel rooms. It had a small refrigerator, microwave and desk. We had plenty of drawer space. We slept great and especially appreciated that we could set the room fan to run all night as a noisemaker. We did not test the special adjustable beds. 
I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC.",5.0,5
"Just OK
The hotels facade is uninviting, with the entrance resembling a car park. Parking is expensive at $25 per day, but the valet attendants were efficient and friendly mannered. The corridors are extremely outdated with the carpet practically threadbare in the tread ways. 
Our room (I'm guessing they're all like this) was on the sad side of OK. Our Non smoking room reeked of smoke. No fridge in the room makes it difficult to keep milk cold for children, not to mention keeping cold a few bevies that are obligatory in the evening whilst on holiday. No glasses in the room, only throw away plastic cups. Limited complimentary toiletry range. Very, very limited choice in TV channels. As others have mentioned, this hotel needs to be gutted and renovated for it to be worth the tariff.
WARNING IF YOU ARE LODGING WITH CHILDREN: keep them away from the windows. Our middle lower pane of glass was flimsy and loose in the frame (we were on the 10th floor). One stumble towards the window would be enough to send anyone plunging. In hindsight I should have complained, but I imagined all the rooms to be similar.
Overall I wouldn't stay again nor recommend this hotel to family or friends.",2.0,2
"ok but location
Arrived on Friday evening and this was my first time to Detroit. Valet parking ($25 per day with in and out privileges) and check-in was a breeze and as there was no one else there at the time. Was given a normal king-bed room on the 12th floor. The room was decent size but whilst it was clean, comfortable and modern, it didn't have the luxury touches that I would have expected to come with the Westin brand. Maybe they have different market positioning in the North America market as compared to Asia (where I have stayed at extensively). My only complaint was that it was not really walking distance to anything else, especially given the bad rep that Detroit has got for crime etc. I guess the neighbourhood felt particularly deserted on the weekend as many businesses were closed. It is of course not an issue if you have a car. 
One other issue that I have with this hotel is that the walls seem to be very thin. You can literally hear a conversation that is taking place in the corridor and in the next room. I was woken up twice at night by people talking whilst walking past my door down the corridor...",3.0,3
"Good hotel, great location
I stayed here on a recent business trip for the first time in several years. I was pleased that this remains a very good hotel. The location is on Times Square and could not be more conveniently located for business, theatre and restaurants. My room was spacious and nicely, if traditionally, outfitted. The air handling system is relatively quiet, there is a convenient and modern electronics dashboard for hooking up your laptop with the TV, etc. and the bed is very comfortable. It is especially nice that the duvet is of moderate loft and very usable. 
The downsides were severe problems signing onto the internet either using the ethernet cable or the hotel's wi-fi, and noise from the hallway. Soundproofing is good up & down and side-to-side, but every word spoken in the corridor comes through loud & clear. 
I didn't have a chance to try the lounge but appreciated the free access I was given at check-in, without asking.",4.0,4

1. Great location
2. Very clean

"Great location - clean room - great staff
My family and I stayed one night on a layover and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and helpful -- they even made arrangements to get us back to the airport in the morning. The location was fantastic -- only two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and a block from the Cable Car. We were able to pack in a meal at the wharf, a boat ride to the Golden Gate Bridge, a ride on a cable car and a visit to China Town topped off with Dim Sum before walking back (downhill all the way - yay) to the hotel. Even squeezed in a 4.0 earthquake in the morning. The room was clean, quiet and reasonably priced. What else could one ask for? If I had to make a tiny complaint -- they could improve the signage in the halls as there was some construction going on in the lobby that made some exits unpassable and made it a bit of a challenge to find our way out the first time. Otherwise, great hotel!",5.0,5
"It wouldn't be so horrible if only it was reasonably priced
This hotel is in a pretty location and the lobby is very nice, but the rooms are old and show their age. We stayed in a ""deluxe"" room with a view of marina. It didn't feel very ""deluxe"" to me. It was ok, just shabby, and a few things were broken, like the speakerphone by the bed and the drain stopper for the bathtub. We were in town for the AFC half-marathon and I wanted to take a cold bath after the race. Because the bathtub stopper didn't work, we had to stuff it with towels. And hardly any cold water would come out of the faucet, so my boyfriend kept re-filling the ice bucket with water from the sink! It was a little ghetto. 
The very tiny balcony had an old metal table a chairs with chipped paint. It didn't feel like the lap of luxury at all. 
This hotel was the official hotel of the AFC half-marathon, but you'd almost never know it (except that the race expo was there). The hotel concierge and employees were clueless about the procedure with busing from the hotel to the race start, which was disappointing. I left a message for the concierge asking about the busing procedure and, in response, a copy of the race FAQs was slipped under our door -- which did NOT answer the question I asked in my message. Fortunately, we were able to find the answer elsewhere. 
We didn't think the bed was comfortable. I woke up several times during the night and we both complained of backaches.
Self-parking at the hotel is $22 per day. Outrageous. And one of the parking areas is a dirt lot! That is really gouging people. 
We ordered room service one night. I had whole wheat penne pasta and prawns, which was ok. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich, which he said was really good.
Overall, I don't think I'd want to stay here again.",2.0,2
"Service Service Service!
W Boston does awesome living up to its Whatever Whenever reputation. The guest service is impeccable starting from the moment Jenny at the front desk who checked me in to Eric- the Acura driver who dropped us various places a few times. 
The decor is outstanding, with beautiful people to match. As far as the noise and sounds go..... well its downtown and yes there are clubs outside but with sound proofing seemed pretty good to me- would take the beautiful large windows and cityscape views over soundproof concrete. 
All in all - W boston is where I want to be!",5.0,5
"Don’t Bother Unless You’re Desperate
I made the huge mistake of booking through Hotwire looking for a 3.5 star and got this lousy, at best, 2 star hotel. I’m not really sure how this compares to a Hilton, however this is what was described on the site. The only good things about this hotel were the clean bathroom and the convenient location, otherwise BEWARE since you’re in for very loud and noisy window a/c units, crusty carpeting, holy blankets, peeling wallpaper, creaky beds, old (no flat) screen TVs, mismatched toiletries, no clock, and old granny furniture.

I like Embassy Suites. They have nice two-room suites and good service. This hotel was no exception. The Manager's Reception from 5:30 to 7:30 with free drinks is especially nice.

"Overpriced
Stayed at the Grove. Definately skeptical, but was told that it had new owners.
The positive: The bed and furnishing were good.
The negatives: Endless. I understand the new owners put some money into the property, but obvious was guided in the wrong directions. The workmanship was obviously done by amatures. My teenage kids could have done a better job. Should have gotten a general contractor. The bathroom needed extreme help. The sink stopper did not work. Toilet flush took forever. The hot water took a long time to warm up. Hair in the tub. Pee around the toilet bowl. Heater did not work.
I don't wish anyone to be terminated, but sometimes it needs to be done. The heavy set guy that works the late night should not be in the business. Terrible guest services. The lady that works the morning lacks confidence, but was nice. 
The rate of 79, was way too expensive the product and service I receive. Although the furnishing was nice, it is still a cheap motel.",1.0,1

"Where do I even start?
I'll try to keep this short as it would turn into a deluge of venom if I tried to express all that is wrong with this useless waste of prime real estate.
Here are my impressions after my wife and I stayed at this hotel in September 2012.
Customer Service: Upon entering the hotel to check it I was casually greeted by the two staff at the front desk. One was eating her lunch, taking photos of it and sharing them on Facebook via her cell phone. With food still in her mouth she asked how she could help us. He coworker remained reclined in his chair with his feet on the front desk as he, too, fiddled with his phone. During the check-in process there was a problem that could only apparently be fixed with the two staff yelling at each other in front of us. Very professional. Ten points for youthful rage and intensity. Zero for customer service.
Elevator: Jeez. Let's try this with only one word descriptions: smelly, rickety, old, run-down, smelly, smell-and-fresh (after someone sprinkled baking soda on the ground), terrible. I would have taken the stairs had they not been so narrow and had the guard rail not been unhinged and unsafe.
Room: Busted ceiling fan. Old, worn-out bed was the perfect nest for a crappy night's sleep. 
Bathroom: ""Skin friendly"" shower had two settings: drip, drip, driiiiip and holy-tortoise-crap-candy I have no more skin left. At least the water was warm.
Overall state of the hotel: dilapidated. The paint is chipped and the carpet is old, musty and coming undone in the hallways. The staff are unprofessional and rude. The area isn't the best, but then it's San Francisco where you always need your wits about you and where walking at night can be a bit sketchy. For example, there is a Walgreen's just down the street where hookers and pimps obstruct your way not only in, but also out. 
Price: $169 before taxes and fees. Had this hotel been $16.90 I would have still felt cheated. I stayed in two other hotels during my stay in The City, he Pickwick and he Opal hotels. I can't recommend the Pickwick enough and the Opal was fine, too.
Leave your valuables, pick up your kids and run as fast as you can, no, drive or fly as fast as you can away from this steaming pile of no-good, bad, nasty garbage.",1.0,1
"Old hotel, small rooms, great location
This is a large old hotel. Public areas are nice enough, one part was undergoing rennovations when we were there. Rooms are basic and small--decor is bland and some refurbishment is necessary, but it is clean and beds are comfy. Bathroom is very small and needs to be redone--some cracked and broken tiles, but clean. This is just a three star hotel--nothing more and okay for a night or two but do not expect luxury. Some of the staff are not great---not much of a welcome on check in and one of the concierges was very aloof and quite useless. When asked about a Thai art show my friend wanted to go to, he didn't find it ( I did, in a few seconds on the internet). When we asked about restaurants, no one bothered to book a reservation for us and we walked around for an hour trying to get in and ended up back at the hotel pub, which by the way, was very good. The other hotel restaurants were not very busy, which probably speaks for itself since others in the area were packed. Location is excellent, walking distance to shopping, restaurants, the Commons etc. 
Also, very annoying, there is a charge for internet in the room--I think $12/24hrs and in the business centre it is 50 cents a minute!!!! I thought it would be free. No WI-FI in the hotel at all.
We paid about $200 for the room, so value was not there in my view. It was busy with a major trade show and another convention in town.",3.0,3

Chose this because it was close to airport. Photo makes it look bigger than it is. Upon pulling into the parking lot....saw 2 guys that appeared to be ""conducting business"".

Staff was friendly. 
Plenty of parking underground. 
Agree with the comment about the rooster from below. 
Neighborhood isn't great. ""Women of the Night"" in front of several other establishments. We didn't go out after dark. 
Not impressed with the security......underground parking entrances to stairwells were not locked or room key controlled.......actually thy were but all the door latches were removed.

"It wasnt even cheap!!!
Avoid this hotel if you are staying in New York, its overpriced for what it is, the rooms are small, the hotel is literally a building site and so very noisy, the lifts only work half the time and you have to get a lift from your room to reception, then a further lift to the ground floor to get out if you have a stroller? The wait times at reception for check in and out are absolutely absurd. 
After arriving home I find we have been charged an extra days parking? despite picking the car up EXTRA EARLY (make sure you do this- you will wait at LEAST half hour in that reception line)

"Great location, helpful staff, free breakfast!
What more could you want!?
The Center city area of Philadelphia has 3 Marriott properties within 2 blocks of eachother, so prior to a recent business trip to the city, I was trying to figure out which one to book. Marriott's Residence Inn brand is definitely more functional rather than luxurious compared to the others, but it does the trick.
On arrival, I was greeted by the pleasant staff and informed that my Marriott rewards status made me eligible for a free upgrade (I was already staying on points). Minutes later I was relaxing in my 1 bedroom suite on the 21st floor overlooking city hall.
Little did I know that the best part was awaiting me the following morning with a quite impressive continental breakfast of waffles, eggs, sausage, melon, +++. Definitely more than I expected for a free hotel breakfast.
The hotel also has a very nice common area on the 2nd floor for those who want to get out of their room to do some work. Independence Hall is only a 10 minute walk away, while the Market line subway or Reading Terminal Market are both around the corner.
I'll definitely be staying here on future trips to Philadelphia.",4.0,4
"Beautiful rooms, great location, so-so service
My daughter and I spent one week at the Michelangelo earlier this month. She was working and I got a transit card and played tourist, visiting as many museums, sights and shows as I could. The location was ideal. The subway was very close and we could walk down to Dufy square to get half price tickets just before the show. By joining I prefer (free membership) before we arrived, we got free internet and a free room upgrade to a junior suite which was roomier and had a sitting area. The room was huge, although it still only had one bed. We were told we would have to pay $50 more to have 2 beds. The bed was very comfortable, furnishing were nice and the bathroom was large and sumptuous although it only had one sink. Once we had moved in, we were pretty much left alone, except that a maid knocked on the door at 9 am each morning, wanting to clean the room. That seemed very early to us. We thought rooms were cleaned laster in the day. Also, we were jet lagged, so still asleep at 9. The concierge was nice, but not terribly knowledgeable. As I was leaving, he told me it would be fine to take the subway to the airport on a Saturday, but it turned out the local line was closed, which was a hassle. The staff was friendly enough when approached, but we didn't feel in any way pampered. Breakfast, included with the room, was only served from 7-9 (you now know we are not early risers) and was very basic - choose from a pile of croissants or a pile of mini scones, help yourself to a cup or tea or coffee. So, if you are independent and are looking for a comfortable, quiet, attractive place in a great location, look no further. IF you want pampering, look elsewhere.",4.0,4
"Nice upgrade, but....
My colleague and I checked in for one night for a business trip. We checked in around 4pm and all of the double queen rooms were taken. The front desk was nice enough to upgrade us to a King suite. But the refrigerator is no work and all night the room smelled like smoke. It was obviously the room next door was smoking because the smell got stronger in the evening.",2.0,2
"Great Stay,Clean and Comfortable, Rooms, All rooms have great view

"Nice weekend
We came out from Phoenix and had a good weekend. Walked down to Sea Port village the first night for dinner. Then hit the heated pool before bed. Went to the beach in the morning then after clean up we walked across the bridge to catch a baseball game. Petco Field is a beautiful park. Kind of bugged me that there wasn't a easy way to get to Starbucks in the morning and had to go outside and around to get to it. Besides that I wouldn't pay that price for their breakfast and hate paying for parking anywhere, it was a nice weekend.",4.0,4
"Great hotel - fantastic location
Hotel room was fabulous - roomy and comfortable. Parking was a bit confusing and the catered meals we had for our training were the worst I have ever eaten, but I heard the food in the restaraunts was great. The elevators were very fast considering how many floors they serviced. Pool was great for end of day relaxing, with the hottub of course. Internet was slow and you get charged and reimbursed rather than it being truly complimentary. The shopping was amazing and we walked almost everywhere - perfectly located.",4.0,4
"It Served My Needs
I recently stayed here for a weekend. Although everything started out pretty good, it slowly declined the longer I stayed. The check in process was fine and the gentleman that helped me was very helpful. 
The room had a balcony, although it faced the very busy Pac Hwy so it was a little noisy. The hotel is located south of Sea Tac airport. It can be noisy at night with the airplane noisy but since I grew up near the airport it really didn't bother me. If you are a light sleeper, though, it might. There are some rooms that to me looked like they were in the basement (Room #10 - 34). If possible, I would stay away from these rooms. The pool is also in the basement.
When I stay at any hotel, no matter the star rating, I always check the towels to see if they are clean. When I checked the towels here, there were two towels with spots on them. I went down to the front desk and they were exchanged immediately. 
The next night, I came back to the hotel around midnight after having dinner and a movie with some friends. When I came back, very tired, neither one of my two key cards would work in the door. When I went down to have them redo my keys or give me new ones, I was met by a not so nice person. I was asked if I was told to keep my card away from my cell phone and credit card. I thought this to be very rude. At midnight, all I want is for my keys to be fixed, not met with a rude person at the desk. She did fix my keys but it was obvious she wasn't happy about it.
When I went to check out of the hotel, there were 2 employees helping the people that were checking in & out. One of them must have been new since a few times one person had to help the other quite a bit. I wouldn't mind this so much except for the fact that there were about 5 of us that needed help checking out and the person that was helping answered the phone so we were left with the (I'm assuming) new person so checkout was taking longer than normal. 
Although this hotel was adequate for my needs, I would only stay here again if I had an early or late flight and even then I would see if anything else would be available first.",3.0,3
"Meh
Everything at this hotel just misses the mark. 
Their website list square footage for each type of room, but they seem to very generous in their measurements. We checked into #39, which was supposed to be 200 sq ft, but I think 150 would have been closer to the mark (and I'd guess about 40 of that is bathroom). We ended up paying for an upgrade to #86 (even though it was on a smoking ""optional"" floor). #86 was listed at 300 sq. ft, but it felt like it was barely over 200.
Closet and drawer space very limited. Ended up with my suicase on the window sill.
Bathtub/shower was also really narrow. Nice toiletries, but no shower gel. Bathroom lighting too fluorescent/unnatural.
HVAC really noisy, so we turned it off most of the time (OK in spring, but wouldn't work in summer or winter).
Sound from the shower in the adjacent room also very loud.
Decor dark and gloomy.
On the plus side - service was pleasant, location it excellent. 
But I wouldn't stay here again - there are lots of better options in NYC.",2.0,2
"Wonderful location for a quick visit to Philly
Perfect location to see the sites and a short subway trip for a Phillies game. Short walk to museums and wonderful restaurants. Older building, well kept up.

Beds were none too comfy and the view of the building next door did not fullfill the extra awake time, However, if you came to see the city, I would recommend.",4.0,4
"Needs renovations
The people that run this hotel are very nice and very friendly. However the hotel needs renovation bad and is not up to Country Inn and Suites standards. The hotel is clean it just needs to be renovated. I tried to decide whether or not to give it 3 stars but it is too run down. The elevator is old and beat up and the carpets are worn. It is not in a particularly good area either. While convenient to Columbus the hotel is by some other rather seedy looking hotels and it is an older rundown area. Country Inn and Suites needs to renovate this hotel. I will say it was relatively inexpensive. I would not stay there again unless renovated.",2.0,2
"Exceptional Service

"great place for a convention
I was here May 2011 for a convention. My school stayed here so I think we got a good rate, it was all paid for by my university. It was nice staying here with the actual convention being inside the hotel, that made things easier. It is a GORGEOUS hotel and it is right by all the tourist things. There is a Starbucks in the basement of the hotel, which was nice to have so close! My only slight annoyance was that there was no WiFi, you had to plug your computer into the telephone cord to get Internet (and Internet at an expensive hotel is not cheap!). They said that they cannot have WiFi for the hotel because the building was too old to accommodate for it. Otherwise, one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in!",5.0,5
"Great stay at the Palomar!
Just got back from spending an extra night in Chicago. Was in town for business and also stayed at the Doubletree. Got a great deal at the last minute as I needed to stay one more night and the Doubletree was sold out. Thanks to the TA promotion online I got a King size bed in a great room for only $111! 
The Palomar has a great retro/modern vibe. A lot of use of lighting and contemporary features make it feel more spa like. Some of the pro's are that everyone working there was exceptionally courteous and friendly, eager to help in any way. Rooms felt more like a nice little apartment than a hotel. They also have a complimentary wine reception and although I didn't use the indoor pool and fitness center, they looked very clean and well maintained. It's not a place where you see a lot of families with little kids running around, it's more of an adult themed type of place (which I prefer). A nice touch is that the majority of lights in the room are on dimmers.
The only two con's I could think of are the lack of a coffee maker in the room, (but it is free down in the lobby in the morning) and the ridiculously small area to drive into when you first check in. It is literally big enough to hold only 2 cars, but the valets are always there to help get you in and out in a hurry. Beware, as parking anywhere overnight in Chicago is pricey, and the Palomar is getting $46 with in and out privileges.",5.0,5
"The Hilton is average
If you like small rooms at a high price with not a lot of amenities the Hilton is the place for you. Located near Dupont Circle and Embassy Row the hotel is centrally located but does not offer alot other than its location. I was there recently for a business seminar and felt that overall it was average. I expected more from a Hilton but found it to be average.",3.0,3
"Good place for a conference, cheaper food across the street
Stayed here for a weekend conference. Very nice, good facilities and very helpful staff.
I was very pleased with the bright, fresh feel of the room. It is not extra large, nor unusually small. I shared the room with a friend and we had enough space to be comfortable. Beds were comfy, and street noise was minimal.
Food choices were expensive - like $3.75 for a bagel, and $3 for an 12 ounce coffee. With tax I would be out about $8 for a bagel and coffee. Restaurant breakfast with tax and tip would have put me out $18 to $20, so I made do with coffee and waited for lunch - then went across the street to restaurants. 
There is block with restaurants on both sides, just at teh foot of the hotel entrance drive. McDonald's, Lebanese Teverna, three Italian places, Mexican, Chinese, a New York Market (?Deli), and a Sushi place that serves Thai and Japanese cuisine. I tried the Lebanese (OK) and the Sushi place (very good). I guess I still paid $15 to $18 for lunch, but felt I got a better deal by trying something different. 
The public spaces, lobby, lounge, etc are all great. There are plenty of public computers available for checking email, and two terminals reserved for printing boarding passes. Restrooms are spic and span and elegant. It was easy to get around. Elevators were more than adequate for moving us all to and from meetings.
I really appreciated the staff at the hotel. There were people assigned to be in the hallway near our function rooms - to help us find anything we needed. They were smiling, friendly and more than helpful. This made a real difference in my experience. Other staff who were more helpful than I expected were the hotel phone operator, the front desk staff, and security people.",4.0,4
"Average..Nice location, nice lobby, service was so mediocre
When I entered into the lobby, I thought wow what a nice hotel- palacial and European feeling but then when I got to the reception desk I was quite disappointed. The service was very mediocre like why was I bothering them. When I was checking out there was a line of 8 people, it moved relatively quickly but I was regretting not doing self checkout. The rooms are clean but a bit awkward. There arent towel racks where there should be. The shower doesnt have a shelf that holds all travel amenities. And most annoying of all, the lotion was half gone. I will try another place.",3.0,3
"Everything was PERFECT. Great hotel.
Where to begin!!
I stayed here for a week. Rooms are huge. Bed is huge. Views are great. I travel a lot for business and not too concerned about the rooms but this one was incredible. Request a corner room as high as you can go. The balcony is huge for a corner room. Bathrooms are large and the water is hot. Internet is very easy to use. The staff is fantastic. The gym is free and has lots of equipment. The pool area is clean and gardens are fantastic. You see a pattern here???
The bar staff downstairs was there for every need and kept the drinks full. Did I mention it's great location too?
When you go to Chicago just stay here. You won't be disappointed.",5.0,5
"A nice room with a beautiful view
The best thing about this hotel is the view of Boston and the harbour from the dining room and from your room if you are lucky enough to be on that side of the hotel. It is spectacular. The hotel is convenient to the airport but we didn't hear airport noise at all. 
We had dinner in the dining room and the food and service were both good, although it is pricey. What was really surprising though, and a bit off putting, was that the Hyatt still charges for wifi ($12.95 for 24 hours). And there is a little coffee maker in your room, but only enough coffee to make one cup. How chintzy and unbecoming for a hotel of this calibre. 
When I mentioned at the front desk how surprised I was about their charging for wifi, the person at the desk said they get a lot of complaints about that and cancelled the charge. So if the Hyatt hasn't changed their policy on this by the time you go, make your feelings known!",4.0,4
"Good Value for the Price
I think this hotel is a good value for the price. The rooms are adequate, the meals were tasty, and the staff is friendly. The location is strange; but the price makes up for that. The recommends to the hotel management I could make which wouldn't affect a raise in prices would be a window for opportunity for the housekeeping staff. It is acceptable as it is now; however, housekeeping could dig a little deeper and round the corners for a more polished look. Also, most items work; however, we did find that the exercise room was out of commission when we registered (this was fixed about a day later); the remote for the TV did not work (need new batteries??); and the toaster didn't really toast. I want to make sure that I communicate FOR THE PRICE, these are not deal breakers. The hotel could have a more polished look without redecorating or adding flat screen TVs with some simple adjustments. That said, I would still come back.",3.0,3
"If you do not get a big discount skip it!
I went to this hotel because I needed to be in the neighborhood early the next day. The room, with tax, cost over $600!. The ""rack rate"" was $700. Naively, I suppose, I expected a really cool room for the price. The room was extremely average, the devices in the room seemed cheaply built. One big shocker: they charged extra for Internet access in the room. I was astounded. 
The staff was consistently very nice. This was the only redeeming factor. 
I am used to staying in nice B&B's- for this price one could have done much better at a B&B.",2.0,2
"This place deserves ZERO stars!
The Hilton near Logan is not like any other Hilton I have ever seen. It seemed low-class. The check-in process was terrible. I had to wait for about 20 minutes while ""Hilton Honors"" guests kept showing up when I was ""next"" in line. They are allowed to continually cut in line while regular guests stand there waiting. I was first in line the entire time. It was NOTHING like First Class check-in at the airport where there are separate agents for us and other agents for the economy people. I will NEVER stay at the Hilton again. 
The restaurant was a low-class sports bar. They did not have a nice place for drinks. The menu at the restaurant was terrible and the food had no taste at all. It's a terrible place. It does not even compare to the Hilton Hotel that we have here in Osaka, Japan. This place is a dump.
It may seem nice to people who have no idea what a classy hotel is meant to be. It must cater to a certain type of person who would be satisfied with such terrible service.
The man who checked me in denied that I waited for as long as I did. My two friends with me confirmed that I had not been exaggerating the time. They kept saying, ""Aren't you first in line?!"" But then another couple would walk up to the other line. The 3 idiots at the desk should not have been there for only Hilton Honors guests. There should have been a better system.
Don't bother eating in the restaurant. Do not order room service from that terrible restaurant either. 35 dollars for 2 pieces of Boston Cream pie that tasted like plastic was a bit steep. We also got 2 bottles of water with that order. We did not even eat the cake. Too nasty.
Bad service, bad food and bad atmosphere.",1.0,1
"Great Loacation, Affordable, and New(ish)
This is a relatively new NYC hotel (opened Feb 2009) so everything from the lobby to the guest rooms, decor and furnishings, are quite modern, functional, & and high-quality throughout, as one would expect from the Hilton brand. Our King room, while far from large, was adequate for two adults. Though our room was on the 7th floor & directly overlooking 35 St., it was very quiet both day and night during out 2 night stay. While the modern beds allow for 'adjustable firmness' for each person, we found them to be extremely comfortable at their default setting. The in-room-safe, and requirement for key-card insertion to operate the elevators, provides for enhanced security for both person and property. Staff were very courteous and professional, from the front desk (quick, smooth check-in) , house-keeping (friendly, timely, and thorough), to the folks who checked (and subsequently retrieved) our luggage while we continued to explore the city after check-out. Great location near 6th ave makes it convenient to Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, Macy's, and a short walk to Broadway shows, Times Square, Empire State Building, and rest of mid-town. Major subway lines are nearby for heading to uptown & downtown neighborhoods. We did not have occasion to utilize hotel's food services (restaurant open mornings for breakfast $17.50 pp) or the small lobby bar which opens evenings until 11pm), but there is no shortage of close-by cafes, restaurants, and pubs which offer good food and value. Highly recommend this hotel, will stay again as long as it remains competitively priced for this hotel category.",4.0,4
"A place to place your head on a pillow for the night...
After a week+ in Jamaica, having to come back to Dallas for work before going home was an interesting diversion.
I love the lobby of this hotel, very nice, check in was quick and efficient after an midnight arrival. The towers were confusing and I opted for a refurbished room. I have to say even with the Sheraton's new decor, the carpet and room seemed old and drab. But this is business and the room is functional.
My biggest complement goes to the sports bar. I went in after midnight and begged for a meal, even though the kitchen was closed, they brought me a chicken caesar wrap with lots of chicken was wonderful. I am so thankful. 
The facilities for meetings and classes were good, the lunch buffet at the conference was great.",3.0,3

"Beware
Please be careful not leave anything laying around the room while cleaning maids are in there. I left a nine foot long, solid-white cord (charger for my laptop) laying out after my checkout. I realized I hadn't packed it and immediately called back to have it picked up. 
Apparently the room had already been cleaned and no cord was reported. And of course no one wanted to confess to taking something afterwards. Now I'm out $80, and the Manager would do nothing. It took two weeks and numerous messages before I caught her on the phone to discuss this.

"Amazing Hotel
The US Grant has served as a romantic getaway for my wife and I for several years. It has never disappointed!! It is one of the most Historic and Romantic places you will find in San Diego in addition to exceptional service, immaculate facilities and beautiful rooms. Not to mention close proximity to anything downtown, 5-10 min walk (or bike cab), 15-20 min to SD attractions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes quality. 
While there are plenty of dinning options downtown, and I've tried plenty, the Grant Grill is in its own special category. Alberto, the Grill manager, knows exactly what the restaurant experience should be and doesn't disappoint. Make sure you strike a conversation when he approaches your table and ask him to recommend one of the Grill's own coctail creations. You can spend your entire stay at the hotel if you so desire...as we did. 
The US Grant is absolutely amazing-without question!",5.0,5
"Very good, but expected more from this hotel.
I booked a one-bedroom suite for 2 nights at the Setai fifth avenue. I chose this hotel because it is branded as a five stars hotel, because of the flexible check-in and checkout times and finally because of the good reviews on this website. Unfortunately, even though there were positives during my stay at the Setai, it did not reach my expectations for many reasons.
I’ll start with the negatives.
First, they pretend on their website that the hotel has flexible check-in and checkout times. In the hotel’s guide inside my suite, it’s also clearly written that «there’s no check in and checkout times at the Setai» and that guests can request a late checkout for their date of departure. Unfortunately, this is not true. I booked this hotel for this reason because I was landing in New-York in early afternoon and leaving in the evening and I didn’t want to wait hours at the hotel bar to wait for check in. Well, that’s exactly what happened. I arrived at the hotel just before 1h00PM and they told me at the reception I had to wait until 2h30PM for my suite to be ready. No excuses, no upgrades. At 2h15, the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready. That was a nice touch, but I was expecting my room to be ready when I arrived. Same story for checking out. I asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout. They asked me what time, and when I said 6h00PM, they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was 2h00PM. That’s unacceptable from a hotel that clearly claims they have no check-in and checkout times.
The other negative is that I requested at the time of booking a high floor because I always like to have nice views when I book hotels. They gave me the 19th floor. I could say it is a high floor, but not in this case since their website says the hotel’s one bedroom suites are located between 18th and 27th floor. 
The third negative is the service in the room. For example, there was a lack in maid service. There were spots of dirt left after the daily maid service. Also, coffees and milks for the espresso machine were not refilled. So I had to call for a refill and it took more than half an hour to have someone come to my room even though they said someone was coming «right now». Same thing for the laundry service, the person at the phone said someone was already on her way to pick up my clothes but it took more than 15 minutes to have someone knock on my door. This same person asked me when I needed my clothes back and when I said for the next morning before 10h00AM, they replied «no problems they will be in your room before 10». They gave me back my clothes at 10h45AM without warning me they would arrive late.
These are some of the small details that, alone, are not that bad. But, put together, they leave a poor impression. It is unacceptable from a five star hotel who ask their clients more than 1300$/night to stay in the type of suite I had.
Now, the positives.
First, the in-room dining. Although expensive, everything from the presentation to the quality of the meal was perfect.
When I needed transportation to go downtown, I asked if the chauffeured Maserati was available and it was. What an experience! The driver, I forgot his name, knows how to ride this sport car. He will get you to your destination in a very short time and don't be afraid, he is a very good driver.
Also, despite the erratic service I already mentioned above, the staff is, for the majority, exceptionally friendly. They will always smile, say hello and, when they remember, they will greet you by your name. 
Concerning the accommodation, the one-bedroom suite I had was very nice. It was nicely decorated and very spacious. These suites are equipped with washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, oven, etc. It really feels like you are at home. Also, the TV in the bathroom is a nice touch. 
In conclusion, I would have given this hotel 3.5 stars. But since I can’t give a half star, I give the Setai 4 stars because that’s the number this hotel should have in reality. A 5 stars hotel is, in my opinion, close to perfection. Unfortunately, the Setai Fifth Avenue failed in many departments as stated above. It is still a very good hotel, but it costs too much for what you get in return.
For all these reasons, I do not think I will come back at this hotel. I’m ready to pay a lot a money for service but I expect to get what I pay for which was not the case at the Setai. For the same price, next time I’ll try the Trump International hotel or the Mandarin Oriental.",4.0,4
"The closest to Universal Studios
Our family recently returned from an overnight trip to Universal Studios for Halloween Horror Nights and we loved our stay at the Hilton. The walk to/from Universal was really easy (even at 2 am), the hotel was safe and clean and every single employee we came across was really nice and friendly and truly seemed to care that we were all happy and well taken care of. In total, we had three rooms but we all came in one vehicle and we were only charged for one vehicle. No issues with billing, check in and check out was a breeze (much appreciated since my husband and I were traveling with all teenagers). It was a flawlessly easy break with the kids thanks to the Hilton. Also, about an hour after we arrived, they brought us all (in all three rooms) bottled waters compliments of the hotel...very nice touch. The view from the hotel was amazing! The beds and pillows..so comfy! Great trip, you can't go wrong staying here.",5.0,5
"Average Stay
My partner and I stayed here during a visit to San Francisco for a sight seeing weekend, the hotel was OK, amenities good and a light breakfast is certainly what you get.
The bathroom was LARGE! With some good freebie toiletries on offer, I did however struggle to get a good temperature to come out of the shower, it's either too hot or too cold, once i'd worked that out it wasn't too bad.
I would stay here again as it was close to everything that we needed and we could walk about, the only worrying thing sometimes is to hear all the noise going on outside at night, shouting, swearing, etc, This can be a little off putting and also make you wonder about going out at night!",3.0,3
"Stay away!
I've never had a hotel experience ruin a trip before and I can't imagine a hotel being OK with a guest leaving with such terrible feelings. My husband and I traveled with my 93 year old father and we had 2 adjacent rooms so I was available for my dad if he needed me. The first morning my dad said that he had called the front desk the evening before and asked for a 7:30am wake up call, but the call came at 2am! This caused the first problem, that dad was too tired to do much during the day, felt exhausted and didn't enjoy much. The response from the front desk was, ""we apologize for the inconvenience"". The second night he again asked for the same wake up call but this time they called him at 6am. By the time that he got up, got dressed and looked at the clock, he realized that the call had been too early. He was so overtired that he became sick and we had to change our flights home to leave right away instead of stay for the rest of our trip. It wasn't just that he was extremely exhausted, but that he was so miserable and felt terribly ill from the exhaustion. The manager actually argued with me when I said that I wanted my money back for my father's room. I was just credited for 2 nights which doesn't come close to making up for the misery. My dad is still feeling sick.
Also, other bad things about this hotel: It advertises the roof garden for the guests, but actually it is continually rented out for private parties so forget that. We nearly walked down the isle with a bridal party when we tried to go out into the garden.
The plumbing (I see that others have taken note) is unreliable. I couldn't fill a bathtub to take a bath at 11pm at night because the water from the faucet was such a tiny trickle.
And I'm exhausted from not sleeping because of the nearly constant sirens going off on the streets during the night. You can do much better for your dollar by staying almost anywhere else.",1.0,1

"Great Location & Hotel - Dusty Room
I visited the Belvedere over Easter this year. Location is excellent, less than 5 minutes walk from Times Square. The breakfast coice was fantastic, ranging from a cooked hot breakfast to fresh fruit meat and cheese buffet. Door and Restaurant Staff were fantastic as well. However, our daughter was ill and vomited 5 of the six nights that we were there. We requested clean sheets a few of the nights and the staff confrimed this would be done. In the end the sheets never arrived or wqere not changed. We chased a few times and still not changed. After complaining a third time the sheets arrived, but we had to put these on ourselves. This spoilt our trip somewhat, as did the 1 to 2 cm of dust / dirt / other peoples waste that we found under both of the beds. On the second day we advised the hotel staff that the room was not clean but I guess they can't be bothered to vacuum UNDER the beds....
Shame really as this could have been an excellent review but severely let down by the cleanliness of the room",3.0,3
"DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR FAMILYS SAFETY!
The hotel staff gave out keys to another person to view our room while we were in it. After this episode frightened my children and upset my husband and myself, the hotel staff refused to do anything to appease the situation. Upopn checkout they even charged full price for the stay. After weeks of us having to ""chase"" the management, they finally issued a credit of $50 which was not even equal to one's nights stay. There mistake ruined our family vacation, due to very tired children who were afraid to sleep the next days events were a disaster. We booked 3 nights total, a credit of at least the one nights stay would have been fair upon checkout. If you value your peace of mind and your familys safety - DO NOT STAY HERE!",1.0,1
"Grand Exterior, Fancy Lobby, Ordinary Rooms and Snotty Service
I got a great deal for a bridge/city view room for a last minute stay in SF ($176/night on Hotels.com). That alone made it worthwhile. The Fairmont has never done me wrong, so I decided to run with it. The hotel is extremely old world elegant, which isn't really my thing. I prefer sleek and contemporary to gilded and gaudy, but it does come off as high end, if not a bit pretentious and stuffy. 
The room was okay - decent size, comfortable bed, nice view and an adequate (though undersized) bathroom. In general, the room was just average. EVERYthing related to the room comes at an extra charge, and I mean everything. Wi-Fi, parking, coffee, even bottled water was egregiously priced at $7. It's clear they try to get you in the door and then take advantage of the fact that you will spend extra money just out of convenience. Lame. 
But what really ticked me off was what happened after I returned to the hotel with my friends. We had been out having some drinks and decided to go to the hotel bar for a nightcap. Well, the bar was closed (early) so we thought maybe we'll just order wine and some snacks from room service and proceeded to the elevator. Just then, hotel security approached me and cross-examined me about the nature of my business in the hotel. Right in the middle of the public lobby. When I explained I was a guest, they asked me to show my room key to prove it. Really? Totally insulting. 
Finally, after I checked out, I left my bags with the porter while I roamed around the city before my flight. When I returned to collect my bag, they couldn't find it, despite the fact that I had the claim check they gave me. It got so silly that they invited me into the checked bag area to ""see if I could find it."" Were they going to just let me take any one I chose? Fortunately, I found my bag and as I was walking out, there was another woman coming in to look for HER bag that they couldn't find. Clearly, my experience wasn't isolated. 5 star service? I think not.",3.0,3
"Good for McCormick Place
I was attending a trade show at McCormick Place on my own dime. After reading countless reviews, my husband picked this place. 
A friend in the same industry and I had dinner, he dropped me off and he was a little leery of the location. There are lots of condos for sale in the neighborhood, its just ideally located, buit it is a neighborhood in transition. Check in was ok, not the most efficient as there were at least 4 other people trying to check in. My room was pretty big, on the 5th floor, at the end of the hall facing the busy subway stop. Some nice big windows and 2 beds. 
Yes, the beds were hard, but I like hard beds. If you don't like hard beds, this place may not be the place for you. Bath tub was very deep and there was always a fan blowing in the bathroom. No fancy shampoos here... just a wall mount shampoo and body wash fixture. Shower head sprayed everywhere, not necessarily on me. Not the best water pressure either. There was a fridge too. 
After walking a trade show all day, I was exhausted and crashed and woke up on and off all night with the trains. 
After reading the reviews, I skipped breakfast at the hotel for an overpriced coffee and coffee cake at McCormick Place. 
There were not a lot of cabs, and there was a man who was waiting for a while before I got out there, and after a few more minutes, I went back inside and the staff was calling for cabs. One staffer actually went out to another block to wave down a cab for us. 
Shared a cab with others going to McCormick was only $7. So worth the $$ since I knew I would be walking my feet off all day. Could I have walked, yes, but with luggage and all, wasn't gonna happen. 
There was a number of people from the trade show at this hotel. It was priced reasonably enough for those who don't have a huge expense accounts. 
Will I stay here again? Depending on the trade show schedule and what hotel rates are going for, its 70% likely.",3.0,3
"Nice and serviceable
This is a hotel like many in the city that are renovated apartments, so it has charm. Its rooms were ok, but the bathroom was very small and cramped, and though I do not usually worry about this, it was quite noticeable. There is a nifty buffet breakfast laid out on each floor. There was a good variety of pastries and fruit and juice and coffee. I liked the hotel, and would stay again, but would not particularly seek it out.",4.0,4
"Functional, but not spiffy!
A few months ago, I reviewed a hotel near Princeton that had this strange, sort of sterile (but not in a clean sort of way) institutional sense about it. I would have to say, this property had many of those same traits.
It wasn't bad. Nor was it dirty. It just wasn't spiffy. In fact, it sort of felt like a ... University hotel! The best decision we made was to upgrade by $20 for the club level (or whatever they call it,) which meant we got a VERY nice continental breakfast for the cost of a tip. Eggs, cereal, fruit, Starbucks coffee. We left feeling very satiated, and the desk staff was certainly kind and helpful.
Weird, but safe neighborhood. (Near University of Pennsylvania, with some trendy neighborhoods nearby, but you're not quite actually IN one.) Would stay again if the price were right.",3.0,3
"Oasis of quiet calm in the bustling city
We were recently married on Cape Cod and doing the more old-fashioned get-away after the reception. Having decided to fly out to Bermuda the day after the wedding, we knew we wanted to stay in Boston so as to have easy access to the airport. Rather than opt for a hotel full of tourists and other weddings, I thought XV Beacon might be just the calm & quiet we wanted to reconnect after a busy 48 hours of wedding fun. 
From the moment we arrived, we knew we had made the perfect decision. Our car was unloaded with smiles & welcomes. The service at the front desk was flawless. The bellman knew the history of the building (impressing my very history-oriented new husband) and showed us every feature of our room to make sure we knew how everything worked. 
White rose petals decorated the floor & bed....something I had only seen in movies and which brought us as much joy as the plate of chocolate covered strawberries contragulating us on our marriage. 
We took advantage of the beautiful views from the roof deck before ordering room service -- which included a fantastic bottle of bubbly from the full wine list of Mooo - the best burger in town - tuna appetizer - and the chicken club. Hey, I know we had the best menu in town to order from, but honestly - we were hungry and it was fantastic! I recommend the burger to EVERYONE! The best part, with the delivery, was that they took care to not muss up the rose petals and one staff member even re-arranged it when he knocked a petal out of place. Just shows the level of attention to detail. 
Our wake up call was prompt, the coffee was hot, and the driver to the airport was fantastic. The culmination of an all-too-quick, but fantastic stay.
I have recommended XV Beacon before and know my husband joins me. It is actually the perfect spot in Boston if you need one night away and are willing to splurge. It is worth every single penny to be treated with such gracious respect. 
Thank you to all the staff. We will be back!",5.0,5
"Solid location to base your Austin stay
I was in Austin for 3 nights, 4 days for business at the University. There were a lot of hotels booked, so honestly this wasn't my first choice, but it worked out real well.
It lived up to Hyatt Regency standards, with quality room, comfortable bed (the TV HD quality could be better). I had a business package special that included breakfast buffet each morning, a shirt laundered each day, free internet, free bottle of water. It was really a good deal, especially the shirt pressing...it was sweet.
The location isn't the greatest if you want to enjoy downtown. You either have to walk across the 1st street or Congress bridge. Maybe a 15 - 20 minute walk depending on where you're going.
The Hyatt workout room lived up to its good standards with cool towels, lots of machines. It is also right next to a great trail and there are tons of people on it.",4.0,4
"Way more ""Motel"" than ""Hotel"".
Adequate. Period. Apparently was an attempt at a condo complex that wasn't making it--so trying to call itself a ""hotel"". Claims to be near downtown and near UT Campus....HA!! It's 7+1/2 miles from Campus, and the drive takes a minimum of 16 minutes. The rooms are not bad, but the door/key is very difficult to manipulate. It's setup like a little studio apartment; kitchen, sitting room, separate bedroom/king-sized bed, with a vanity and toilet-shower. The sitting room has a decent sofa---but NOT a sofa bed. In fact, they have No Rollaways available. Breakfast is do-it-yourself packaged oatmeal, smallish muffins, and dried cold cereal. Absolutely Horrible coffee. No skim milk. Apples and bananas. Nothing else fresh, nothing cooked-to-order. NOT a ""bed-and-breakfast"". Advantages--cheap, easy to park, quiet neighborhood, friendly ladies at the front desk. Disadvantages--Not close to Anything, needs a lot of remodeling, terrible excuse for a breakfast. Definitely NOT a ""three-star""; Basically: you get what you pay for.",2.0,2
"A really bad hotel
Please do not stay in this hotel under any circumstances. I arrived today at 5:00 p.m. and my room wasn't ready. I was finally admitted after standing in a long line by about 6:30 p.m. My room is tiny and grimy. There is no air, and the windows don't open. I can't turn the TV on. The technician was just here to fix the AC and he had to leave to find a part. It has been 20 minutes, my room is torn apart from where the technician was working, and it's 10 p.m. The front desk man said, ""so sorry, my pleasure,"" when I called. In other words, these people are clueless. Do not stay here. It ranks among the worst hotels I've ever experienced, and i am a big traveler.",1.0,1

Do not even attempt to park an SUV in their garage. They won't tell you but their garage is not meant for SUV's. The Manager on duty herself has damaged her car 3 times. 4 other employees told me that people damage their cars all the time. You have to do a 5 point turn just to make it around the corner and up/down the ramps. All the employees that I met with stated that people with SUV's should not use their garage. They only told me that after the fact when they should warn their guests ahead of time and give them the option in taking the risk.",1.0,1
"The Worst
I travel allot for my job and I'm in and stay in hotels all around the world. I recently stayed here on business, booked through Priceline which I normally trust in respect to star rating, not this time. This hotel is one of the nastiest places I've visited in my memory. The desk attendant was no where to be found on my 5pm arrival. Once I was able to find him he seemed confused by my prepaid reservation and attempted to charge me again. The hallways and common areas where depressing and worn and stale smelling. My room smelled terrible, had holes in the walls, nasty carpet and the bed spreads had burn holes. I sat on my bed and it collapsed under me. The bed platform was broken and a board popped out like a projectile when I sat on the bed. There was a note on the table saying that the water would be off that evening for plumbing repairs. The next morning after a bad nights sleep due to the awful smell of the place I was thrilled at the prospect of leaving when I discovered I had no hot water in my shower. There actually was scalding hot water if you adjusted the control but only a trickle. The shower curtain bar was barely hanging from a small nail on either end and linked as if the whole thing would come down if it was touched. I managed to get somewhat cleaned up with what I had to work with, kinda like camping, and proceeded to check out where I was unable to find a desk clerk to complain to. I looked at the breakfast buffet where a lady was pouring a bag of preboiled peeled eggs from a plactic bag which had a strange white gooey liquid in it, into the serving tray. I managed to hold back my nausea and escaped. Priceline rated this hotel 2 1/2 stars which is normally a Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn category. I really dont know what this category should be in but I sure don't want to stay in anything like that again. I think this is what it must be like to live in a homeless shelter. Those poof people should have it better. I will prey for them.",1.0,1

"MarQueen Mistake
Our stay at the Marqueen Hotel was depressing and it was kind of our fault.  We had a wedding in Seattle and were looking forward to some city time.  Some family members booked at the Marriott.  Then a niece said she booked the Marqueen as it was cheaper and had free parking.  So, everyone changed reservations. 
If you arrive at this hotel by car, be advised it is on a busy one-way street.  There is valet parking only with two spots out front to leave your car.  You are allowed to return to your car escorted by the valet.
On arrival in the musty smelling lobby, we were told by the very snippy desk clerk that the hotel did not offer free parking but we could self park three blocks away.  She acted like we were trying to cheat her but it was our mistake and the web site says 'fee charged'.  Then she says our room is on the second floor, up the stairs.  They have no elevator.  (Not on the website)  This was OK for us but in our group we have a heart patient and an arthritic.  I mentioned this to the clerk.  She took it to mean we were refusing the second floor and would put us on the first floor with our group.  We  later found out everyone else was on the second floor.
At this point, I would have changed hotels were we alone.  Because everyone was there, we stayed.
The room was strange.  It was dark with a very small bathroom with no bathroom fan; odd little kitchen with a large fridge, a microwave, dishes but no cooking utensils; poor TV; a scary closet; and a view of a muraled brick wall 4 feet away.  The bed was OK but not good enough to make up for the rest.  You could have clean towels if you left your towels on the floor but clean sheets were not an option.
The location of the hotel is good considering Seattle's good bus system. Breakfast was Super 8ish with good coffee (it is Seattle). There was no place for a group of six people to congregate.
It was depressing to be stuck here for three nights of my vacation but we were with our family and made the best of it.  I just would like to help save someone else's trip.",2.0,2
"meh....
Ive had better for less. Front desk didnt speak english and seemed confused by EVERYTHING. We had no electricity in our room for the first hour. After calling the front desk and explaining more than the non existent alarm clock was an issue we had to walk down to get it resolved. VERY small property. Clean. We opened our blinds to look literally onto peoples roofs. the neighborhood looks sketchy but seemed surprisingly safe. Its a full 15-20 walk to alamo/riverwalk. Id spend the extra $9 and stay at the red roof inn.... (better location and experience)",3.0,3
"Crowded...but still very nice...
We happened to stay on a Saturday and I couldn't believe how crowded the parking lot was when we arrived. Apparently, there was a soccer tournament in town and some weekend meetings going on in the conference rooms. It had very little effect on our stay, though.
The bed was very comfortable...probably one of the most comfortable I've slept in at a hotel. The employees were very nice and helpful. Check-in went quickly and we had no problems with our room. My biggest complaint was that there were no towels at the pool. I know that it was crowded on and off all day, but I think there should have been someone who was responsible for making sure that the towel supply didn't get completely depleted. I saw employees walk by outside of the enclosed pool area many times, but apparently they had other jobs they were doing. There was a fire pit by the outside pool area which was very nice. We also used the indoor hot tub, but it had a green tint to it, so I had some concern about how clean it was. 
The hotel provided breakfast, lunch, dessert and snacks for the event we were attending. I was pleased with the food that was provided.
Overall, it was a good stay.",4.0,4
"Disappointed.
I was very excited to stay at the newly renovated hotel. The physical layout was very minimalist. It certainly had eye appeal. Unfortunately that was the only redeeming factor of this boutique hotel. The staff all seemed to be very young and unexperienced . Their attempts to rectify problems were poor. I made it clear that i would only being staying 3 nights when I checked in and upon check out, yet I was charged for 4 night. I called daily to complain of the empty lotion/soap dispensers. They were of wonderful quality but I never got to try any. Many little things just kept adding up. Definitely NOT worth the price when there are so many other choices in the area.",2.0,2
"DO NOT STAY HERE, MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE!!!!
Stayed there for 2 nights from 9/18-9/20.

I checked out yesterday and the hold is still on my account and no one can tell me when I can get the hold released and the money back in my account. I was stranded without any money on my trip and now I am back home and still do NOT have access to my own money. The incompetant hotel staff and management are doing nothing to help me out.

It had a mini bar - very expensive so we didn't use it but it was well stocked with a variety of snacks and beverages. The staff was amazing upon check in and check out.

"Nice Weekend Stay
I stayed at this hotel from 7/6-7/8 with my significant and I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was compared to previous reviews of others that stayed here. Our check-in was rather quick and our room was ready and clean. The housekeeping service was great and she came to check to see if we needed anything as well as obliged us with extra wash cloths and towels when requested. My only complaint is that during our second night there was a lot of noise from one of the groups that were staying in the hotel. I would suggest to the hotel that they reconsider allowing large groups (i.e. sport teams) to stay there as it messes with the ambiance of hotel due to the immaturity of the groups. The purpose of my stay was to relax with my boyfriend to celebrate our 1 year and it was interrupted by noise :( The location of the hotel is great and all of the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly. The elevators are a little slow but if you're not in a hurry, then it's not a big deal.

The bonus about this hotel is that Target, Chipotle, Potbelly, Pei Wei, Friday’s, and a few other stores, banks, and eateries are within walking distance. This hotel is about 10-15minutes from downtown Philadelphia.

We were here for two nights and enjoyed a comfortable stay. The staff was very friendly from the valets to the front desk to housekeeping. The hotel is decorated in a very modern, sleek, European style and the common areas are fresh, new and sparkling clean. The room itself felt a bit smaller than other hotels I've experienced in this chain but boasts all the features that make me love Springhills, like a large desk, sitting area with a couch, microwave and fridge. The refrigerator and microwave are perfect for those times when you order room service and would love to save the leftovers for a second day reheat. Breakfast in the morning was good, with a wide variety of options and coffee and tea are available all day in the lobby. Offering ""room service"" delivery from the TGI Friday's downstairs is a great touch, and an option that we enjoyed when we arrived exhausted after a long day of driving. The location of the hotel is fantastic, close to IUPUI, Lucas Oil Stadium and the zoo and our room had a lovely view of the White River State Park.

"Great Location for Business of Pleasure
I stayed two nights at the Hyatt for a lobbying effort with medical students. About 1000 medical students were in attendance and most packed rooms in this hotel. The Hyatt staff were very attentive. Check in was efficient, and the rooms were excellent. Beds were nice, room was clean, and bathrooms were spacious. Wireless internet worked well. It stated that there was a $16.99 per day charge for internet, but they did not include this on my bill (I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, so this may be free with that). The upside of this hotel is its location - literally two blocks away from the U.S. Capitol. After holding a meeting with over 1000 participants in the Hyatt Conference room (good breakfast provided and AV equipment worked without a hitch), we all headed over to lobby congress on medical issues. The proximity of the hotel to the Capitol and legislative buildings made the trip worthwhile. It is also only 3 blocks from Union station so it was easy to take the subway back and forth from Reagan International Airport. There is a nice bar and restaurant in the lobby, although I didn't eat there - these were nice places to gather. 
The downside of this hotel was the noise. I could hear the people talking in the rooms on either side of me and I could hear the elevator 'binging' every time it opened on the floor. I'm glad I had earplugs with me. 
This is an expensive hotel with a great location and really good service. The noise prevented me from giving it five stars, but I would still highly recommend it.",4.0,4
"This is the place to stay when vacationing in NY
First off, the check in process was easy; stress free and Natalie at reception really help us a lot. The Room was spacious enough and really comfortable.

The bed was so incredible that we asked the manager the brand of the matress to buy one for my house. The Room and the Bathroom was perfectly clean .The location is really convenient because you are 1 minute walking from Time Square in a street that doesn’t have the crowded sidewalks of Time Square itself. The Concierge services were excellent and sell us all the attraction tickets at the best prices. The check out was automatic and we didn’t need to do nothing about it , they hold our bags for us to walk around Time Square until departure time.

Lovely hotel within walking distance to the Harbor, although I am surprised to see the Hotel labeling itself as ""Inner Harbor.""

As with most older hotels, the bathrooms are refurbished except for the tub/shower and tile around the tub. I'm not sure why hotels do this, but it certainly dates the wear on the hotel.

"A Quiet Place to Sleep in NYC
My husband, our 8-year-old, our 5-year-old, and I stayed at the Salisbury Hotel recently for a 4-day mini-vacation. We found cheaper hotels online, but I was concerned about some of the reviews, so we thought we'd spend a little more. I'm glad we did! We arrived right on time for check in, and a room was ready for us. However, the woman at the front desk said we could have a room with a pantry if we were willing to wait a half hour or so for it to be cleaned. We were willing, so the kids and I sat in the lobby while my husband parked the car. A short time later, we made it to our room on the 17th floor (the top floor). The view isn't great, as most of the other buildings are taller, but the kids enjoyed watching the construction at the building across the street. The room isn't fancy (the hotel is pretty old), but everything was clean and pleasant and met our expectations. Some of the lamps weren't plugged in and seemed to be in need of new light bulbs, but we didn't care enough to trouble the staff. We were there to see NYC and spent very little time at the hotel. Our room was very quiet (we heard the construction when we got up, but it didn't wake us). We left the room before breakfast and didn't return until after dinner. The only real concern we had with the room was that the window locks were broken and, at 17 stories up, that made us a little nervous. The kids were told to not open the windows and, as my husband and I were always in the room and the kids were never unsupervised, I wasn't too worried about it. If we had planned to spend more time in the room, we may have requested a change. However, the hotel was booked, so I don't know if that would have been possible. Perhaps if you have small children, you may want to think twice about staying in that particular room. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. The bell hop who brought up our luggage even noticed that we had only three sets of towels and immediately fetched a fourth set. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but instead bought bagels, fruit, etc., at the nearby Cafe Metro. The hotel is in a quieter part of the city and very close to Central Park. We also enjoyed the pizza at nearby Angelo's. We are pretty low maintenance, and require only quiet, clean, and comfy, and the Salisbury Hotel was perfect for us. We would stay here again on our next trip to NYC.",4.0,4
"Bad Experience A-Z
I was placed at the Microtel by United Airlines due to the plane being off schedule. After landing and getting the luggage, went to the appropriate area to be picked up. Very cold, so I call to make sure shuttle was running since it is 11pm. They said yes, and I informed them that there was an entire (small) plane of people waiting to be picked up and she just said ""I know, they'll be there when they can."" I take a cab, thank goodness. The van (8 person) arrived 15 minutes after me. Cabs followed with more passengers unwilling to wait. Get to my room and it is the nastiest room, curtains stained with holes and top unhooked and hanging down, carpet stained and dirty, screen from window leaning against wall. The worst part was finding bugs in the bed. There were two beds, so I stripped down the second bed and didn't see anything, so finally got to sleep very late. Had scheduled the shuttle for the next morning at 9:15. I was in lobby at 8:45, and the desk person told me that if my appointment was for 9:15 I had to get on the 8:45 bus because their schedule was off and I wouldn't get out at 9:15. Good thing I was in the lobby 30 minutes early, or I would have been late! I took the van, with the heater blowing 180 degrees the whole way. Never, ever again. I took pictures so that United Airlines could see where they were putting their customers that had to be inconvenienced due to the airline errors.

They apologized profusely and said Security would be right up--less than five minutes. Nothing happened. We laughed it off, went for a swim, had a couple drinks, and then called a fourth time--now 2 1/2 hours after check-in. The Desk Manager was grovelingly apologetic and said he would handle it personally. Nobody EVER showed up!!!

"Ok location but poor service/experience
We chose Inn at El Gaucho because we wanted to stay near downtown but avoid some of the larger hotels. The location is great because of its walking distance to downtown attractions. It is a smaller ""boutique"" hotel so the rooms are fairly small and a bit dark for our taste. As mentioned there is a set of stairs to climb to get to the hotel but that wasn't an issues. We also did not experience noise issues mentioned by few other reviewers. The big problem we had was that when we arrived at the hotel they didn't have rooms with two queen beds. I specifically did not book online and called by phone their booking agent in order to ensure I get such room. They assured me I will get it. Once there such room wasn't available and we paid extra for an additional person. When I asked them to remedy the situation by giving me an additional room they were not willing to do it. They also stated that they experience this issue all the time. I told them that they should bring it up with their booking agent or stop using that booking agent but they said that they cannot survive without the booking agent (Expedia.com and Hotels.com). Anyway, very poor service overall. One additional problem we experienced is the smell of the kitchen below (not a good food smell but just smell of a commercial kitchen).",2.0,2

Junior, Edward and Mana kept a close look-out for our driver arriving from Boston and offered their help in guiding him to the hotel. Overall the was my best hurricane ever and although there were some bumps, our trip to New York was made great due to the kindness and service of your wonderful staff. We will continue to return to the Crowne Plaza each and every trip to New York.",5.0,5
"Nasty Marriott
Below average liquor choices, food that is below average even for a Hampton Suites, in the consigers lounge. The bathroom had corrosion around the shower stall. The shower head placement forced me to hug the wall. Rooms also need a facelift, old smelly carpets everywhere. If the client was not paying for this room I would NOT stay there. Compared to other Marriotts in the area this facility is a loser.",2.0,2
"Pretty nice, but not spectacular for the star rating
This hotel is enormous. Beware if you hate to walk, because it took us a while walking just to get to our room. There are two separate towers, and so we had to cross a walkway every time we came and went. The place is busy, people everywhere, several restaurants to choose from, but none that we ate at because we were on a budget. I bid for a hotel on Priceline and got this one for a ridiculously cheap price. The room was okay. It was handicap accessible and the roll in shower was nice and spacious. The bathroom was clean. The bed was a little soft to be honest, but I didn't mind it. The TV was old and didn't work that well. The cable faded in and out when it stormed. The view was great, looked out on Navy Pier. The wallpaper was peeling a bit. The hotel is a short distance from all the sights. The only true complaint is that we had a ""Do Not Disturb"" tag on our door (we were sleeping in) and there was a loud knock on the door at 7:30 AM on a Sunday. They knocked twice loudly and then attempted to open the door, but we had the extra lock secured. We called down and requested that they do not knock again the next day, and that we wouldn't need the room serviced, but just to have them drop off some towels and shampoo. They didn't knock again the next day luckily. Overall this is a nice hotel, but I would never have paid more than what I did on Priceline. It's nothing special.",3.0,3
"Pillows and valet parking
We just came back from Philadelphia and we are very disappointed with the valet parking. We have a lexus that was never smoked in. After getting in our car in smelled from smoking and the person even put our air conditioner on to try to get rid of it. I called the Sheraton and told of our problem which was suppose to be brought to the GM's attention. I received a call from the valet parking and he said when did you notice the smell, ask what the valet person looked like and said he would address it. End of conversation. The GM never bottered to call me back and I think our parking should of been refunded if nothing else. I also complained about the pillows but received no response,Also the bed pillows were worthless.",2.0,2
"There are much better options nearby
Stayed here for a conference, but wouldn't stay again. The Palomar is about 2 miles closer to the city (along the expressway) and is a MUCH nicer hotel and costs less than the Doubletree. Even if Palomar cost more, I would choose the Palomar every time.
The Doubletree is shabby (as others have pointed out), smelly (what is that smell anyway?) and in desperate need of renovation.
As a plus, the staff was very friendly and helpful. 2.5 stars.",3.0,3
"Worst hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dont reserve a room at this hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet or if you want to sleep at all!! Reserved a night at this hotel on the basis of my experience with another Hilton Garden Inn hotel. THiS HOTEL WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!! They had an indoor pool with the hotel rooms surrounding them. There was loud noise at the pool until 10pm. There was an extreme amount of kids with no supervision, Once the pool closed they all migrated to the room next to me were extremely loud & the kids started opening the door & screaming across the hotel to kids in other rooms! I went and complained to the front desk & asked for another room & was told that the hotel was booked & not offered any other solution (it was not even mentioned that they would try to quiet the kids)! We left the hotel at Midnight to try and find another hotel!",1.0,1
"Great location
We stayed here August 2012 forfour nights - we did have to move rooms first night and get security up at 230 am as a VERY drunk American was kicking the next door to ours and shouting . The rooms were quite large beds comfortable and typical conservative US style furniture and bathroom . 
Only disappointment was that wifi was chargeable at about $ 15 a session which atthis hotels prices issimply wrong - I mean how can they charge you for wifi these dayswhen its free in diners and MacDonalds ?",4.0,4
"Millionaires view
Just had a short weekend break in New York and stayed at this hotel. We had a junior suite which occupyed a corner location, this gave a fantastic panoramic view of the Hudson along with some of the iconic landmarks in the city. We overlooked ground zero which is a building site but also very poinient and serene at the same time. The 2 water features are now in place in the original footprints of the twin towers and look amazing when light at night. Its hard to visulize the finished product at the moment but no doubt it will be spectacular. You could just lay in bed a survey the skyline if you wished. The room was nicely furnished and had a seprated area to work or relax if you wanted. Coffee facilities are available but for tea you have to ring room service for hot water.
The bar area was often busy so we only had a cuppa on the last day, for me Charles the concierge was the outstanding staff member, nothing was too much trouble for him, always pleased to help, someone even rang down to ask him the temperature outside!!!!! and gave the information with good grace. His knowledge of the city and its transport links were great as this hotel for all its views is at the bottom of Manhatten. We were able to make great use of the subway system which is on the corner and as WTC ( world trade centre) is the last stop you cant go wrong! As we were unsure of how the day would turn out we just purchased single trips form the machine at $2.50 at time. If you were staying longer then a a 5 day pass would be better!
We went for christmas shopping and I have to recommend a trip to 5th Avenue, when dusk starts the lights come on and its truly magical. However as we were there for the start of the holiday season we felt a significant increase in people every where from the saturday which made some of the stores unbearable and Times Square almost unwalkable.
So the hotel is lovely but you are out on a limb so depending on what you want to do, as to the location suiting you. There was not much around on an evening, with a cluster of bars and resturaunts about 10mins walk. Just ask Charles!",4.0,4
"Worst I have ever stayed in, hands down
I've stayed in hotels and motels all over the world, and I've stayed in some pretty ratty ones. Nothing like this one, though. It's surprising it's considered by code enforcement officials to be habitable. Filthy carpets, water damaged bathroom, small dirty hallways, and an array of unsavory guests, a couple of whom fought in the hallway late into the night. I had a pillow that smelled so bad I couldn't use it. Everything, walls, linens, carpets, mattresses, worn and stained. We lost our reservation at another motel, and picked this one out of desperation. The only positive thing I can say is at least our truck wasn't broken into. I can't guarantee that for you however, there was lots of shady activity in the parking lot likely including some prostitution. Seriously, and I can't say this with enough emphasis, do not stay here. You're better sleeping in your car.",1.0,1
"Horrible customer service
Stayed for a weekend, sprinklers had gone off and flooded the property, so no internet was available, and was told on check in that no room changes would be possible, since computers were down. No apology. Room was okay, but smelly, and dishes in the cabinet were dirty. Upon check out, told checkout was noon, service knocked at 9, 10, and 11 to ask why we were checking out ""late"". When I asked at the front desk, no explanation and no apology. Will not be staying again at this place, as there are many other alternatives in the area that are much, much nicer.",1.0,1
"Not Sheraton Worthy
I stayed at the Sheraton on Friday night. The room was just ok. There was nothing fancy about it. The alarm in the room went off at 6am. We didn't set it and it was our only morning to sleep in; this seems like something the housekeepers should always check when turning the room. The coffee pot in the room was broken. There was a water marked complimentary that I was charged $2 for. I used it to attempt to make coffee in the broken coffee pot. I couldn't get the room very cold. The fan worked but it just wouldn't get very cool. The food in the breakfast buffet had been sitting there for a long time and the wait staff was inattentive. We had to go fetch someone to get water and then again for juice. There was one bar of soap for the sink and the shower. This is really wrong. You had to get out of the shower to go get the soap. I was there on a bed and breakfast rate. I wished we had gone elsewhere for breakfast and booked the less expensive rate. When I complained to the front desk about the coffee maker and the alarm, they offered me a complimentary small coffee and breakfast bread from their onsite coffee bar. We left with a bad taste in our mouth.",2.0,2
"Excellent choice
We had a seven night stay at the Hotel Beacon in a King suite on the 21st floor. As a couple of seniors who didn't want to be near the hustle & bustle of Times Square, we couldn't have made a better choice.
We had plenty of room, a kitchenette to prepare breakfast & other snacks & an extremely comfortable bed. The neighbourhood was great, so convenient to everything, local restaurants, the subway & Central Park. Having the Fairway market opposite was a bonus and the choice of foods was excellent.
My only criticism would be that the air conditioner was too loud & we had trouble adjusting it to suit us.
A few weeks later we had to return to Manhattan for one night & couldn't get a booking at the Beacon. We stayed in the midtown area in a similarly priced hotel. The comparison with the Beacon was like chalk & cheese. The Beacon was far superior in all respects.
If we every return to NYC we would only stay the the Beacon. We strongly recommend the Beacon.",5.0,5
"Great hotel, perfect location
We were given a great room with a view over the lake. The hotel is brilliantly situated within walking distance of the art institute, the arctitecture place and also the Willis tower. Not to mention the lake, the shops, the Loop - an ideal location and the staff are excellent. The security guard happily volunteered to show us Al Capone's former suite - now the bridal suite!
The only problem was a lack of hot water in the evenings for a bath but it really didn't matter too much.",5.0,5
"Stay away
This seemed to be a good deal on a weekend when inner harbor hotels were sold out or very expensive, but I immediately wished I had booked somewhere else. The door lock on the room I was originally put in did not work at all. It took a hour for someone to show up to confirm that the door did not lock. The room I was moved to was directly across the parking lot from a bar and I was kept up half the night by yelling and fighting outside. Bedding, carpet and curtains were filthy and full of holes. Stay somewhere else if you would actually like to get some rest.",1.0,1

"Decent Hotel, Excellent Location
Having lived in Seattle for 29 years, I never had a personal need to stay at a hotel. Since we have moved away, I stayed at the Inn recently on a trip back to Seattle. For $84/night, you really can't beat that rate!
The hotel is located on lower Queen Anne. Queen Anne is the neighborhood next to downtown Seattle, so a great, vibrant neighborhood close to everything. Easy access to I-5, a quick bus ride/walk/cab to downtown Seattle (less than 2 miles), a block from Key Area, and maybe only a mile to the Seattle waterfront. Queen Anne is divided into 2 neighborhoods - upper and lower Queen Anne. Both parts of ""the hill"" have great restaurants and cute shops, but lower Queen Anne has a younger, more urban vibe while upper Queen Anne is more residential. 
The hotel room was clean, service was friendly, but the hotel is relatively no frills. I may have a different opinion if I had visited the rooftop deck, which looks pretty amazing from the pictures on Trip Advisor. The window in my room looked into other rooms. It was a little disappointing that wi-fi was not free, as I feel like so many hotels offer free wi-fi now. I did really love the Starbucks access from the lobby - a true sign you're in Seattle!
I believe parking was $15, and I recommend it, as parking is scarce since this hotel is so close to Key Arena and downtown. 
Some great places in the neighborhood are Peso's or Laredo's (both are Mexican restaurants with fun bars), The Great Nabob for a neighborhood bar with good local beer on tap, The Sitting Room for a cozy glass of wine and European-style hors d'oeuvres, and don't forget 2 Seattle institutions for casual dining - Pagliacci's Pizza and Dick's Drive-In hamburgers... both within a block of the Inn.",3.0,3
"Pleasantly surprised!
We stayed here for a week while attending the Boston Terrier Club of America National Specialty show. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel and attention to detail. The restaurant provided just what we needed in a convenient and quick manner, room service was good and handy, meeting rooms and ballrooms were spacious and inviting, guest rooms were spacious and well appointed, and most importantly, the staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. I needed some special help...dry cleaning, deliveries, copies made...and everyone I spoke to knew how to handle things and did so in a most friendly and kind way. Henry behind the front desk was particularly friendly and helpful, and I know of many guests staying there that week who mentioned how helpful he was and if you needed anything, just ask Henry. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we appreciated the hotel being so welcoming to hundreds of Boston Terriers and their people.",4.0,4
"The worse place I've ever been
Unfriendly, rude woman @ the front desk, she did not find my reservation, but gave me a room. Upon my entry the room beds were still not done from whoever used them last time. The rude woman changed me to another room. the fridge did not work, the door security latch was missing (some one left it inside the bathroom) I had a reservation for the day after tomorrow, but I call to cancell. the same woman @ the front couldn't find me and said I didn't have to worry about it. I ended up with a charge in my credit card for the night I did not spend there, which I'm disputing now. I talked to Toney, the Mngr, he's requesting me proof I've talked to the woman and that I should have a conf. #.. how come if Tony and the receptionist have conspired to tell people who wants to cancel a reservation that they're not in their sistem and the next thing you know is that they make the charge in your credit card as if you did not even attempt to cancell.. they engage in deception practices to deprive you money DO NOT GO to the place.

31st floor river view room was unbeatable. Regardless of what floor you're on, ask security to take you up to the roof top conference room for a great photo op.

"Mayflower Park Seattle
We've stayed here a couple of times because the location is ideal. This trip wasn't our best. We were there overnight because I did the Danskin Triathlon on August 19. We had our 6-year old son and because I wanted to get a good nights sleep before the race we went to our room early after having dinner at Andaluca. The dinner was expensive and portions were very small. After dinner my husband asked the bartender for a glass a wine to take to the room and he wouldn't sell it to him. We thought that was odd. He told my husband that he needed to go through his waiter but we had already paid the bill. The other thing that bothered us is that in the restaurant we were charged either 18 or 22% automatic gratuity because we had a large party but there was only 7 of us and 1 person didn't even eat. My husband never ended up getting a glass of wine. Then we went to our room and had promised our son we would rent him a movie. No movies available. We won't be staying at this hotel again- bad service, especially in the restaurant.",2.0,2
"Terrible bathrooms and noisy heater
The staff was very nice and the attached Japanese restaurant was really good, however, the rooms here are in terrible shape. Mainly the bathrooms. The first was moldy and the toilet did not flush.

The beds were comfortable though. The location is great if you are going to be around Times Square.",2.0,2
"This hotel was a convenient so-so
This hotel is in the best location for sight seeing, yet the decor and service was just so-so. My husband was on business, so the location of the hotel was a must for him, and was within walking distance to the mall, the capitol, washington monument, ect. The hotel is also very close to the Capitol City metro, which made for an easy sight seeing trip for me. I would have enjoyed a vending machine at least in the building (there was none), but the Chinese delivery set up by the hotel as room service was a nice feature. I would stay here again if given the same average rate $$ I got last time...Just make sure you bring a few drinks or snacks to stock your fridge.",3.0,3
"Adequate for a few days, good location
Like many buildings in Boston, this hotel possesses some lovely architectural features. Sadly it is now gulfed by a hideous parking garage (our view). Once inside the actual rooms, however, you discover a decor and furnishings that have long given up. We are not overly particular, but expect nooks and crannies in the bathroom to be clean and the tub to not have bits flaking off. As mentioned-furniture chipped, damaged, over-sized etc, tiny TV and bedspreads in need of retirement. Pluses-Coffee and tea provided, as well as iron and hair dryer, continental breakfast respectable(and included for us) but not stellar and location (and free wi-fi!). Staff was not rude, but not the friendliest or engaged we've come across. I imagine most of their business is related to their conference facilities.",3.0,3
"Expensive but Good Location
I've stayed at this hotel several times for business, but this hotel is not for everyone. Here's my list of the good and the bad:
Good
1) Friendly and quick check-in. This hotel appears to be a high volume hotel, and the front desk staff gets you in and out quickly. There has always been at least two people at the check-in desk when I have been there. The check-in service is nothing memorable, but nothing negative to speak of either.
2) The location is excellent if you need to access downtown area or convention center quickly.
3) Running trails are adjacent to hotel property. If running or biking is your thing, then this hotel is a good pick for you. The trail runs alongside the lake adjacent to the hotel and goes for at least three miles. I only ran three miles and then turned around.
4) Clean rooms. I've never had an issue with a dirty room here. All of the rooms I've stayed in have been clean and stocked properly.
5) Full service hotel. I rarely ever have the need for a full service hotel, but every now and then it's nice to order room service or have a beer at the bar.
Bad
1) Price. The room prices are ridiculous at this hotel as well as others in the downtown area. If you don't mind being a short drive from downtown, there are much cheaper hotels to choose from in Buda, Sunset Valley, Pflugerville, Round Rock or the airport. Do not stay here if you're looking for a cheaper rate.
2) Parking. Parking can be a pain to figure out the first few times. There's a parking garage, but you have to take two different elevators to finally get to your room. Additionally, the parking spots are very narrow. On one occasion I had significant hood damage on my car from someone backing into it.
3) Rooms are nothing special. The rooms here are standard, older hotel rooms and nothing to be excited about (but they are clean). Some rooms have a nice view overlooking the lake, but you could also get a room overlooking the aweful Austin traffic on I-35.
4) The pool area is very small. I took my wife and two kids here one time and we were ok until three other people showed up to swim. It was too crowded after that.
5) TV is not HD. I'm still surprised at this one. Why would I want to pay twice the price for a hotel room and not get HD television? Just saying.
6) Internet is about as slow as it gets. If you have a 4G data tether option on your phone, don't even bother with the hotel internet connection. My connection speed was 5x faster on my phone than the hotel connection. It's hard to believe that a place this expensive doesn't even have up-to-date internet speeds. One more thing... what's up with changing the internet password the next day? Such a pain.",3.0,3

"Great experience
Great location near Grand Central. Albert was excellent and Denise was very helpful. The room was the biggest we have ever had in NYC at that price and the beakers are a nice touch. The steak house Benjamin's is in the hotel and is average priced for NYC. The steaks were excellent and the a la carte sides were easily shared by three but our waiter was obviously just going to give us the bare minimum service. The head waiter was attentive and probably would have addressed my concerns but I just tipped the slackard accordingly. The valet parking is $45 and pretty timely even though the lot on 33rd St. Nice elevators too!",4.0,4
"Dog poop!
The service was rude, hotel was not maintained, ripped carpet, dirty, stained. They did not fix my broken toilet, or loud heater. They made various billing errors.

"Convenient place right next to Holiwood boulevard
This HIE has very large rooms, a pool , a large breakfast area and located just 1 bloc from hollywood boulevard, next to the former Kodak theater. It is a perfect spot for a few days here. No car? ask the front desk for the bus and metro route for the major attractions, they will provide you a list of destinations and how to get there. 
the pool is very convenient for the end of the day relax-time. Across the street is a minimart, a pizza parlor and a subway restaurant - very convenient if too tired to walk for restaurant dining.",4.0,4
"Highly overrated
Cheap hotel - yes, but not really a steal. Poor breakfast and dark room. Helpful staff but I would rather stay somewhere else. Keep in mind that this is a 2 star hotel and when some gives this hotel 4 to 5 on the rating scale it is with this in mind. This has few amenities and is located in a somewhat suspicion neighborhood.",2.0,2
"A true joy of life !
The Galleria Park was a great hotel experience in the heart of the city. It was an amazing location for shopping, restaurants, exploring the area on foot, and public transportation. My room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the city. Details such as art, bathroom amenities, a firm mattress and great pillows, and a work desk were all appreciated. The wine reception in the evening underscored the warm welcome I received from the hotel staff. I was grateful for courtesies extended to me such as shopping and restaurant recommendations (the tip about a great sushi place was spot on), the option of a town car for my use, and storing my luggage on the day of check-out. I was impressed, also, with the green initiatives taken by the hotel, including recycling and paper reduction. I plan to return to this property on my next visit to San Francisco.",5.0,5
"Best deal
My husband and I live in Dallas, but we love to stay at the Magnolia as often as we can, just to get away close to home. The staff is always courteous and helpful and the rooms are nothing short of impeccable every time. We love everything from the decor to the overall ambiance. For the price, you really can't get a better deal downtown. Complimentary beer and wine reception, milk and cookies before bedtime and complimentary hot breakfast in the morning. Once on their email list, you don't get bombarded with junk mail, but you do often get emails for special deals. The one recently we took advantage of included parking for the weekend. Overall, the Magnolia is a wonderful and iconic hotel and definitely one of my top choices in Dallas. Please note that they do not have a pool or a spa. I assume it has a little to do with the history behind the hotel being a business building before it was turned into a hotel.",5.0,5
"Good location and value for money
We were staying in San Diego for one night and wanted to be near the airport and not too far from main thoroughfares and access to Sea World. The Vagabond Inn was only 5 minutes from the airport, right near Shelter Island (restaurants, nice views) and about 10 minutes from Sea World via an easy, non-freeway route. We booked through Hotels.com for $64 / night. The room was neat and clean, furniture seemed very old and a bit beat up, but linens were updated and the bathroom was partially renovated. We didn't eat the continental breakfast, but it looked pretty skimpy - just some muffins and danishes. Overall, this hotel was decent for the price.",3.0,3
"An Evening of Romance
My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for one night on 6/16. We were celebrating our 5-year anniversary. At check-in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite in honor of our anniversary- it was definitely a nice surprise. 
Upon entering the room we were very impressed with how beautiful and romantic it was with the dim lighting and classical music playing softly in the background. Then, we discovered that the hotel had sent us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. We opened the champagne we decided to take a seat in the beautiful living area. It was at this moment that my boyfriend decided to propose to me!!! He had planned to do it later that evening, but the ambience the hotel created made him decide that it was the perfect time and place.
 As some one who has previously worked in the hospitality industry and with over 8 years of experience in customer service; I am very hard to impress. Let me tell you that I was absolutely floored by service we received. My only regret is that we did not have time to enjoy all of the hotel's amenities or dine in the bar or restaurant. 
This stay was definitely a memorable one and you can rest assured that the Hotel Valencia will be our only choice when staying at the riverwalk. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!",5.0,5
"four stars include price and staff
the average may not convey all that's good about this. the reasonable price would make it a four-star hotel. our room was large, the beds were comfortable, and it was very clean. the staff was perhaps the best thing of all, as they were helpful and accomodating.
they include breakfast in the price, altho the hot food was not as good as should be, while the rest were good choices. the location is excellent for downtown (not inner harbor) baltimore, quiet and within easy walking distance to peabody and the walters museum, and easy driving to the harbor area. parking is not free, but a more reasonable rate than most. we would stay here again.",4.0,4
"Not the 4 star experience I was expecting...
My son and I arrived by car on Thursday the 12th of July, 2012 for 4 nights. We actually came up a day early, looking forward to our time in NYC. In the four days we were in Manhattan the only rude, discourteous experience we had was with the front desk staff at this hotel- management no less. The rest of the staff was apologetic and accommodating and tried to correct their errors, but couldn't do so without the management's authority. 
My hotel arrangements were made on my behalf through a 3rd party such as this site. My room was paid for in advance. $128/per night- supposedly a savings off the rack rate of $226/per night for a 4 star in TriBeCa. I will first say that the hotel is clean and neat and what I would expect for a 2 1/2-3 star accommodations, Otherwise, it fell short on amenities and service, especially service (no concierge or club level service that I could see, no refreshments, nothing and I mean nothing complimentary to make you feel welcome). I gave them my credit card at check in for incidentals, only to be charged $621.00 for my stay although I had already pre-paid. I was also given a king room to share with my 20 yr old son, and refused any other accommodations although I offered to pay the difference. The manager on duty was snarky and proceeded to lecture me about going through third party vendors for my accommodations, as they can't guarantee the room type for that price. I reminded the manager, I was only asking for TWO beds, and I was wiling to pay the difference. I was told there were no rooms with two beds, not even a suite (not even a sleeper sofa), and that they were oversold and couldn't accommodate the people coming in. She proceeded to make calls to another Sheraton hotel at my proding to see if they had a room with two beds, but I was have to pay the difference in price I was told. After she started to go through the list of hotels, I dismissed her effort as I reminded her there was a purpose to our trip and we couldn't be delayed any further. There was no empathy for the position we had been put in- in fact, she acted as thought she was doing us a favor to let us stay there. Her behavior was the most HOSTILE I have ever experienced from someone in the hospitality industry.
To add insult to injury, we ordered chocolate cake from room service on July 14th of our stay and became very ill. We could hardly leave our 10x10 cell of a room. When we did leave, it took several phone calls and trips to the front desk to get the $621.00 cancelled out of their system, although they ""claimed"" they had contacted my bank the day before to do so. LIE. I spoke to my bank at the front desk, and was instructed that all the hotel needed to do was cancel the charge out of THEIR system, which they had not done. My bank would update the balance in 48 hours. The money was NOT the point, the point was UNAUTHORIZED charges to my card. It's called FRAUD. 
When we left on Monday the 16th and my car was brought to me, there was a large splat in the center of my hood that was rust in color. It appeared something had dripped on my hood wherever they had parked my car. There were scratches along the driver's side door as if someone had tried to get in the vehicle. My back up camera no longer works and the manual hood latch is disabled. 
I have tried on several occasions since Monday to contact Lowell Bebe-Center to no avail. 
I have been told he is ""away from his desk"". I have been told a manager on duty will contact me. 
We'll see, but I'm not waiting to take action. The only souls on that front desk who showed a pittance of kindness was Andrea and Giselle. BTW- I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, but I've never seen it as an advantage, so I've given up trying to use it. I recommend staying away from the Starwood Brand.

"Cheap as S.....
This is not for you!
I love taking a well deserved vacation like anyone else. When I go on vacation I want to be able to have a great time and I pay and expect a certain level of service that always starts with 3 fundamental parts. Location, attitude and quality of hotel. This hotel only has one out of three and in this world we live in 1 out of 3 is horrible. There is a song from the 80s from Meat loaf that says 2 out of 3 ain't bad. That was in the 80ies today 2 out of 3 is ok and ok is terrible. So Why settle for less when you can do much better! This place is bellow terrible with only location, in front of the Park to brag about. In service and cleanliness and upkeep and attitude and service. This place just does not want it for you. Its a choice and they choose not to provide it for you. If you want more for your well earned money, go to a place that truly values its customer and really strive to take care of them to provide an experience. Values do count for me because they make a difference in how you treat people in how you invest in hoy you act. and you can see values in action in the attitude of the staff, in the upkeep of the place and you can see it in the details.This place falls way short of in all accounts and I would recommend you to Go some place else.When you arrive at the Helmsley Park Lane, from the moment you arrive the way people greet you at the door all the way up to your room make you feel like a line at MCdonalds. Its more about pushing you on through than servicing you. But where this hotel falls apart is in its upkeep. you get the feeling that this hotel is just milking it and getting away with it. You almost get the sense that there is a very greedy wealthy owner that only cares about profit and will make no investment in up-keeping this hotel. Its like a trip to a terrible boarding school you were sent away as a punishment. And it gets worse. the rug in your room was so bad I had to walked in my shoes from my bed to the bathroom. And the bathroom is falling apart. The walls are coming apart, the place is just dirty with the tiles full of guuuuk. . it feels like a century landed on it. Not very nice to provide this type of experience. So please don cheat yourself of a vacation. Go some place where you know they care.",1.0,1
"Took Good Care of Road Weary
My flight from DFW was cancelled as I was walking down the Jetway to board. This after a 2.5 hour delay. No more flights out because of storms at home. Left to our own devices by the airline, my colleague and I settled on Holiday Inn Express. We accidentally took the Holiday Inn shuttle. When we arrived the night manager, Jimmy Sherman, rather than sending us back to the airport to catch the right shuttle, honored our government per diem and then comped us a drink at the hotel bar. The night improved as it was salsa night. A horrible business trip turned into a great one, all because Jimmy lightened our burden with his excellent customer service. I am a Holiday Inn Express awards member. I will highly recommend Holiday Inn DFW to all of my colleagues.",5.0,5
"Tired and In Desperate Need of a Face Lift
As a Hilton Diamond Member, I have had many opportunities to stay in Hilton properties in many different states. Usually, things go rather well, and that is why I stay with the Hilton chain. But this hotel in Memphis, is the worst Hilton experience I have yet had. Upon check-in, I was given the key to someone else's room. When I opened the room door, there stood another guest - wide eyed and not expecting an intruder. The next room brought hairs all over the bathroom floor, needles on the carpet next to the bed, and filthy carpet. When I went to the business center, there was no tape dispenser, nothing to write with, and a copy machine that would not function. Again, this is an exception to Hilton. I will NOT return to this property, since there are just too many faults.",1.0,1
"Filthy Hotel
The Lobby is decieving. When I walked in the lobby looked clean and updated. As I walked to my room the halls were dark and walls and doors were very dirty. My room smelled so bad I had to cover my nose. I asked the desk to have someone come up and change out the molded and sour shower curtian which helped. The carpets were just filthy. It looks like the owner has invested allot of money in renovations but has not hired good management. I had no washcloths no hand towels no bath matt only two bath towels. I checked out a day early as I could not bring myself to sleep in that filth one more night!!!I will NEVER stay there again!!!",1.0,1
"Awesome Location and Friendly Staff
We recently stayed at the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel due to reading other peoples reviews of this hotel and it lived up to its reviews. We stayed for a total of 10 nights at this hotel, 5 nights in one stay and then went back for another 5 nights after visting vegas and every night was great. We also loved that there was breakfast provided every morning, it was easy and it was yummy. The rooms were clean and well presented and the staff were AMAZINGLY helpful, providing us with maps of how to get to all the sites we wanted to see in LA and hollywood. But the main attraction for this hotel is the location, it is just around the corner from the walk of fame, it has a bus stop around the corner, the subway is a very short walk to get to and there is a supermarket and pharmacy close by that you could go and get supplies from and bring back to your room to store in the fridge provided. Overall we had a fantastic experience at HCH and would go back there again if we were to visit America again",5.0,5
"avoid this badly run dump
this characterless dump has major maintenance problems, indifferent staff and an unhygienic and unpleasant eating area. specifically-
- toilet flush didn't work properly/bathroom sink was coming away from the wall, bedroom walls were dirty.
- sullen and unhelpful staff at the front desk added further to the general air of unpleasantness
- the breakfast room is in an airless small overcrowded cellar. breakfast bread and coffee quickly disappeared and want replenished.

"Great choice for visiting NYC
Really happy with our stay at the Distrikt. It is very clean, modern and comfortable. It’s a small boutique hotel, with only 5 rooms per floor, generally quiet. We booked a view room and ended up on the top floor, with a great view of the west side, Hudson river and lights near Times Square a few blocks away.
The room itself is adequately sized, not spacious but not cramped, with an extremely comfortable bed and good lighting. Amenities include an iron and board, Keurig coffee maker with two coffee and two tea pods complimentary per day, and free wifi. The bathroom was nicely appointed and a decent size, with lots of counter space for your stuff, great water pressure in the shower and a good hairdryer. On arrival we found two (packaged) brownies as a welcome, and each evening the turndown service includes a couple chocolate squares and a card indicating the next day’s weather, a nice touch. 
The property doesn’t have a lot of facilities, other than a bar/restaurant on the main floor. We only had one breakfast there, it was good and not overpriced for a city hotel – you can get the continental for $10 which includes fruit, cereal, yogurt, pastries, and hard boiled eggs, or they also have other items to order off the menu. They offer free coffee in the lobby in the morning, and two flavors of iced tea in the afternoons. There are also three computers available along the front of the lobby.
Service was friendly and helpful; we got a great dinner recommendation one night. We didn’t ask a lot but they were great about helping with the questions we did have. And they regularly offer some extra fun surprises for their guests, such as having a food truck out front giving out free food at “happy hour” – the day we arrived, they were doing made-to-order ice cream sandwiches from 4 to 6. Yum! On the other hand, they lack a few of the basics one generally can count on in larger hotels – no postage stamps for sale at the front desk, and it was hit or miss whether we could get change for a $20 bill. 
The midtown location is very convenient for tourist activities. A few blocks from Times Square and the theater district, and very near the starting point for the hop-on, hop-off busses. Being right across the street from the Port Authority bus terminal, it’s very easy to use the subway. That also means you have all the crowds of people going in & out, but they’re around the corner, not on the side facing the hotel. And yes, there is a parole office on this block, which sometimes had a line of people outside, but it never felt uncomfortable or unsafe walking back to our hotel at any time of day or night. There are three other hotels immediately adjacent to the Distrikt, all tall skinny properties lined up in a row. And just up 9th Avenue begins the Hells Kitchen restaurant row, several blocks with a variety of good restaurants.
All in all, I highly recommend the Distrikt – it’s a great base for exploring the city, appropriately priced and very comfortable, with a fun and welcoming atmosphere.",4.0,4
"More like a sleezy lonely hearts club
When i think of this chain i usually think upscale. This one though i definitely not. At night the beautiful lobby turns into a honky tonk complete with live music and aging locals on the prowl. Not what you want or expect at a Ritz. At breakfast the service was very poor, taking forever to get coffee and even longer for refills. There are hobos on the street outside. Cops patrol the outside constantly, which is not comforting. In the gym they play hiphop on the loudspeakers so loud you hear it through your own headphones and there is no attendant to turn it down. Once inside the room, it seemed like a ritz, everything perfect and as it should be. But step outside your room its like more like a holiday inn.",2.0,2
"Really should not be rated four stars...
This is a great hotel if you want to be in the middle of tourist world. The vast majority of people lined up to check in (we checked in late afternoon and waited 20 minutes) were folks with online, bargain cut rates. 
The hotel was pleasant enough, just not up to the above average expected from a four star. The building has aged, and they clearly are trying to keep some of the aged charm (hardware around elevators, signs, etc) but it almost felt dated. Hard to describe, but some hotels pull the charm off with solid spit and polish, the New Yorker tries to do it more with a quick coat of paint. Once upstairs, the carpets are beat, wallpaper is kind of beat, etc. I guess the word would be worn.
The room was comfortable, although the mattress was less than supportive. I absolutely do not excuse bed linens, especially sheets, that are synthetic and scratchy, at best. For this rate and rating, I expect cotton or other natural fabric, and I expect it to be plush. The other issue was a bathroom without ventilation. While I get the age of the building, paint over tile, instead of a tile replacement, and a bathroom full of steam after a shower is again, short of four star expectations.
This hotel is perfect for a first or second tourist visit to Manahattan. Location is central, with an easy walk train, subway, Madison Square, Times Square, the Empire State Building. But for either the seasoned New York visitor or regular hotel traveler, this is not the best choice.",3.0,3
"Good Location, BUT not so great experience
The location is good, easy acces out of manhattan to the airport, and easy acccess to trainstations, bus stops and what have you.
I got there around past 12 noon, they told me checking in time is 3pm and they have no room ready or me yet but they could likely have one within the hour, so they took my phone number and said they would call me.
The place looked gloomy and dark, very unlike what I expect from NYC, the carpets curtains wallpaper etc are just dark. Also looked like a refugee camp with many ppl and their luggage waiting forrooms to be ready( the waiting area is right by the reception, not much of a demarcaton.
 At 315 when I got no phone call I went back to the reception and they checked me into my room(wondering why I didnt get a phone call but whatever, they gave me a yummy welcome cookie).
My room(10th floor) looked as dark as downstairs, I could see the renovation work and it wasnt very impressive, the place still looks old esp the bathroom and sink areak. The bed and sheets were nice and comfy tho. I wouldve appreciated a complimentary bottle water to wash the cookie down with but hey.
Next few minutes I thought I heard my door pen n shut but it was my neighbors door, this happened several times during my stay. The hallway noises and doors can be heard clearly and closely.
There is a fire station somewhere next to the building, I believe on the other side, not the side facing the front of the hotel (lexingting ave), I heard firefighters (or was it police) several times as well.Earplugs are available on request though.
I didnt get any kind of turnaround service, apar from my receipt being slid under my door saying ""no ned to see us when you are checking out"" gee thanks for the golden boot!
Generally I just didnt feel at home, maybe im just a brat or something. Good luck!",2.0,2
"Good and Bad at a Tired Hotel
Positives: Close to Alamodome and Rivercenter. Breakfast is included. Small pool and fitness room are there (but we didn't use them). Ice water always available. (A nice touch would have been to add some lemon or limes to the water.) Very comfortable, open lobby area. Lots of parking in decent-sized spaces.
Negatives: If you want good internet service, DON'T stay here. It cuts out periodically, so it's very frustrating, especially when you need to use the internet for work as you're on vacation. Other guests told me the wi-fi on their smart phones kept cutting out, too. Some employees were very helpful, but others were cranky. This hotel seems very tired - hallways seemed dim and dirty and smelled of smoke. Our room was fine except for the showerhead facing at us when we turned it on. (Note to housekeeping staff - that's NOT funny!) Not safe to walk anywhere after dark.",3.0,3
"Centrally located
Everytime I have gone to San Diego for work, the company has put us up at the Best Western Plus Bayside Inn.

It is centrally located in the downtown area close to the airport, The Gas Lamp District, the Harbor, Little Italy and the MTS Trains. The only issues I have with this hotel is that there is no room service for dinner on the weekends and the attached restaurant is not open after breakfast on Sat or Sun. and dependig on the room, the wireless internet can be spotty.

The staff is extremely helpful if you are looking for options to explore LA and the surrounding area they will guide you in the right direction.

"Literally first overnight guests...need to work out the kinks
First off let me say that we were actually their first overnight guests. The hotel had just opened the day we checked in. While the hotel decor and furnishings are new, clean and very modern, they do have some kinks to work out but have no doubt they will. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly, especially Kristina. Our room was very nice and on the 10th floor. They have only 5 rooms per floor. There will be a roof top bar opening very soon. We were taken up by a staff member and shown the area that will be the patio. Views are wonderful. They have a small bar/lounge in the lobby but it was not open yet. Wish it would have been so we could have enjoyed a drink there. In our room, 1 of the TVs was not working and an employee came right up and fixed the problem. We had a mini fridge in our room too but they have them all enclosed in a cabinent and were having problems with them all over heating and not working as in the case of ours. The same employee came up and moved the mini fridge to a different part of the room and by morning it was working again. However, we had leftovers from dinner that we needed to keep cold so they put them in their main kitchen fridge overnight for us. We had no hot water in our tub but we didnt even use it. The shower was very nice with a rainfall shower head. They have TVs in the bathroom mirrors but had not delivered the remotes to the rooms yet so we could not use it. Another thing that we didnt figure out was where the ice was. I asked a housekeeper and she took my bucket and said she would be back in a few minutes. It was very nice of her but we could not find where the ice machine was for ourselves. They also had no written info in the room about the hotel or how to call down to the front desk etc. I'm sure they just had not put them in the rooms yet. Overall our stay was nice just wish we would have arrived after they had been open for a few weeks so we could have enjoyed all The Ivy will have to offer without all the kinks. The only weird thing about the whole stay was when we called and booked, they asked if we were coming down for anything special and I replied our anniversary. Upon checkout the girl asked if they brought anything to us for our anniversary and we told her no. She left the counter and went to talk to another male employee and then returned to the desk and finished our checkout never mentioning anything again about our anniversray...it was very strange...so were we supposed to receive something and someone dropped the ball? I should mention that housekeeping did deliver a small plate with 1 chocolate covered strawberry and 2 other small pieces of chocolate to our room but they were delivering them to all the rooms, so I know that was not for our anniversary. We most likely will try them again once they have been established for awhile.",3.0,3

"Good for holiday, not for business
a very nice hotel, but maybe less so for business travelers. I needed to do a bit of work at nights and found the lack of a desk a bit difficult. there is a small portable wooden table but really would have needed a desk and a more comfortable chair to sit on and write. Coffee in the room would have been good and walls are a bit thin, I could hear my neighbors who were talking at a normal volume. Overall this is a good hotel for a holiday, but I probably would pick another if I come for business again. Against the flaws I mentioned, the staff are very helpful, the place is clean, and its always good to support a family run place as opposed to a faceless corporation. Highly recommended for a holiday, not so much for a business traveller.",3.0,3
"OK - but could be so much better
The variation in the standard of rooms at this hotel is enormous - some look really nice and some are barely OK. This, sadly, means that the customers with the loudest voices will get preferential treatment and upgrades - if you like to avoid confrontation, you will most likely have to put up with a shabby room.
Room 1431 is definitely one of the poorer rooms - air con/heating was madly noisy even when switched off! (and didn't work that well, either); decor was really tired with torn wallpaper, scuffed paintwork and worn carpet. Bath did not drain properly, meaning you take a shower standing in 6 inches of water! On the plus side, the room was quiet (apart from the heating!) - no sounds from other rooms and traffic noise not a problem.
This is a budget hotel, and unless you get a really poor room as I did, it does offer a very good deal for a NYC stay. Location and cleanliness were both excellent. Rooms were cleaned very efficiently every day. However, the service is very impersonal - even downright frosty at times. Check in desk staff are admittedly busy, but could make an effort to be more friendly - it doesn't cost anything, guys! And in 5 days, not a single doorman offered me so much as a smile, never mind a 'hello'. Apart from one very nice and efficient man who organised a car to the airport for me, no staff member made any effort to offer me any more than the barest minimum of politeness.
The diner (Park Cafe) attached to the hotel is great. Efficient, friendly staff and excellent basic diner fare, served with a smile until 1am. 
The elevators worked fine and I never had to wait more than a few moments. 
The lobby has hardly any seating, and at busy check-in/check-out times, it can be quite chaotic and unpleasant. It reminded me of being at an airport where all the flights have been suddenly cancelled!",3.0,3
"Spanky on the outside, beaten down on the inside
One night in downtown LA for a conference. The Sheraton has a nice lobby, and very friendly staff. The promise to call me when a room was available never materialized.

Illusions end with the elevators. The nice looking lobby transmogrified with the elevators. The room (17th floor) was just beaten beaten down. Tired old carpeting. Tired old furniture. Tired old wallpaper. Tired old bathroom fixtures. And, I'm sorry, but maybe nothing gets up my nose more than a $200/night hotel that comes with plastic cups in the bathroom instead of echte glass. C'mon!

We prefer modern interiors, so we were not impressed. The service however, is 5 star. So also expect to pay 5 star.

The room was quite spacious, with a separate sitting area and mini kitchen. There was even a walk-in closet! The vanity, located just outside the bathroom, was convenient, especially when someone else was using the toilet. HOWEVER, the bathroom itself, containing only a commode and a tub/shower, was SO SMALL, that, as my husband quipped, ""you had to step out just to change your mind!"" Seriously, you could not shut the door unless you put the toilet seat and lid up, because, if down, the door hit it! REALLY!

Booked a 2 bedroom suite for our family of 4 adults and 1 infant primarily because it was about 40% cheaper than any other suite/apartment we could find and it has free onsite parking.

BUT it is super affordable and located, literally, around the corner from the Powell-Mason turnaround near Fisherman's Wharf. The staff are kind of bland and lack any real enthusiasm. We had trouble finding things out from them; they know exactly where the closest restaurant, laundry and liquor store are but couldn't give us any general info about where to purchase 3 day passports for the MUNI system or any info on anything further afield (such as Alcatraz - the most visited attraction in San Francisco...). Another plus, it's around the corner from Pat's Cafe (amazing blueberry pancakes) :) and is easy walking distance from the bottom of the crooked part of Lombard st.

There is a Ralphs's grocery store right across the street and one (Pavillions if I recall) about 3 blocks blocks behind the hotel going towards Beverly Hills. Paul Mitchell hair products in the rooms.
The workout facilities are small and leave a bit to be desired and only one elevator goes to gym level. Get off at the lobby and walk down a flight to the gym is my suggestion as elevators are slow in the mornings.",4.0,4
"Park Plaza with Jet Blue Vacation Package
We just stayed one night at the Park Plaza in Boston through a Jet Blue Vacation Package. We could not have booked the flight and hotel separately and have gotten as good of a price. The location of the hotel is only 1 block from the Green T Line and only 1 block from a beautiful park. There are also several choices of restaurants in the immediate area. We have found that not to be the case in other Boston hotels that we have stayed in. 
I too read reviews about the hotel being past its prime, but the vacation package was too good to pass up. We ended up finding it very charming and cool. The hotel lobby is beautiful! The service at the registration desk was very good. Based upon other reviews, I asked for a high floor facing the street. Our room was on the 10th floor and we had nice city views. Based upon what I read online, I was practically expecting to be sleeping in a closet since there were lots of statements about the rooms being small. We were in a ""standard"" room and found ours to be an adequate size for 1 bed. The rooms have a cozy feel and have original hardware on the doors. The door to our room has a door within the door for valet/laundry service. We found this quite unique and were intrigued by it! Some past reviewers complained about the street noise, we just laughed about that because....well you are in a city! Yes, we did hear some traffic but is was not a problem for us. Regarding the walls being thin, at one point we did hear someone next door snoring loud enough that we could hear him but it was only temporary. If it had continued, we would have left the TV on low for some white noise. Even with this issue, we would still stay here again in the future. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom and room was clean and you can't beat the easy access to the Arlington T Subway Stop when you are visiting the city without a car! We took the subway right from the airport to the hotel with two easy train switches...Blue to Red to Green! All other cities should have subway access from the airport!
We ate at M.J. O’Connor’s Irish Pub for dinner and the food was delicious! It is located on the first floor of the hotel but you access it by going outside and down the street. We also ate breakfast at Au Bon Pain. A little take out place located on the first floor of the hotel. Again you access it by going outside and down the street.
For those who want to go shopping there are also high end boutiques nearby. The park is lovely and offers boat rides in swan shaped boats in the summer.
It is an old school hotel, the lobby is grand but if you are looking for marble sinks and extra large standard rooms this is not the place for you. When comparing prices with other hotels keep this in mind. Our vacation package with our flight made us consider it and we would definitely stay here again (even if we booked the hotel room and flight separately).",4.0,4
"Lovely, upscale property
We drove in to the city. Even with a GPS, we drove by the hotel twice. It's not well marked. We finally called the front desk and asked for help. (FTR, if you are on Tremont, turn left onto the side street just before the Beantown Pub.) 
Nine Zero's location is outstanding if you want to do Freedom Trail activities. It is a few blocks away from Boston Common, which was great because we met our Tour Guide there the next morning. There are restaurants, drug stores, shops, etc, all within walking distance. There are also tons of historical sites right in the area, as well as a short walk away. We loved the Boston Common area. 
Most of the time, the hotel staff went overboard to make us feel welcome. However, one notable time, we sat in the chairs in front of the concierge table for five minutes before anyone bothered to ask us if we needed anything. 
The feel of the hotel is formal, despite attempts to lighten up the mood with whimsical touches, such as animal prints and zebra robes. Perhaps it's the heavy drapery they use on the walls, or the historic feel of the building, but we felt under-dressed walking through the lobby in our shorts and t-shirts. 
The clientele at Nine Zero is an eclectic mix. For instance, the complimentary wine reception was attended by a large family, including young kids, business people, young hipsters, and couples. Not sure who their target audience is, but I'd not return unless it was just adults. Oddly enough, their atmosphere is more welcoming of dogs than kids.
The rooms were small, but they fit a lot in, including 2 queen beds, a flat screen t.v., and work desk. As a family traveling, we appreciated the queen beds because the kids were as comfortable as we were. We also appreciated the robes, which made sharing one bathroom easier.
The concierge recommended a restaurant called Scollay Square. We wouldn't recommend it. Rather, we'd recommend a hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Artu, which our tour guide recommended. It's a short walk from the hotel.",4.0,4
"Great place to stay
People from the lobby is very friendly and help me all the time.

"Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Chicago
Great place to stay for a trip with the boys. The hotel is centrally located, walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants, Michigan Avenue, the Willis Tower, Gino's East and the River.

"Great hotel in a great location
Stayed here for business over 3 days in March. The hotel is on the Riverwalk and is conveniently located to restaurants and the Alamo. The rooms are fairly nice, I stayed in a king suite. My room's seating area was pretty nice with a couch, couple of chairs with a table and flatscreen. Bathroom was off the short hallway connecting to the bedroom that also had a flatscreen.
The hotel staff were pretty helpful with restaurant recommendations. There are lots of restaurants on the riverwalk but many of them serve pretty bad food and take advantage of tourists. The hotel staff had very good recommendations for us on and off the riverwalk. They recommended Bohannon's, a steak house, and it was spectacular. The hotel restaurant/bar on the river level was pretty good. I only had breakfast and lunch at the restaurant and both meals were good.",4.0,4
"Most helpful staff
All the staff went out of their way to make our recent stay enjoyable. They got to know us and provided a cd and information for my wife to teach about Mexico to her 5th grade class and Alton went out of his way to help us when our rental car was towed from the street by a Houston restaurant.",5.0,5
"Stolen Credit Card
Myself and another member of my team from works stayed here for 3 days in January. Upon returning home, both of the credit cards we used to pay for our hotel stays were stolen and used at other hotels in other parts of the country. In both circumstances, they were for the same/similar amounts but we had no other shared transactions while in NY. This was the only place we both used those credit cards.
Morgans Hotel Group, please don't bother writing a response since I have contacted your office several times, been referred to the Hudson Hotel GM who never called me back, and contacted you again (after no GM results) - all with no effect. It seems like a pretty clear message: you're okay with whatever portion of your staff is stealing your guest's credit card numbers. 
I won't worry about that since I won't ever stay there again but I thought I should let others know.",1.0,1
"Best hotel/location/treatment
Went to NYC from South Florida for a ""girls"" weekend (3 of us) to celebrate a 60th birthday & stayed here from 10/26-10/28. Check in was easy/efficient. Special thanks to Keisha, who checked us in, and when told we were celebrating a special occasion, made sure to give us a great room on the 24th floor (overlooking the Chrysler Bldg) with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed (made up by the time we got back to our room in the late afternoon). The room was exceptionally clean, comfortable, large, and quiet. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on 2nd day and it was plentiful, tasty, and reasonably priced. You can choose the buffet or order from the menu. There was free freshly baked cookies in the lobby @ 5:00pm and free coffee on the 12th floor in the mornings. Every employee we encountered was friendly, respectful, efficient, and helpful; despite the stress they must have been feeling regarding the upcoming hurricane and their need to prepare and get home safely. Location of hotel was convenient to everything. Will never stay at any other hotel when visiting NYC in the future. Kudos to everyone working there this past weekend and hoping that no one was too adversely affected by Sandy.",5.0,5
"Dirty, run down, expensive B&B + suspected credit card fraud...
This place was so bad, we unpacked and repacked our car within an hour of arriving. The property was very run down and dirty, our guest room was dusty and sheets/towels were old and stained, there was a gas odor coming from the kitchen...could go on and on...the owner claims they do 25 weddings per year; however given the current condition of the property, this must be a complete fabrication. Even the patio/garden area was run down with a rotted out bench and rusty tables and chairs..In the end we decided to stay elsewhere. Of course the innkeeper charged us for the room even though this place is barely habitable.
Travelers beware! This is a sketchy B&B with a sketchy owner. The day after our credit card was charged for the room, there were two additional fraudulent charges made online with our credit card information. Luckily our bank froze the account before more damage was done.
My advice: Stay anywhere else, and if they already have your credit card information, cancel the card immediately.",1.0,1
"Could not care less
I used ""Priceline"" to book this hotel. The price was reasonable for San Diego, but not a steal. The hotel has a nice decor, and a fairly convenient location, but some of the facilities, especially the bathroom were rather old fashioned and not as comfortable as in newer hotels. My main complain, though, is about the the service - it is completely inadequate for a hotel of this class. It seems that nobody really care what is going on. You can't say that the managers and the hotel personnel are unfriendly - they are not - but they simply don't care about you; they seem to be preoccupied by their own problems, often lively discussing them with each other while you are standing by. 
On the night of my arrival I realized that the shower basin was clogged and called to let the desk know that there was a problem. They promised to take care of that but the next day it only got worse; the basin got overflown in the morning and the water seeped outside the bathroom. I had to get out of the shower and call them again and was late for my appointment that morning. When I mentioned it to the manager; he simply listened expressionlessly to it and made no comments; no apology was extended. On the day of my departure they failed to wake me up; I was too naive to have a back up alarm clock set up. By pure luck I woke up just in time to catch the train to get to the airport; otherwise, I would have surely missed my flight. The manager, who did not even have the decency to apologize offered to take one service fee - $15 (!) off the $600 bill. The hotel has a mandatory $15 a day fee that they don't advertize; as I bought the room through Priceline, I only leaned about it when I was checking in; as this fee was mandatory I felt that they should have included it in the room price in the first place. That said, the room was of a good size, clean and quiet, and the hotel restaurant was pretty decent - perhaps somewhat overpriced, but this is expected. So If you have no problems whatsoever - which probably happens more often than not -you may be OK.",2.0,2
"Great Location!
We stayed at The Madison with our family this past weekend, The hotel is really well located near the White house and all the museums.
The Rooms are very well appointed, and the complementary coffee in the room is a great touch.
Housekeeping did a very good job, so as the Bar and Front Desk.
The only reason why it is a 4 and not 5 for me, is because of the Porter/ Doorman service, We had to wait over 10 minutes to be greeted when we first arrived, and after returning from dinner, we waited for another 15 minutes, before I had to ask the bellman standing outside to park my car. This is not what I expect when I am paying $40 dollars a day for parking! Please improve that area and you will be the best Hotel in DC.
Besides that, what a great hotel!",4.0,4

"Sensational
The Argonaut Fisherman's Wharf is this funky nautical themed Hotel in a Fabulous location. The moment you arrive at the door, friendly staff are there to greet you with enthusiasm you cannot help but fall in love with the place. The hotel was under some renovations during our stay, however the disruption was minimal during the day. The rooms are funky and fun and we had a view of Golden Gate Bridge from our room. Happy Hour every afternoon a hoot. Adjacent Ghirardelli Square for gorgeous chocolate and desserts and the convenience of the Cable Cars into the city. Short walk takes you to Pier 39 and some great restaurants along the way. Blue Mermaid restaurant attached to the Argonaut had delicious breakfasts to start the day. Will definitely stay at this Hotel again. South Australian family January 2012",5.0,5
"Disappointing
An older Courtyard -- at least by the look and feel. And the staff has a can't-be-bothered attitude. Valet barely acknowledged me when I pulled up (when you're charging $43 a day for valet parking, the valet could afford to be on his game!). Front desk put me in the worst available room (right near the elevator), but left it for me to discover after I brought my luggage upstairs. It's cheaper than some other Marriott options in the heart of the city, but you get what you pay for...",2.0,2
"Not what I expected...
I guess I was expecting more based on their website pictures. In person its a lot different. Lobby has a nice tropical look with waterfall, but our room on the outskirts 200s was more like a motel. Room was very dark even with white walls. Our ""garden view"" consisted of some kind of palm tree and fencing. I gave it 2 stars because we did get a goodnite's sleep since there were no other guest around. I don't think I would pay more for bayview. For what I paid and what you get, I should have been given a bay view.",2.0,2
"Great service.
My husband and I stayed here as an early Valentine's celebration. The staff was very informative and accommodating.. especially Ahmad Bellman. He let us know about all of the hotel amenities and services with a friendly attitude, great sense of humor, and genuine kindness. We have stayed at The Westin before and each time it is continual great service. We have decided to use this hotel for all of our vacation stays from now on. The only suggestion I would make would be to not charge for Wi-fi or other amenities. I have been to other lower scale hotels that let you use wi-fi for free and also offer you little travel items you may have forgotten without charge.",5.0,5
"Great location for parts of DC, but challenges for families
I stayed at the Liaison with my wife and son for 4 nights, in a room with 2 queen beds. It was extremely convenient to Union Station (we arrived by train), and an easy walk to the Metro at Union Station, Capitol Hill, and the Smithsonian museums at the east end of the Mall. 
However, by the end of the week the small size of the room (particularly the bathroom) left us feeling claustrophobic. In particular, the shower and sink were all in the same room, without an outlet to plug in appliances such as a hair dryer. In fact, we had to move items off the furniture, to have room, and then got charged for drinking the in room bottled water (which was simply stored in the cabinet) - the charge was immediately removed when we pointed it out. Also, the perks - the tour kit, special pillows, and exercise kit - were not really worth the effort; the iPod tour was unexceptional, and the exercise kit needed a DVD player which the hotel had run out of. Finally, the beds were elevated quite high, which I have frequently seen on business trips, but which was uncomfortable for family members.
Also, there wasn't any lounge or lobby area for a quiet place to read or relax. The lobby (with WiFi access) is adjacent to the restaurant and bar, which get quite loud. The pool on the roof was not as bad, and had a lifeguard.
The staff tried to be helpful, and generally succeeded; the concierge Michelle even reached out to us before we arrived in response to a question I had sent about a tour. (We drank a lot of the excellent punch by the front door.) These constructive suggestions did not detract from having a great DC vacation, but from the hotel's reputation, and the praise from a work colleague who had attended a wedding there, we had hoped for a better experience. (We avoided the restaurant because of its prices, in favor of nearby Subway sandwich shops, and our ""splurge"" meals at the Capitol and the Smithsonian.)",3.0,3
"Great hotel - can't beat location and amazing staff
This hotel is a great location if you are going to DC for work or on vacation. It is close to the White House, right by the metro and surrounded by great restaurants. The room was spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've had in a hotel. The staff were exceedingly friendly - everyone from the doormen to the front desk staff, the bartender and room service went above and beyond responding to requests, helping me with last minute reservation changes and generally making sure my stay was enjoyable. I have recommended this hotel to friends and family looking to visit the DC area and would stay there again without hesitation.",5.0,5

Finally I found a cockroach in my room. Would not stay here again under any circumstances.",1.0,1
"Embassy Suites Phoenix Airport
I typically stay in Embassy Suites or Hampton Inns. I would say however that this particular hotel doesn't do anything for the Hilton/Embassy Suites brand. It is overdue for an overhaul. The air conditioner basically didn't work (think Phoenix at 107 degrees). The filter for the air conditioner was dirty. The counter person was alone and it took 20 minutes to get checked-in. It is also in a rather ""tough"" part of town. Not everything was a problem. The van drivers were pleasant.",2.0,2

The only downside was the breakfast: not much choice for this standard of hotel.

Live music some nights. Rates are reasonable for NYC, and the location makes getting anywhere pretty easy. My room was quiet- free from horn honking and other noise I expected in NYC.

"Don't stay here! Hotel being demolished this week
We checked into this hotel on June 8th and if your kids hadn't been so tired we would have checked out that same day. This hotel is being demolished this week and it would have been nice if they had warned us that they had already removed the ice machines from all the floors but the main floor. There was mold on the elevator wall, the pool was not working and we were told that we could go to the hotel next door. When we booked the hotel they advertised there was a pool. The rooms had not been maintained nor had the AC. We rented 3 rooms and there was mold in the bathrooms and holes in the walls. There was not even an offer of a discount or a way that they could rectify the problem. They didn't care because they were being torn down. I have stayed in some run down hotels on tours with our kids choir groups and not once have I ever left a hotel in disgust. This is the first for our family. Don't stay here! How can a company in good conscience charge full price for a hotel that is only 50% functional?

The location of this hotel is excellent and the staff is wonderful. Even the restaurant's food is above average, so if you need to eat in a pinch, it works. The reason why I couldn't rate this hotel higher is the outdated and somewhat ill repair of the rooms. Although there is a flat screen TV and an in-room safe for your valuables, the furniture, bathroom fixtures, and the like are way out of date and, in some cases, kind of cruddy. Also annoying was that the ""office-type"" chair could not come up to the height needed to work at the desk. I'm no shorty so I know this would be a problem for a lot of folks. The solution? I took some pillows from the bed to add height. Again, not a bad place to stay, just needs some renovation.",3.0,3
"Good Choice
This hotel worked fine for us on a recent 5 night stay in New York. I'm not raving about it, but the price, location and amenities were a good value. The room was big enough and the bed was comfortable. Our main complaint was that are no bedside lights--we like to read when going to bed, and we moved a desk lamp over for one side of the bed, and asked for another lamp for the other side of the bed, but they were unable to come up with one. This seems like a basic amenity in a hotel of this quality, and it was a disappointment.",3.0,3
"Nice room, so-so staff
While we were there recently, the hotel had some landscape work done outside. The landscape company used a large blower to fill a large planter outside the front doors of the hotel. The soil they used was filled with a very foul smelling fertilizer that filled not only the hotel's lobby, but also every floor of the hotel. Not one concession was offered by the hotel staff when complaints were made. Even a drink or meal on the house would have sufficed. The staff was indifferent.
Also, one of the concierge staff was -- well, snooty. My goodness! Really? 
Be prepared to pay for internet service anywhere in the hotel -- $12.95 a day. Cheaper hotels offer wifi for free. What gives?
We paid a high price for a special stay in downtown Seattle. We had a great time downtown, but was not impressed with our Renaissance experience.",3.0,3
"OK for the price paid.....
The Herald Square Hotel is centrally located when you want to visit Midtown Manhattan. The Empire State Building- Madison Square Garden - Macy, 5th Ave. etc... are very close by. The beds at the Herald Square Hotel are very comfy and clean. The hotel also provides free WI FI to all guests and a coffee/tea maker is located in the reception area.
The hotel needs remodeling. Every night the water pipes and heating system woke me up due to a ""hammering"" noise that kept on for some time. The carpet in the room (dark greenish color) made my freshly washed white socks black and needs to be changed. Very little storage possibilities - as a party of 2 adult women we needed some storage space - the little wardrobe (which contained the ironing board and the iron) didn't give much and the drawers in the sideboard were so dirty I wouldn't leave anything in there. I don't like living out of my suitcase even if it it only for a couple of days. Poor decoration, the rooms are not very cosy. Instead of the huge flatscreen, curtains and some wall decoration would be more inviting. No blowdryer or any other amenities in the bathroom - had to go to the reception to borrow one.",3.0,3

"Unimpressive
The only good thing about this hotel is the location (if you are taking a cruise). 
My family and I booked two hotel rooms about a month and a half before our staying to make sure we would be next to each other. When we got to the hotel we were given rooms that were 5 floors apart from one another so we went to the desk and asked for rooms next to one another as we had booked. The woman at the desk, with attitude, gave us our rooms on completely opposite sides of the building. 
Additionally, we booked ocean view rooms for a little under $300.00 a night. One of the rooms had a view of a railroad that went behind the hotel at all hours of the night and made a TON of noise, a bridge, and if you leaned up against the window and looked to your right you could see the water. For $300.00 a night! When we asked for a new room the woman at the desk said they couldn't help that there was a train and that's the only ""ocean view"" they had left with no apology, compensation, nothing. 
My aunt, uncle and cousins stayed at the Westin that gave great service and was more luxurious for a better price. I will definitely be staying there or ANYWHERE else next time I go.",2.0,2
"Worst service ever!
I came back 5 days ago but I am still shocked about my experience at Georgetown Suites. I have been staying there for 16 nights, during which I had to face various problems. For instance, I had to move twice to a different room: the first one was at my own request since the 20 years old fridge was incredibly noisy, even causing vibration to the wall (and I am not difficult with noise in general, the best example is that I was able to sleep with the noisy Air conditioner...). The second time was due to a leakage right next to my bed (from the roof, due to rain). Although I asked them to fix it several times, I had no answer (and wet mouldy towel) for three days. They just proposed me to move to another room another day of rain (and of course, I had to move everything by myself). But these are basically details that just made me slept bad for few nights. But what is still very present in my mind is the rudeness of the personnel at the desk front. Actually, most of them were just careless and only give you the impression to be annoying. But one of the employees has made my stay particularly terrible: I am not sure what her problem was with me, but I have been feeling insulted and unwelcomed in many occasions. When I left and said goodbye, her last words for me were ‘I don’t say goodbye when I don’t mean it’. This was just unbelievable. Her reaction could be understandable if I had been a thought complainer, but I am not a difficult guest, and during this stay, I have only complained about ‘concrete’ problems, and always respectfully. I am travelling a lot for work, but this had been my worst experience ever. 
Other negative points: outdated room and cleaning service not good (lipstick on the glass, dust, etc.)
Positive: good size room, central location, next to shops, restaurants and buses

"Great Location, but why do they still charge for room wifi?
The location of this Marriott is unbeatable for exploring the very lower tip of Manhattan. There is so much to see here, most notably the new World Trade Center, the Memorial, and all the historic early New York locales such as Wall Street, South Street Seaport, Bowling Green Park, Trinity Church...the list really does go on and on. Subway lines all come through the area in one place or another and you can walk the fabulous Brooklyn Bridge to see more stuff across the river. The Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island tours depart from Battery Park where street artists perform while you wait. With so many new residential buildings going up, the restaurant scene is also vibrant.
The hotel itself is everything you would expect from a Marriott: comfortable beds, clean rooms, great views. My only criticism, but it's a big one, is the charge of $12.95 a day for internet access in the guest rooms. Granted, the first floor of the hotel has free wi-fi, which is evident by all the people sitting with their laptops in the lobby seating area. But who wants to sit in a crowded lobby just to check your emails or flight status, when you could do it in the privacy of your own room, like so many other millions of hotels? It's on the higher end of the Marriott tiers of classifying their hotels, so they are already charging more for the rooms. Why nickel and dime us on the wi-fi?",4.0,4

We stayed at the Arizona Grand Resort over Spring Break. Great room, very clean property, excellent gym, great food at the on-site restaurants. 
My biggest disappointment was the Water Park was handled. It was extremely crowded in the afternoon and if you didn't stand in line at the beginning of the morning to grab a chair, you were out of luck if you wanted to go in the afternoon. To make matters worse, although the resort boasts they have 7 pools, again finding a chair in the afternoon is very difficult because people just put their towels on the chairs and then leave to go to other things. Since you pay an additional daily ""resort fee"" I feel like you should at least be able to find a chair at the water park or the pool.",4.0,4
"Disappointed but Great Location
We were disappointed in this hotel and expected more. This is a big and beautiful hotel in a georgeous location but we were unable to borrow a cart to move our luggage from the car to the room. The Hilton only had one cart for th entire hotel? The coffee in the room was awful. The room was comfortable and the exercise room was nice. There was free fruit in the exercise room in the morning. The only other issue was $24 to park and the first few levels were reserved spaces which were mostly empty. Everything is very expensive - over valued in my opinion. The room had one bottle of $4 water - really?????",3.0,3
"Location, Location, Location
We recently enjoyed a four night stay at The Chancellor Hotel at the end of a 14 day road trip around California. The hotel is an older property with some period features particularly apparent in the lobby area, and certain parts of the hotel show signs of dating. But I am not saying that this was a cause for complaint as we received very helpful and friendly service from all members of staff, our rooms were very comfortable and clean and we were fortunate enough to have excellent views across Union Square. The location of the hotel is its strength as we found it was perfect for getting around San Francisco and having taken a tour bus around SF we were pleased that this was definitely in one of the safer areas. Most of the attractions are within walking distance and if you purchase the passes for the cable cars / trams / buses you can hop on and off wherever you like. My only suggestion to the hotel is that you should think about increasing the size and updating the image of the hotel bar. It seemed a popular meeting place but far too small to accommodate the clientele. We enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and our stay at the Chancellor but I didn't ""leave my heart there"" .... I am sure the city is trying to help the homeless and down and outs, but they appear to have a long way to go.",4.0,4
"Quaint and homey, yet has a real old Broadway and Television Star feel.
I felt like I was staying in the lap of luxury, because of the fine treatment by the staff and the feeling I got ,from the decorations and decor, that many stars of Broadway and Television had stayed there. Being from central Illinois and being over 60 years old, and being in NY for the first time, I was in awe of the feel of old Hollywood or Broadway in the lobby, the hallways and the room we stayed in. I don't think the price was bad for the comfort of the room. Yes, it was small, but we didn't need a lot of room to sleep, and that is about all we did there.....I LOVE NEW YORK. The location is excellent! Even my old legs could easily make it to most of the attractions in the area and there is bicycle rental next door and a cathedral across the street and TWO theaters in the same block. 
We stayed two nights in room 205 with King bed (very comfy bed). Free Internet too. Iron and ironing board in the room and a safe located behind a beautiful wall desk/ cabinet. Large bathroom and a bathtub big enough to soak in, so bring your bubblebath ladies! 
Can't comment on the elevator, as we used the stairs. The carpet does need to be replaced in the lobby and the hallways, but the room was clean and bright. I wish the owner would consider opening the restaurant area, at least for coffee and drinks.
I will recommend the Mayfair to anyone who likes atmosphere over chrome and glaring lights.
BTW, don't forget to tip the staff! They don't ask for it, but they are so nice and they deserve it.",5.0,5
"School friendly absolutely
We took 20 students to the Baymont Inn and Suites in Dallas and found the staff to be most friendly and helpful. We were met with fresh baked cookies. Our every need was met with promptness and professionalism. I could not have asked for a better experience for my students.

"Convenient Starwoods property with a great staff.
This hotel is nice. We just returned from a wedding reception here and stayed a couple of nights. It's not glamorous L.A. but perfectly adequate. Jayson Portman who checked us in at the front desk was probably the best employee at any Sheraton we have stayed, we are Starwood members, so we stay frequently at Sheraton properties. His service was impeccable and efficient. The room was ready and he gave us our choice of rooms for an early check-in. The breakfast brunch included oatmeal, omelets, sausage, bacon ,fruit, as well as continental offerrings. Valet service efficient, and walk to Universal Studios was short- just across the bridge.",4.0,4
"Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn is the Best Place to Stay!
Once again we stayed at the Beverly Garland for our trip to LA to see Billy Elliott. The hotel is so conveniently located and we love the service and the friendly staff. Our room was spacious and clean and we enjoyed eating lunch poolside with friends. I also love that they have a gym, a laundry facility and a movie theatre! It is the best hotel for the money anywhere in LA! I forgot to mention the pillows. We had 4 pillows clearly marked as Hard and Soft. How great!",5.0,5
"Avoid!
The place is in a good location, and that is the last positive thing I will say about this dump. First you walk into the decor of Atlantic City 1993. Old, horrid decor, carpeting and design. If it is any indication the restaurant (That I wouldn't dare try) has blue water glasses on the tables. The rooms are worse. Time for a serious update! Besides that the bed and bedding. My wife and I both found the beds were awful! We both had back and neck issues for days after sleeping on them. If you have to stay here, bring an air mattress and use that. Also, I found it hard to sleep due to sever allergies. I found that strange, because outside I was fine, but when I got to the room my allergies acted up terribly. I investigated, and found dust on ledges, pictures, and giant clump of lint in the out blowing air ducts. There was a disgusting brown stain behind the toilets in the bathroom. Just filthy! When I brought it to a managers attention, he asked, ""Would you like us to fix that?"" I was in shock. Yes, I would like you to fix the feces stains, and unbreathable air in my room, if it's not too much trouble. The place is a dump, management is rude and clueless, old furnishings and appointments, and overall one of the worst hotels Ive had the displeasure of staying in. Never again Omni.",1.0,1
"Not so bad as many say. Absolutely great location.
This hotel is for young people and tourists without great expectations. The hotel was built in 1901. The rooms are small with 100 years of history. So don’t be surprised by ghosts playing with your ceiling lamp :)) I was lucky to have none of them or they were just friendly not to scare me out of wits. Having spent about 25-30 minutes in a queue finally I got keys from my room. The girl at the reception told me I was privileged to get a superior room instead of standard one. God, if this poor room was a superior, I’m sorry for those who had Standard. The long labyrinth of corridors and finally the door with a historical plate would be a shock for every girl travelling alone. The windows faced inner court so there was no view of the street. My room had a shower, a wardrobe with 6 hangers. There was a space between the windows and the frame and cold air easily came into my room so I had to keep the heavy thick curtains shut constantly even during the day time and turn on the heater to maximum. At the end of my journey I felt myself like a vampire scared of coming to day light. The bathroom was small. The shower had curtains and no slide doors so I had to wash myself carefully to prevent the flood. The bed was big and comfortable. And I spent some great time watching TV with big number of channels. My room had a small fridge where I used to store some food for a night bite. However to my surprise there was a lonely sandwich left by the previous guest which I found inside on the second day of my stay. Some people say the fridge was not to be used for free (10$ per day). Mine was free. I even asked if it was free at the reception desk on arrival. They looked at me as I was a bit crazy. :)) Once in two days I encouraged the maid with 2-dollar tips. And my room became nice and clean. The shampoo, the hair conditioner, the soap and mouth wash were added on daily basis. On arrival the girl at the reception took a deposit of 40 dollars. I paid it in cash (otherwise it would be blocked for month on the credit card). The cash deposit was given me back on departure. I would also recommend thinking in advance about the socket adapter. I took one from Moscow. But many people experienced difficulties to find it in stores or borrow at the hotel. The hotel is huge indeed. So do not expect great service. I saw many irritated people around arguing with the staff. The staff had cold and blank faces. The wifi is not for free. I never used it in a hotel. If you need free wifi just go to any Starbucks café. The best thing about this hotel is location. Easy to get from and to the JFK airport. The shuttle bus stops just 20 meters from the hotel. The price is only 15 dollars each way. Can be booked on the shuttle company website or you can pay right in a bus. If you decide to use this shuttle just ask the ground transportation service desk on arrival. They will ask you the name of your hotel and give you a small note with the bus number. I was called by my driver in about 10 minutes. The bus has several stops between airport terminals to pick up/drop off every pax. It also has several stops at Manhattan. It took me about 1 hour to get each way (from airport to Manhattan and from Manhattan to JFK airport). Mind the traffic. It would take even longer in rush hours. The famous Macy’s is right behind the corner. The Metro station is near and you can easily find your way to Century 21th. The Broad way and Empire State building just a few minutes walk. If you are hungry and prefer to bite in a room, take it left from the hotel and go to the Fresh and Co. There is a choice of up to 8 soups a day. The large portion is 8 dollars. They give you free bread and wrap it to take away. My favorite was Crème soup with turkey. If you would love to have not only salads or soups then take it to the right from hotel in direction of Macy’s. Pass Sbarro and Macdonald’s and enter a small take away restaurant. There is a variety of hot meals and starters for 7 dollars per 1 pound (approx. 500 grams). Quite delicious and good alternative. Anyway Don't stay in this hotel for your honey moon. EVEN if you are tempted with it's great location and in love with camping style of accomodations. This honey moon will end in 5 minutes after you will enter the room. :)) Not for romance for sure.",3.0,3
"Not so great hotel in a not so great area
I agree with an earlier review, customer service great, hotel not. Also would never recommend anyone walk alone in the surrounding area. Purchased on Hotwire with the hotel name unseen but hotel given three stars. Someone is deceiving someone -- two stars would be generous. Standard cheap hotel fare in a not-so-good part of downtown Indianapolis.",2.0,2
"Just average. Okay.
I was in Austin for business. First, getting to and from this hotel is a pain. It is hard to find and very complicated due to limited access to the property from the service road that runs alongside the freeway.
The room was okay. Internet was crappy. I was actually blocked by the 3rd party service for using too much bandwidth. Hotel staff could not figure out what was going on. I had to call the internet service. Took nearly an hour. They finally told me I was streaming too many movies. Really? I watched 4 or 5 clips on YouTube posted by a family member. Ridiculous.
The micro-fridge unit was noisy. One phone did not work. Never had a chance to try out the restaurant, but the place looked very spartan. After looking at the restaurant, we decided to go out for breakfast on the one morning we did not have business meetings.
While I did not partake, people really liked the morning coffee bar, complete with gournet syrups and whipped cream. I just had a cup of coffee, and it was rather bland.
The fitness room was the worst. No airflow. Unable to control temperature. Could not use the eliptical because my head kept pushing though the ceiling tiles! The tv did not work. No wipes to clean off/sanitize equipment. I ended up using the treadmill, but I could not increase the incline above 2.5 due to the low ceiling.
Will say that the front desk staff were wonderful and helpful. Very nice. Also, the sports bar in the rear of the hotel made one of the best hamburgers I have ever tasted.
Finally, Holiday Inn, what's with the little pillows? There were four pillows on the bed, two soft and two hard. But the pillows are more like throw pillows, not typical bed pillows. I don't get it.",3.0,3

"First and last time to stay in a Westin.
Let me begin by saying I am a Starwood loyalist. I am a seasoned traveler. I stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago and hoped the bad experience might soften before I wrote the review. But whenever I think of that hotel, I think about my lovely relaxing get away from New York, as ruined by this experience. I went the weekend AFTER the SuperBowl, so you would think Westin property a few blocks from the stadium would have it's act together. Also the fact that this is a HUGE convention hotel. OK, convention hotels are not always the swankiest, but usually very service oriented. This one gets zero circles for service.
 First I had a rental car. When I pulled up at about 11 p.m., there was no valet/bellman/doorman who came out. I waited awhile and even honked my horn. It was a snowy night and I was nursing a broken ankle. After about 10 minutes, I had no choice but to lock up the care and hobble in. They said they only had one bellman on duty and he was helping someone else. One guy at the front desk also helping someone else. I was given a room with a burned out light in the bathroom. So I called downstairs. They couldn't tell me when maintainence would come up, so I asked if I could just change rooms, since I hadn't even unzipped my suitcase. So it took a while, but they come up with a key for a new room and floor. It was fine. As I started unpacking, I heard a lot of noise in the hallway. I waited about 15 minutes and it seemed to grow more. It was now midnight. I opened the door and I saw kids sitting in the hallway and drinking...show no signs of leaving. I said how much longer are you going to be out there, and they just looked at me. I called downstairs and asked if they could intervene. They said, Well a fraternity has booked the hotel, so there is not much we can do. I said, OK, do you have any floors without a fraternity party going on? They said they would move me. So I waited. and waited. I called down and they said the bellman was on his way. He never came after about 15 minutes. Back downstairs and the poor front desk guy, still alone, helping others. At this point, I am distraught. Bad ankle, tired from a long flight, and hungry. He put me in a room he said ""where the pilots and flight attendants stay."" The poor alone bellman tries to help me move. He was very sweet, but I said, it seems only three people are working tonight, you, the front desk, and the guy on the phone. And he said, pretty much. I couldn't believe it...the hotel is huge and they were nearly booked as it was the weekend before Valentine's Day. I got to the room, it was fine, no view, but it was quiet. I unpacked and called room service, nearly 1 a.m. now (wasted all this time getting to a decent, quiet room). They only had a few items to offer...nothing hot. And really cheap wines (well, I could see I am not at the W!). I asked how long it would take and they said 45 minutes. So it would be nearing 2 a.m.. It was near 0 outside, so they sent me to the attached restaurant, which was nice enough,and they were closing up, but took pity on me and had some bar food which was hot which I carried up to my room (very glamorous!) 
I then went to take a shower and the ""heavenly shower heads""...only one worked so it was not so heavenly. The bathroom was smaller than most in New York and the lighting was very dim. The towels were super thin (definitely not heavenly), and there were only one bath towel! Then went to sleep in the so-called heavenly beds, which felt just like any old hotel bed. Nothing special about the linens either. The next morning, I went to use the phone by the bed, and it did not work. Had to get up and go over to the desk. I called down to ask for a manager to share my experience and see if I could get these items fixed while I went out for the day. They said they don't have a manager until 1. I said ok, can I leave a message for him? I was doubtful that they took the message, I went to the front desk on my way out (there is no concierge at this hotel)....again waiting in line, although there were now 2 people at the front desk. I told my person a little bit of my story, and she was very rude. I left my number again with her for the manager to call me on my mobile So, the entire day, no one called me. I got back to the room thinking there was a message, and again,none. The shower was not fixed, nor was the phone. The sheets were not changed. Even though I put the little card on the bed that said ""change the sheets."" When I left the hotel, I will say there were a few more people at the bell/valet stand than at night. But when I stop to ask them for the best directions to the location (only about 7 miles!), it was if I had asked them how to get to Memphis. They totally could not give me directions...didn't seem to know the streets at all. Very odd. They asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, and I just laughed and left, using my Google map on my cell phone...difficult to use as the roads were slick. When I returned late at night, I experienced the same problem with no bellman/valet. Had to turn the car off and come in. Same thing at the front desk...one lone guy. Well only one more night of this. When I checked out I stopped by the front desk just to be sure they had my entire bill, including valet (which incidentally they did not as I was charged for that a few days later). Again a very cold staff at the reception desk. This is not the Indy I remembered. I finally said, are you interested in my Westin experience at your hotel? The woman seemed a little shocked. She asked if I wanted to speak with a manager. I said yes, but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to DURING my stay, not as I am checking out. I left my cell phone number if they were interested in my experience. I will tell all who read this review to beware of this hotel. It really gave me a poor view of downtown Indianapolis after all the hype. As far as staying in a Westin...never. To all who may be forced to stay here, just know this is a very old property with some renovation in public areas. The rooms are clean enough, but very dated. Bathroom is so dimly lit, you need to put on your makeup in the bedroom (so bring some extensionn cords). In terms of my rating, if there were an option for no circles, that would no circles too many.",1.0,1
"Hotel from hell
Upon arriving and being appaled by having to deposit $50.00 cash a guest came to the counter cryin loudly and asking for help because she had been ""robbed at knife-point"". The clerk was not at all helpful--just gave me the key to the room and told me where it was located. Walking down the hall it was not hard to see the carpet had not been cleaned in a least a year. Stains everywhere and the smell of filth. The wallpaper in the room was coming off but the bed and linens were clean. We spent two nights but did not rest because of screaming yelling outside our window and we felt very usafe and insecure. Also, the first morning we noticed a big sign on the elevator dooe ""OUT OF ORDER"" Breakfast was the pits and if I couldn't cook better than that I would not even try to call it a breakffast. There was scrambled eggs that smelled rotten and day old donuts and bread. The toaster for the bread worked so well it toasted one side at a time if you were lucky! Forget it--Dennys is 1 mile away! I do not know who will read this but I recommend you stay anywhere but here. Good day!!",1.0,1
"Great Potential... Under Construction
I stayed here over the weekend. This was previously a Helmsley hotel which is now going through a complete modernization. All the rooms are brand new and they are definitely up to Westin standards. The location in midtown is great! Unfortunately due to the construction, there is no lounge, restaurant or lobby that is open - except breakfast in the lobby restaurant and room service. There is no concierge lounge which I found surprising for a major hotel chain in NYC. This makes it basically a hotel with very nice rooms, but no NY vibe at all. I did use the new gym which is very large and well equiped. The concierge staff were excellent and all their recommendations were terrific. The room rate was competitive with other hotels of this caliber that were completely open and that is the rub. I did not hear any construction noise and there was no sign of the actual construction site, so it didn't feel like you were in a work zone. I would inquire before booking to make sure this meets your expectations.",3.0,3
"Excellent location, renovated property, but a little noisy
Stayed here for a weekend racing event. Hotel is perfectly situated as it's only minutes away from Fisherman's Warf. The property appears to have been recently renovated with updated, tasteful decor and all the things a leisure or business traveler would need. The staff was also very professional, friendly and helpful. The only downside was the noise. This hotel needs to consider installing dual-pane windows. My room faced North Point street and the noise from the idling tour buses, rowdy tourists and overall traffic made it difficult to get a good night's sleep. Had i known this, I would have definitely requested an interior (courtyard-view) room. Otherwise, it's a great place and a good value.",4.0,4

"Great Downtown Location & Service...Not Much Else
Stayed here for a business trip in Jan. 2012. Location was great, within easy walking distance to conference center, restaraunts, Alamo, etc. The service was great as well; I forgot my phone charger, and without hesitation, one of the desk attendents let me borrow his for the week I was there. My room was ok, nothing spectacular. This hotel is definitley historic (older). My room faced the road from the third floor and every morning the single pane, wooden windows made it sound as if traffic was IN my room, noisey. Not much to their breakfast. I would recommend this hotel for its location and if you only plan to be in it for a few hours each day/night to sleep, then leave again the next morning. I'd try other hotels with downtown locations first....but don't exclude this one from the list.",3.0,3
"A Pleasant Surprise
I found the Renaissance to be a great hotel when you need a place near the airport. Other reviews say the hotel is outdated, but the 3rd floor conference room our group was in was just renovated and brand new, even the restrooms were very contemporary. The food at The Sanctuary was better than I expected. Over the course of several days I had crab cakes, and a breakfast, and onion soup and it was all good. So was the cocktail lounge. The staff was so helpful and courteous, and my room was very comfy and had everything I needed. It was quiet too, except for the night I arrived. Unknown to me, Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was in Philly & staying at this hotel, and the place was buzzing with reporters, his team, and secret service people. Once the excitement from that died down, the place was quiet. If I had to go back to this area for business, I'd go back. By the way, it's about a 20-25 minute drive to downtown or the Rittenhouse Square area.",4.0,4
"Never, Never, Never, Again!!!
If you want to be treated like a criminal when you've been traveling all day and just need an old pillow to sleep on... don't even check into this dump. Unfortunately, the owners of this place know they have a location that fills them up anyway and these reviews probably do not matter to them.
The ""I don't know what to call her help"" at the front desk is mean, abrasive, and useless. The rooms are miserable, dark, and uncomfortable. The bath towels are for infants along with a dribbling shower head that can barely wash a hand.

They have many automatic chemical sprayers above each elevator door to overcome the musty/mildew smell. The management promissed to change my room in the evening and when I came back they said I missed the switch by a couple of hours and that they are booked.

My wife and recently stayed @ The Helmsley Park Lane. While it had a beautiful view of Central Park we were very disappointed with the room, which was in serious need of upgrading. The furniture was tattered and torn as well as weak and broken table legs on the table closest to the window. The first thing I noticed was in the bathroom which had extremly thick paint on the door hinges and rust so bad it was flaking off. We stayed there because of their winter special 50% off the room rate and free continetnal breakfast, which was not as good as you could find at a more affordable chain hotel. Back to the room, one would expect in a hotel of this caliber you would find fine linens, oh but not here very cheap sheets and rough towels.In room coffee would have been nice, bit then again when you charge eleven dolloars for a small pot of coffee through room service why offer it for free.

My family and I have stayed here several times in the last two years, en route to other destinations. Our most recent stay was in January 2012.

The hotel's rooms are lovely and clean, and the decor is a nice change from standard hotel decor -- much lighter and airier. The customer service is first rate. It is also very pet friendly, with what I consider to be a reasonable extra fee for accommodating your pet. There are also plenty of walkways in the area for dog walking. Our corgi loves it!

I lived in San Diego for 11 years and moved up to Northern California a year ago. My boyfriend and I decided it was time to go back for a little mini vacation and to visit friends.

Enrico and the rest of the front desk staff were AMAZING!! I have been in the hospitality business for 15 years and this was BY FAR the BEST hotel experience I've had. They made us feel welcome and at home. Katherine the concierge was wonderful as well, even though we weren't the typical tourist (zoo, seaworld, etc...) she was determined to help out how ever she could.

"Thought we'd give it another try, but. . .
My husband and I decided we'd try the Westin-Charlotte again, as we wanted a hotel convenient to the uptown. Unfortunately, once again we arrived to find the check-in desk poorly staffed, no one behind the Starwood Preferred desk (as was our experience on our last visit). It also sounded like the check-in staff were handling questions which sounded like ""concierge-type"" questions (of course, there was no one behind the concierge desk either). As we were finally checking in, I noticed all of the computer keyboards for check-in looked as though they were sitting on shoeboxes which had been wrapped in black paper which was torn and frayed. Not a good first impression to be sure.
When arriving in our room (which was on the Starwood Preferred floor), we noticed there was about a half inch of water in the tub (which was stained) due to the dripping faucet. 
We have stayed in a number of Westin hotels across the country, and this one is certainly NOT up to standard. Will probably not be giving it a 3rd try.",2.0,2

First of all, the hotel itself: rooms, facilities, staff, etc, are fine. Have stayed here twice. Unfortunately, perhaps because of the location, or the groups they book, they attract an ethnic and LOUD clientele. Lots of socializing, yelling, and door slamming in the halls, ALL night long. 
Won't be back, prefer to sleep at night.",2.0,2
"Unimpressed
We stayed at the Standard recently and were very disappointed. The hallways are dark and creepy. The rooftop pool was murky. Hated the design of the room. Stark and uncomfortable. Trying too hard to be trendy. Pretentious. I would not stay there again.",2.0,2

"Excellent hotel
My husband and I stayed here for a night after a long flight from Australia via Los Angeles. We booked the room through Expedia and got a great deal. The hotel room was one of the nicest I've ever stayed in, and it and the bathroom were both enormous. Our king bed was lovely and comfortable, so much so that we ended up sleeping for 11 hours! Room service was prompt and tasty - we had a pizza and a cheeseburger. We also had a late breakfast downstairs the following morning, and it was reasonably priced and delicious. All of the staff from check in, room service and the restaurant were helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, not just because of its convenient location to the airport but because it's an excellent hotel.",5.0,5
"HOTEL PENNSYL - SKEEVE - IA. EEEUUUW. BRING BLEACH.
HOTEL PENNSYL - SKEEVE - IA. EEEUUUW. BRING BLEACH.
I am horrified just thinking about the moment I opened the door to 1105.
First thing I noticed was the shabby dirty rugs. OMG I have to buy flip flops a the .99 store around the corner.
Next ,the gross fresh ""dirt?"" stain that was on the bedspread.
OK... we took the spread off inside out, folded it over and over until it was long and thin like a rug runner and placed it on the floor in front of the bed to walk on.
The AC did not work and the window did not open.
Determined, I stood an a chair and forced the top sash to slide down so the air could kill the disgusting cheap smell of air freshener they drenched my room in to hide the odors.
But wait it gets worse.
THE BATHROOM still had the tub and sink from the 40's. Tub had the porcelain finish worn off, the tiles were filthy, the grout was black.
I moved the tiny bar of soap in the tubs soap dish and lo and behold the first hair.
THAT WAS IT!!
My cousin down the block who lives in NYC had to come over with a mop and a spray bottle of bleach and she sprayed the bathroom from ceiling to floor.
10 more hairs later.....she was scrapping some kind of gradue off the tiles by the toilet that was caked on near the floor.
The toilet seat was all chipped and worn and there were NO bath towels until we called for some.
The continental breakfast had no cereal or fruit like most hotels we stay at, just bagels and buns.
We walked right out.
We bought a movie and when we stopped it to take a break we were not allowed to fast forward or rewind!!???
Yes, it is the cheapest hotel in town, $150 cheaper and for a good reason.
Pay extra and sleep without worry about bedbugs, rats and ghosts of guests past who probably contracted some rare virus in their rooms and have died in this pig sty.
MAYBE RIGHT IN THE SAME BED YOU ARE SLEEPING ON!!!!",1.0,1
"Charming Stay
My husband and I stayed at The Inn at The Black Olive 2/16/12, and absolutely loved it. This is such a charming, quiet, and very clean hotel. The room was beautifully decorated with local art and live plants. The bed was extremely comfortable in a spacious bedroom, separate from the living and dining area. We appreciated the free bottle of Greek wine and eco-friendly toiletries. The market has scrumptious fresh baked bread and Greek olive oil, not to mention awesome coffee with organic creamer. Staff were exceptionally polite, helpful, and professional. We have plans to come back very soon!",5.0,5
"Excellent Location for visiting UCLA but too expensive for what you get
Very clean rooms decorated with antique furniture (in the positive sense); our beds were superb and soft - no plywood as mentioned before. Strange how different experiences can be. The brekafast was very good but somehow odd because there are no proper tables to eat - either you sit on a sofa with your plate on the knees or you take the food to your room. Staff at the reception were not especially friendly. Actually the cleaning staff were more friendly and cheerful. Big plus point is the parking garage with direct elevator access to the room floors. Neverthelles, the place is too expensive for what you get - at the end it is a guesthouse and not a 4 star hotel.We will go somewhere else next time. The best of the hotel are the pictures hanging at the walls showing old scenes from Westwood and UCLA.",3.0,3

The kids love the pool and as parents we loved the managers reception, which had snacks for the kids and adult beverages for us. It is very close to the subway and exceptionally clean. We had the 1 bedroom suite that accommodated everyone. The free breakfast was better then a restaurant breakfast buffet. I cannot say enough about this hotel and whenever we visit again, this is where we will stay without a doubt!!!!!!!!",5.0,5
"Thanksgiving Stay Just OK
This hotel is huge! There is something to be said for smaller hotels and service. I felt very lost in the busy shuffle and found the service to be awful. I am well aware of the cost in NYC and it being high, but to couple pricy for poor service is frustrating. I found the staff at the front desk to be very defensive and hassled. The staff at Crossroads (the restaurant) was very slow in service and rude when inquiring. Keep in mind, the cost for one egg white was nearly $14.
As a reward member, who has stayed in a lot of Marriott's, this by far is the worst visit. All in all, look elsewhere.",2.0,2
"Good value but not 'all that'
The lobby and rooms are clean, chic and lovely, and we found an attentive staff who promptly delivered extra pillows, ironing board and iron and gave us a free box of cashews when the ones we opened from the honor bar proved stale. Our only real objection was a very small room with no room for an ironing board to begin with, queen, not king size bed, tiny closet and no place to put your luggage so it has to be opened on the floor. Sound transference between rooms was also a problem along with door slamming in halls. On balance this was a good value b/c we paid under $200 on Hotwire, but I would have been bummed if I'd paid full freight.",3.0,3
"Great location, not-so-great hotel
Overall, not a bad hotel - 
Positives : clean room, comfortable beds, nice shower. AC works great and the location is fantastic.
Negatives : lobby/valet under construction which makes for loud noises during the day. The worst part of the hotel is the elevators - they seriously made us miserable during the stay. It took an average of 5 minutes to get an elevator - always big lines in the lobby, and then it took 4 minutes on average to get to the 20th floor. Very slow. 
The price is nice, but I would hesitate to stay here again mostly because of the elevators.",3.0,3
"Best Decision
This was my first visit to New York and was having trouble deciding where to stay. Found this one and was thebest decision for the holiday. Its in a perfect location as it is close and within walking distance to Madison Square Garden, Times Square, good restaurants and great shopping. Very nice staff and the Tick Tock diner was great. Service was always good and the room was kept nice and clean. The only bad thing was the bed's were quite short but other than that I cant complain about the hotel in anyway. I definately will recommend this hotel to anyone I know that is going to New York in the future.",5.0,5
"Sadly, not good.
Yes the location is great. But there are many other hotels in the area for the same price that I've stayed at that are MUCH nicer. I was very disappointed with my stay at the paramount.
The internet would just drop every couple of hours. I had to call their tech support and talk to them for an hour until the wireless was 'fixed'. And the kicker; the wifi is $13.00 a day. WTH?
They're going through renovations so that's great, but the rooms that haven't been renovated yet are disgusting. Paint chipping off the ceiling. Disgusting bathroom to say the least.
The weird thing is there isn't ANYWHERE to set things down. No table or desk.
Hall way areas are not well lit. Room walls are paper thin.
The fire alarm went off during my stay. 
Do yourself a favor and check out other hotels.",1.0,1

Did not realize his hotel was under construction or would not have stayed here.

Floors that are being renovated should be closed. Room was okay but not the location due to construction. Manager did refund some points but not nearly enough to cover the number of points required for this room.",2.0,2
"Hard Hotel to Rate
I have stayed at The Quincy a number of times. Many of the other reviewers already covered key points: good location; large room; climate control is very limited, so there is a chance you will be too hot or too cold; there is quite a bit of noise (whether you stay in the front or back side of the hotel); and some aspects of the hotel and rooms are dated.
I will address a slightly different issue. The last two times I stayed here I had problems with my reservation, which I made on the Quincy website. The first time I showed up about 10 PM, tired and ready to get some sleep. When I tried to check in the woman told me they didn't have a reservation for me. I pulled out a printout of my confirmation and handed it to the woman. The story then changed to someone canceled my reservation. I asked who did that and when. She said a member of the staff had canceled my reservation. There was no explanation as to why. She then proceeded to tell me the hotel was sold out and there was nothing she could do. She actually expected me to just take my luggage and leave. When I refused to do so, she finally agreed to call another hotel and try to find me a room. She got me a room at the Washington Suites, which is about 1/2 mile away. The hotel did not offer to provide a cab, but she was happy to tell me how to walk there.
As a result of that experience, I avoided The Quincy for a while. But recently I decided to give it another try. I made my resrvation on the Quincy website. When I tried to check in around noon, I was told they did not have a reservation for me. I again pulled out a printed copy of my reservation and handed it to the woman. She again said she did not see a reservation for me. The woman then took my printed confirmation and disappeared in a back room for about 10 minutes. When she came out she said they worked out the issue. She said the hotel had two reservation systems but she only had access to one at the front desk. Someone in the back room was able to finally find it on their supposed other system. It sounded like a lot of bull to me.
They told me they did not have any rooms available at that time and said I should come back. I was not leaving anything to chance. I was attending a meeting close to the hotel. At 2 PM I actually walked out of my meeting to go back to the hotel to check in, just to make sure I got a room.
One other tidbit of info, the hotel haa a quasi frequent stayer club called the Q Club. If you are a member, which I am, you are supposed to get breakfast and a discount on the room. I have never gotten breakfast. Also, if you make a reservation on the hotel website, there are no instructions on how to get your Q Club discount. The hotel will be happy to explain the process to you once you get there, but then you are expected to remember it.
This hotel happenes to be convenient to where I often do business in DC, which is why I use it. But with all the other hotels in DC and the experience I have had here (including the noise and heat issues), it is questionable if I would go back.",2.0,2
"Friendly staff made this a great trip!
I was at conference in Boston during the transformer fire where the majority of the area was without power.

"good option in expensive san francisco
San Francisco is an expensive city by world standards for hotels.Hotel Boheme is a good option but be ready for european standards. The location is great being half way between downtown city shops and the wharf area ( basically on the top of a hill). Eating in surrounding areas is excelent with Italian and Asian food. This is a small hotel with few facilities just like typical Paris.The rooms are small and access is via rather narrow curving stairs. No good if you are infirm or disabled. We had a back room so little street noise but instead we had the noise and smell from the restuarant fans so could not open the windows. Old TV took up room when a small digital fitted to the wall would have been so much better. They kept our bags for us until our afterrnoon flight even although they have little storage space.",3.0,3
"Very Basic
This was the most expensive of the four hotels we stayed in on our recent trip to the USA. It was also by far the worst. From the moment we entered the reception area we had a sinking feeling. Our fears were realised when we opened the door to our room. It was so small that only one person could move around at once and the other person had to put their legs on the bed so the other one could get by. There was a broken venetian blind covering the window. This had to be kept closed all the time as there were other rooms immediately opposite (see photo). The beds were only about a foot apart. The wardrobe was very small and there were no drawers. There were no coffee making facilities and no room safe. Neither were safety deposit facilities available at reception, meaning we had to carry all our valuables round with us. Even though we were five floors up we could hear the noise of the subway trains all the time. The best part of our room was the bathroom, which was quite large by comparison, though the towels were rather threadbare. The room was very stuffy but the air con made a terrible noise. As mentioned in previous reviews, the lift was very small and we often waited 5 mins for it to arrive.
The hotel is a long way from the centre of Manhattan, necessitating a subway or taxi ride.
There is a deli nearby which serves a reasonable breakfast, and also a bar 3 blocks away. There is also an excellent supermarket opposite the bar.
The only saving grace about this hotel was that the beds and towels were clean, or we would not have stayed there.",2.0,2

I had figured I could use my daughter's shower if the shared bath was a problem, but the bathroom across the hall from my room was clean and there was plenty of hot water. Front desk staff was efficient and responsive, and the door men were very helpful and friendly. While I didn't make use of the communal areas, there seemed to be plenty of people hanging out watching movies and using their laptops.

"Not bad, but not stellar
Didn't start out on a good foot with this one, they gave away my reservation and were ""booked up completely"" when I checked in at 1:45M (a wee bit sleepy). Another customer came up and returned his key saying he couldn't stay in the room and stormed off. The attendant took the key put it in a sleeve and said, ""something has just come available""
I imagine I should've felt relieved that I'd be sleeping in a bed that night, but instead I was irritated they would dish this room to me without checking it out. when I was given the key I was told ""...your room may not have internet...it's in the wing of the building that hasn't been renovated""

First... all the windows overlook the interior lobby. The lobby is nice. Things that are bad:
A- Severely out of date rooms. Ceiling damaged, framing showing around mini-fridge, and closet doors that don't stay on track. Everything, minus the TV, needs to be replaced, even linens.
B- Being in an active train station is not ""quaint"" I was woken up multiple times a nite by the noise and shaking. I live in NYC and can normally sleep through most distractions.
C- Executive level is basically in the lobby, closest to the trains
D- Staff was pleasant, but could use an update in self presentation
E- Executive club's sparse offerings
F- too much bleach in the towels

"Horrible
I recently stayed at this hotel for a two week business trip. It was horrible. Me and at least 10 of my colleagues were not able to get their rooms cleaned, some not even getting service for several days on end, even after contacting the front desk and requesting service. Then some people would get service when the ""privacy"" sign was on the door. Plus the rooms were never really cleaned. They failed to take out my trash on a few occasions, there was a layer of dust and dirt in between my bathroom vanity and the window (corner King room), pretty sure my sheets never got changed, my floor was never vacuumed the whole two weeks, and on my first day there I stepped on something sharp on the floor so I'm not sure when it was vacuumed last. This is totally unacceptable. And to make matters worse, me and several other colleagues had items stolen from our rooms, from food items and cosmetics to non-prescription drugs One colleague's tablet computer was even used while they were out of the room (at which point the ""privacy"" sign had been placed on the door, someone still entered the room). I've never stayed anywhere in which the guests were so blatantly disrespected and ignored. We were told the issues were ""under investigation"" and given a $25 credit to our room. (oh yay *sarcasm*) 
On several nights, there was a strong odor coming from behind the bar on the second floor, which smelled like sewage. The staff there seemed to be aware of this problem, but could not do anything to resolve the issue. I would think the local health department should have concern over this issue, since food and drinks are served there; and I hope, for the health of your guests and staff, this be looked into. 
I will never stay here again or recommend the hotel to anyone. I doubt my company will either. This is unfortunate since the location and size of the hotel, and its proximity to so many great businesses, would otherwise make this the best option for Columbus. I was surprised that such a large hotel chain failed in so many ways to provide adequate service.",1.0,1

"Outdated Renaissance Experience
Outdated Renaissance Experience
There were three problems during our April stay in the LAX Renaissance Hotel:
Our small room was overfilled with outdated mismatching furniture -- it was difficult to navigate in this overstocked room.
Five days before I left home, my credit card had been charged for the cost of the room for the entire length of my stay. When I checked in, I was asked for the credit card that I was going to use to pay for my room. I was asked to prove that my credit card (show my credit card statement?!) had been previously charged for the entire room cost! It seemed like the front desk had no record of my payment though my credit card had already been charged.
Parking not free, breakfast not included –- compare this to the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks up the street where the rooms are the same price, are uncluttered, parking is free, breakfast is included, and the morning newspaper is delivered to your room door.

"Good Location but......
We enjoyed our stay at the Hudson and found the hotel and the room pretty good, albeit we had a delux double and it was still very small. 
Positives are the location easy to walk to most places and close to the park. The staff was on the whole really nice and helpful with any requests. 
Couple of negatives are that you can hear every single sound of street noise even 10 storeys high I could here laughing shouting cars sirens, and on top of this our air conditioning unit was SO noising that whilst trying to sync from London to New York time this did not help and kept us awake for a lot of the night - it was a toss up between being awake and freezing or awake with noise but warm!!!! 
There is not mini bar and to be fair no amenities in the hotel at all other than the hotel bar and restaurant. The food was good in the restaurant but an odd concept of selecting a dish from the pass - it was good but if you are screwed if you want to eat the same as you someone else in your party as only 1 of each dish at a time available!!

"I booked using trip advisor reviews.
When I arrived I needed to use a restroom. I was escorted to a hotel room that had yet to been cleaned. No public restrooms available for guests. Later when my room was ready, Room 127, It was clean with fresh paint and varnish smells. I decided not to complain, I would take the smell over crusty carpet in other reviews. When I turned on my bedside lamp at 4am, ###cockroaches scurried off the table###. I reached for the phone to call the front desk and more bugs scurried. So I grabbed my cell and called the front desk. He was polite and told me he would need to call me back. 
I loaded my luggage into my car, took a shower, curled my hair and dressed for the day. No call returned yet. I drove to the front desk. (free parking is a great plus at this hotel). The night clerk said he did call me back and I didn't answer?? I said I had my phone next to me. He said he called the room. I never heard the phone and the trunk of my car was only 10 feet from the door. He said the manager would be in after a 8 am, I should call him. OKay, it's 4:30 am in LA what do you do? I found a McDonalds and slept in my car.
After 8am I called and was told the manager would be in after 10am. My next availablity to call was later in the day. I got a hold of the manager. It was quite a confusing phone call. We had a bit of a language barrier. But I understood that the problem was addressed and I could return to my room. (meaning the bugs were extermenated). I said I did not want to return. He credited my charge account for the next two nights of my stay, but said he would not refund the $$ for the first night since I left with out telling them, and I did not let his employee to come to the room?? Which was not correct. He said he would talk to his employee and get back to me. I said check you cameras. I had not moved the cones in the parking lot or my car till after 4:30am and talked to the clerk before I drove away. What should I have done? I have never run into cockroaches before, I did not want to bring them along for the rest of my trip. 
!!At what price of a room rate should you expect cockroaches are exceptable?? !!! He told me I had quite a discount on my room and they are always sold out. Like that woule make me feel better about the bugs?
I ended paying double for the next two nights for my room and $25/day parking. 
 The pool was clean. I saw employees working outside restaining the furniture. It was really better than expected from the reviews. The room was small, two double beds, small frig and microwave. Minus cockroaches it may have been fine. The neighborhood was shadier than I was comfortable walking around in.

The other big problem was wifi - v patchy coverage so in only about 10pct of the room could I get a signal on any of my devices. Complaining didn't result in anything useful and thisis really not acceptable in a business hotel. Otherwise fine.. Great shower, good bar, comfy bed, friendly assured service. Air-con noisy, Asti often is in these old converted buildings.. Just come here with your lover, not your briefcase!",3.0,3
"Never again
You wont catch me dead at this location again. Room was disgusting and I'm pretty sure I saw someones crack pipe in one of the drawers while I was moving a nightstand in front of the door hoping it would wake me up if someone tried to break in the room.",1.0,1
"Crown Plaza has made substantial improvements
We are just leaving the hotel today and would like to commend the management team for the positive changes. 
The front desk aptitude and service has improved, the rooms are remodeled into much nicer rooms as the hallways.
There is still work to do. We found food and personal items in the bathroom had been opened up clearly someone had been given access to the room before us or the cleaning job was not properly done. We also had a payment issue where we were charged for the internet without having use it but the manager, Mr. Ralph Spates resolved and diffused the issue when the front desk person was insistent on charging us.
The hotel has a Jazz Club. We were disappointed that there was no music on a Saturday night. The bartender explained that there is only music on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
All in all, we had a good stay and we will be back to stay here whenever we need a stay over.",4.0,4
"perfection....
Great location, views, rooms.....what really sets this hotel apart is the staff, however! From start to finish, they truly go the extra mile to be sure your stay is top notch. If I could give this property (and most importantly staff) 6 stars I would! If you are looking for the best hotel in Seattle, look no further.....",5.0,5
"Urine and mildew and false advertising
From the first phone call, the desk woman seemed nervous and unprepared, which, of course, made me nervous too. I booked my room only to get a call a few hours later that the room I booked (that was advertised) was not actually available as it was still ""under construction."" She apologized and said that, although I would not normally be entitled to a refund, they would of course refund me for this issue. I guess they realized that when they're not letting me stay there, they can't actually charge me! It was only when I pleaded with them to find me something else in the area - which they should have offered to do since they were false advertising - that the woman agreed to do so. A couple of hours after that, I received a phone call saying that suddenly a room was available. Wow. Magic, huh?
Upon arrival, I became even more worried. The entrance was narrow and the place smelled musty. The lobby carpet was old and dirty and you have to walk through a very narrow hallway to get to the front desk (very poorly planned this is), which made it almost impossible to get a couple of small bags through at one time. Next was the interaction with the front desk. Though I didn't catch her name, the woman that checked me in was so nervous and apologetic at the same time, it made me feel like she didn't know what she was talking about. She was all over the place, trying to do several things at once, but not really keeping her attention on me, the customer. She sure did take a few calls though and mess around with papers on her desk while I waited patiently. Along the way, she lost the key to my room somewhere underneath her messy papers. Finally she found it and told me where my room was (On the first floor, thank G-d!).
Upon entry to the room, I knew that I would not be able to stay there. It smelled like urine and mildew (the first being disgusting and I'm allergic to the second). Since I knew I'd have to start the arduous search for another place to stay that night, I attempted to sign on to the internet. After all, they do guarantee wi-fi. However, the wi-fi didn't work in the room I was staying in. After going back yet once again to the front desk and the woman agreeing to reset the router, the internet still didn't work. It was at that point I explained that I had to leave. Urine and mildew smell and no internet. Ugh.
The woman at the front desk then insisted she smell the room I was in before she would agree to issue any kind of refund. Once she got into the room, she did indeed confirm that it smelled. It was only then that she agreed to refund two of the three nights I had booked. She couldn't refund the first night because that was against their policy. I guess the smell of urine and mildew and the false promise of internet is not against their policy. At that point, I was so disgusted, I just left. 
Do yourself a favor, DO NOT STAY AT THE CHELSEA INN!!! This is a warning. If you don't heed it, don't expect anything more than what I got. However, if you enjoy the smell of urine, the idea of mildew infesting your lungs and don't care about internet, you'll love it!",1.0,1

"I thought the Westin Orlando was the worst till I stayed here
I am a Platinum Member and had two rooms reserved at this hotel . I was in the Platinum line when the surly young lady behind the counter informed me that they were full and a convention hotel so I would not be upgraded.
I went to my room ,which was smaller than the 180 sq ft rooms at the W Hotel on lexington in New York. The air vent in the bathroom sounded like an airplane was getting ready to fly out of it.
When I called the Manager on Duty ,she informed me that they had suites available and moved me to one .
In the end , the hotel looks like it is stuck in the 80's and its been redone recently.Awful place ,stay some where else.",1.0,1
"Drury Hotel
Lovely hotel lobby, breakfast was good, but got boring after several days. Kickback was very good. Make sure when making a reservation you are in the main tower. The San Fernando Tower is a pain -- you must take an elevator to the 6th Floor, walk several hallways to the next set of elevators for floor 9-14. Decor in living area is depressing -- very dark. Ice machine was not on the 10th floor where we were staying, also pools are in the main tower which meant another walk to the elevators. Value was OK -- last night our rate jumped higher ??? Don't know why. Although on the riverwalk, we overlooked San Fernando Cathedral, for the rate we paid, thought we'd get a better view. Staff front desk, housekeepers or food service - all were extremely friendly and helpful.",3.0,3
"Stay away -- worse than motel 6
The location is terrific, but so is every Manhattan hotel. Among all the Manhattan hotels I have stayed in (more than 10), this is the worst BY FAR. The room was smaller than hotels in Japan. There was no shower pressure. The TV was in Spanish, and the guy refused to do anything to fix it (I had skipped out of dinner with friends at my conference to watch a Lakers game). The air conditioner was mounted on a wall at ceiling height, away from the bed, and there was nothing to climb on, so you would have to stand on the edge of the bed and try to peer at/guess at the controls.
Overall, this was the second worst hotel I have every stayed in, and the worst value for money I can remember in a long long time (they charged more than $200 a night).",1.0,1
"Get anywhere from here
This was a very nice surprise for a midtown hotel. Rooms are right up-to-date and clean, clean, clean. Bathrooms really nice. They're also larger than I expected for the price and location. That's not to say they're large, but they're very comfortable with enough space for everything we had with us, although we are light travelers. The hotel is in the flower district, so every day you walk out the front door, it's like being in a garden. There's a subway station less than a block away. It's 2 blocks to Penn Station where a lot of the long-distance bus companies now drop off and pick up, so no taxi ride needed even with some luggage for bus travelers. Breakfast was expensive at the hotel, so we just went up to a great place around the corner on 7th Ave. near 29th. The concierge was very helpful. This is a tall skinny hotel with only 4 rooms per floor, so everyone is near the elevator. But it was still quiet as a tomb at night. There's even an indoor pool, but we didn't try. It looked nice though. We would definitely stay here again.",5.0,5
"Cheap & clean but a little worn
My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights in October for doctor visits at MD Anderson. We had a 2nd floor room overlooking a huge swimming pool and you can sit out on the balcony which is nice. The beds were comfortable and clean, however the room AC unit is positioned by the window so the air blasts right on your face while sleeping. Otherwise, we slept okay and it was quiet.
The bathroom fixtures are old and when first turning on the shower, the water runs out brown, like it hadn't been used in awhile. We couldn't really get the water temperature regulated for the shower (it was scalding hot, then cold, then hot) so we just took baths. 
The television remote wouldn't work so someone came to fix it, but it quit working a few minutes later. It didn't matter since we didn't watch much TV anyway.
The hallways and lobby have a funky smell -- like an old motel. 
Breakfast was pretty good with cereal, muffins, toast, apples, waffles, juice and boiled eggs. Coffee, not so good, but there's a Starbucks right next door!
Overall, if you're trying to save money and you have to stay a few days, it's okay, but I will try a nicer place next time, even if it costs a bit more.",3.0,3
"Just okay for us...
The lobby construction was a turn off right away but the staff was very nice and accomodating. They try to make up for the lack of lobby with a hospitality room with coffee/tea/water and snacks. The hotel location was good for our group heading to a race in Central Park and there was plenty to do in the area. The rooms were small but clean. The bathroom very old and outdated and the air conditioning was very loud and not really adequate. I would probably not stay here again but would not discourage others from doing so because it was really a good price.",3.0,3

Everyone was super friendly to the point where we felt sad we were going to miss our friends. How often do you give your concierge a hug and say thanks for everything man, I really enjoyed my stay? That's what you will get at the Sanctuary hotel! I have been to nicer looking hotels, but none have ever had that personality that make this place super special!

"Stay somewhere else, EVERYBODY ELSE DOES!!
This place is a dive. First thing we noticed was the lack of people staying at this motel. The rooms are in terrible disrepair. First night we stayed on a broken bed, they moved us to the room next door. This room's shower drain was plugged and the sink leaked. If you're a salty serviceman than this place will suffice, but if you have family go somewhere else! Rooms are filthy. Cob webs and hairs abound. Stay away! It is also a terrible part of town!

"Great hotel, but rough neighborhood.
My husband and I just spent 3 nights at the US Grant with another couple. It is a beautiful hotel with a great lobby bar and nice wine. The downside was that I walked a block to CVS one morning and felt uncomfortable being out alone as there are many homeless people in the area around the hotel. We did find it was within walking (a good hike at times!) distance to lots of fun restaurants, waterfront, and Petco baseball park. The staff was very helpful and concierge helped us book at a spa around the corner that was wonderful. We had a great weekend! I would rethink this area if I were taking our children with us-it had a Bourbon Street feel to it. It was a fun destination for a couples weekend!",4.0,4

My family of five stayed here for 3 nights. The beds were very uncomfortable and our room was noisy! You could hear all traffic and hall noises. (We were facing the courtyard.) The elevator smelled horrible. One actually had what appeared to be urine in it. We are told at check in that the wifi would be $10 a day and after some discussion we decided we would use the wifi. What they don't tell you is that it is incredibly slow and it's ten dollars for each IP address. We had two cell phones and a laptop so were charged thirty dollars a day!! After a heated argument at checkout we only had to pay $30. The only good thing is its location but there are dozens of hotels in the area. Needless to say we will not be staying here again.",2.0,2

Terribly low water pressure! If you like a robust shower in the morning, this may not be the place for you. We had 3 rooms, on two different floors and this was the first thing we talked about every morning at breakfast... We think they've maybe taken 'saving water' a little too far, for our crew in the Jewel's sister property, Club Quarters, located two or three doors down, had great water pressure.

"Blake Hotel Should Reimburse California Delegates for $310 a night dump
Stayed 4 nights for the Democratic Convention. Good points: bed was OK, my shower was strong, lobby OK, complimentary newspapers.
Bad points could fill a book, and my room wasn't as bad as many others--at least my shower worked and the carpet wasn't wet.
Rooms and 'services': Dark, dingy, ugly rooms--it just had the feel of a place that needed every surface deep-cleaned, and updated out of the 1970's. Phone never worked despite requests for service--they asked if I didn't have a cell phone. So much for wake-up calls. No directory of services/extensions (there WERE no services.) Elevators inadequate and unreliable and so beat up they looked like a slumlord's dream. One day one got stuck and when we got the door open we were afraid to ride another one so all walked down the stairs.
3 ice machines for 14 floors. 4"" space under our door so we heard every sound from the hall. No coffee pots. Internet signal weak and sporadic. No towel bars in bath, only place to put on make up had a nauseatingly yellow florescent light, and there was a big brown water spot on the ceiling. I heard there were people who had wet carpet in their rooms, so I guess I was lucky. Ancient hair dryers. Last day we got no maid service. In interactions with staff, they were always polite, as was everyone in Charlotte, but you got the feeling they were embarrassed and couldn't promise anything would get better. And despite having paid $100 per person for a 4 day breakfast package, they slipped an extra breakfast $28 charge on the bill.
Restaurants: One over-priced, the other was cheaper but nasty: essentially a circular bar with cheap folding tables set up around it. Menu items not available. Bartender told me the place was sold a month ago and new owner had set up the bar last weekend just for the convention, all the employees were temps, and it would close down the day after the convention. That free bottle of cheap wine they gave us after there were so many complaints was just a joke.
Location: isolated. There is NOTHING around this place. No restaurants, drug stores, nothing. Several blocks in the heat and humidity to go anywhere on foot. So once you're there, you are stuck with cabs or a miserable walk. We passed lovely looking hotels with bustling restaurants and amenities in the vicinity, but this definately isn't one of them.
Cost/Value: By my calculation, this dump made over a million bucks off the California delegates, at a rate of $310 a night. I don't know what the hotel assignment process was, but whoever selected this armpit for us should be ashamed. More like a $100 a night motel. We should get money back.",1.0,1

The staff could not have been any better. The restaurant food and service and atmosphere was as perfect as could be. Breakfast was on the expensive side, so we walked 2 short blocks down on 11th Ave and found two diners, one of which had an entire fresh breakfast for about $7. The only downside was that it is about a 20 minute walk to the Broadway shows. This hotel is highly recommended.",5.0,5

"beautiful property, disappointing service
I chose this hotel because of their Plaza view. When I checked in at 12:30, I was delighted that the Signature Room was ready. I was unaware though of the Music Festival taking place during my visit until I arrived in my room and heard the sound system blaring, even on the top floor. Though a musician, I asked to be moved for more tranquility. Since the new room was not ready yet, the front desk asked for my cell phone, saying they would put a rush on it and call when it was ready. At 5 PM I came back to the hotel, though I was never called. The room I was moved to was significantly smaller, not renovated, with a tiny bathroom and virtually no view. The bathroom also looked like it had been cleaned in haste.
The property is beautiful and in an exquisite location. They attempt to offer matching service, but do not (or did not) quite deliver. There were several other similar issues which may have been my experience only. The morning of checkout I asked to buy a pillow from the room. The front desk checked with a manager who said they could only do so through the website, but that he would send me that link. He did not, nor was it available on the website. I spoke with someone today who said I could have purchased it there, and am now being charged delivery because of this incorrect information.

"Elevator waits dampen stay
I stayed a Monday night here, and the hotel was inundated with junior high kids part of a local convention. My room was on the 22nd floor. I don't have any complaints about the room itself, however the wait time for the elevators was truly unacceptable. For at least 4 trips up and down, I had 5-10 minute waits. On Tuesday morning at 9am, I waited 15 minutes to get down! Once I was down, and was trying to get a light breakfast and some water from the on-site Starbucks, the Starbucks had a line of 60 people deep! The day before, I asked the hotel staff where I could fill up water bottles, and they referred me only to the Starbucks, stating that they had no water fountains. I felt like a hostage to my 22nd floor room, having to plan out my trips to the main floor lobby. Yes, there was water for sale in my room, but at a ridiculous price. I paid $270 for my room, plus $20 in parking -- no free internet, and only frustration with the elevators. Hotel staff seemed unconcerned, and stated it was not a problem. The kids were respectful, I think it's a problem with the layout of the hotel -- too large for only six elevators. 
Mini bar was locked, but after requesting a mini-fridge to store breast milk, they did comp a mini-fridge delivered to my room. That was nice, but it took two requests and there wasn't much that could overcome my frustration with elevator wait times.",2.0,2

"A real disappointment
My husband and I stayed at the Omni Parker House for a long weekend and were so disappointed with this hotel. We booked using Priceline and what a huge mistake. We've always agreed with Pricelines interpretation of 5 star, 4 star, etc. But not this time. What a joke! As many others have noted on here, the rooms are not only small, they're rediculously small. To make matters worse, my husband had a broken leg, so had a cast and there was no way he'd be able to sleep in the full sized bed, as it was pushed up again the wall and using his crutches was a real challenge in that room. I called down to the front desk and asked if there was any way we could get a room that could accomodate someone in crutches. I was told they were completely booked and nothing could be done. The hotel didn't appear full, so I called the hotel directly on my cellphone and was told they DID have rooms available. Hmm... so I called back down and explained that when I called the reservation line, was told there were rooms available. I then got the sales pitch that others have posted on here also received----they could upgrade us for $50/night. The response was literally VERBATIM from what others have posted on here. They must have a script for the complaints from the Priceline users. My husband finally took over the call and was finally able to get us moved to a room that could accomodate someone with crutches without us having to pay the $50/night. Very disappointing that we were lied to about the hotel being full and that we had to go through THAT much frustration to get a room that could accomodate someone with a broken leg! We literally wasted 1 hour dealing with that. A real 4 star hotel would have never put their guests through that hassle. 
The room we finally received was small, but at least two people could move in it without one person having to sit on the bed. And, my husband could get in/out of the bed with his cast. The hotel needs some repair...the ceiling plaster was coming down in our bathroom and the walls are really, REALLY thin. During our stay, the police arrived at 1am to escort some young ladies from a guest room near us that were hysterically crying. Again, not what you'd expect from a 4 star.
The beds were comfortable, free internet (if you sign up for the loyalty program) and the location is fantastic. Right on the Freedom Trail
I wouldn't use caution if using Priceline to book a hotel in Boston, as it appears this one is awarded frequently. Probably the only way they can fill the tiny, tiny rooms. Not all rooms are small though. If you're willing to pay the full price, you could get a regular sized room. But, it's not worth the gamble and there are LOTS of other hotels in the area that are simply fabulous. We won't stay here again.",1.0,1
"Stylish, but...
Stayed at the Dream Downtown in early April. Location is ok. 
Staff at reception was super friendly. Hotel is very stylish, which I like, unless it becomes unpractical. Using the sink in your bathroom without creating a mess is not possible. Getting into the bathroom itself is annoying. The door is super heavy and the hole to pull it open is sharp edged.
I ate at the restaurant twice. Lunch and breakfast. Food was great. However the service at breakfast was suuuuper slow, although it was late and there were only a few guests. A couple of times I had to get up and look for the waiter...
When I tried to get a cab the door man advised me to go to the next street....
The rooftop bar/club is not part of the hotel, so don't expect to get in just because you stay at the hotel. The ""gatekeeper"" seemed rather uninterested in those inquiring about how to get in unless it seemed he either knew you or you brought women. 
So overall great looking hotel with a few flaws that might or might not bother you.",3.0,3
"Good location but crowded, rushed and only 4 sun loungers!!
We arrived around 2pm and it was quite busy with taxis arriving and leaving seemingly all the time. Check in was fine although not particularly welcoming (staff seemed a little bored). Room was ok, though we were on a seperate block (which is connected to the main block with a covered foot bridge). Unfortunately this looked out on the side road where the coaches parked and the ""double"" glazed windows were pretty much useless with LOTS of noise coming in. I'm usually not that bothered, but they kept revving their engines and playing music loudly which was annoying.
The beds were ok, nothing special but what sleep we did get (the walls, doors etc are quite thin!) was ok.
Flat screen TV in the room was modern and quite easy to use. Aircon unit was loud though.
We had a fire alarm go off at around 10pm, and everyone filed out. There was no real organisation, just a fire truck turned up, some firefighters went into the building and that was it... panic over. But the amount of people outside showed how busy this hotel got.
The weather was awesome so we decided to go for a cycle along the promenade and across the Golden gate bridge. Pier 41 is just a block away from the hotel and really easy to get to, so in terms of location this is excellent. Pier 39 is about 2-3 blocks away and again is easy to get to.
We decided to come back and use the pool area. the pool was good and the area clean however they hotel only had 4 (yes count them FOUR!) sun loungers for the ENTIRE hotel meaning that they were long gone when we got there. If the manager of the hotel reads this GET SOME MORE LOUNGERS!!!
Luckily for the cost conscious of us, there is a Safeway supermarket right opposite the hotel (its a multi-storey carpark which you can walk through to get to it). We found eating out in California generally quite expensive (after tax and tips) so decided to have sandwiches , coffee and pastries for breakfast and lunch.
The Concierge service was excellent and they bent over backwards to help, so credit to the guys at front.",3.0,3
"Disappointed
I have stayed in motels that are better than this place. The carpet had holes in it and there was a big stain by the air conditioner. At one point, I tried to pull the desk chair over so I could set my cellphone on it while charging and the armrest came off. I had to push it back together. The bathroom was old; sink was chipped and had rust stains. I tried to use the coffee maker to make hot water for tea and I ended up with black specks and white chips on the bottom. I tried the room service. The pancakes were undercooked and the fruit was not ripe. The shuttle service took 35 minutes to pick me up. The driver then proceeded to drive at a breakneck speed. My seat did not have a headrest. If he had gotten in a collision, I would have had severe whiplash. The van also had holes in the seats and was quite dirty. Next time, I am going to pay the extra 25 dollars on priceline and stay at the Grand Hyatt. This was not worth the extra discount.",1.0,1
"One of the best hotels in San Diego!
My husband attended a conference at this hotel and I joined him What a lovely hotel and staff. The grounds are impeccable with a beautiful pool area. The rooms are very nice and housekeeping were great. The restaurant and bar was open, inviting and the food is good with a very good happy hour menu. The location is superb!!! Lots of shopping, restaurants, coffee shops, costco is just down the street and has a gas station if you have a car. Old town is just a few miles down the freeway which is right around the corner. One of the best restaurants we tried is ""Saigon on 5th"" which was in the Hillcrest area and the food is amazing. We will stay at this hotel everytime we return to San Diego.",5.0,5
"Tired hotel in nice location.
Had to stay here for a conference. Grounds were very pretty. Room seemed to be an attempt an update (new flooring, beds,etc.) Bathroom was very old and rest of room just looked ""tired"" despite small cosmetic fixes. Real problem was zero soundproofing -could hear everything from other rooms, especially when someone turned on a shower. Smoking is allowed on patios (one story rooms) and the people next to me smoked -it filled up my room. (I am not that sensitive to that but it was two feet from my door and came in the air vents. I called to complain, but they said smoking is allowed on patios. That is NOT a non-smoking experience. If I had been traveling with my small children, I would have immediately changed rooms or hotels. I am a woman traveling alone, and the conference had to have two guards at the entrance - I wondered about that until I walked back to my room and two of the hotel employees cat called to me on the way. Did not feel safe. This is not a place to relax.",2.0,2

"2 nights in the Bedford
I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in April 2011 which cost just under €320. 
Location was FANTASTIC...walking distance to so many attractions. 
The hotel itself was only average...the room was a good size but a little old fashioned and the bathroom was clean. I guess the fact that I paid nearly €160 a night...I felt a little let down!
I would recommend this hotel...if I return to NYC and if the price was right - I would make a return to the Bedford purely for its great location.",3.0,3
"granddaughter does Dallas with grandparents
we invited our granddaughter to join us to visit the Chihuly exhibit at the Dallas Arboretum. She is 8 and is just starting to venture away from her family for an overnight adventure. we booked our trip thru AMEX Fine Hotels program. my husband and I have stayed at The Mansion before and were wanting this trip for her to be magical....and they surely provided such for all three of us!!!
upon check-in our room was upgraded from the Executive Suite (900 sq.ft.) to the Master Executive Suite (1350 sq. ft). this suite comes with a kitchen, dining area, living room, powder bath and very luxurious bedroom and master bath....but the killer was the beautiful baby grand piano in the room!!! our granddaughter was awestruck!! fortunately we had already visited the
arboretum exhibit because our granddaughter announced she didn't want to leave the hotel...
Julie at the front desk was a doll! our GD wrote her a thank you note. we had dinner in the restaurant and it was superb!!! the sweetbreads and fava beans are the best I've had ever, I think...and I rarely make such statements.
I cannot find one thing average or disappointing about our very magical and memorable trip!!

This is a nice place to stay if you are in the area. The staff is great and very accomodating. Denise mentioned Ivory, and she is very kind and helpful. She will go out of her way to make sure you are satisfied. I was impressed with her hospitality. 
The king room I had was huge. Everything was functional and comfortable. There are several good restaurants surrounding this property including Salt Grass, Pappasito's (Unbelievable. Try the Mexico City chicken soup. It comes with white meat shredded chicken, rice, diced avocadoes and cilantro. It rocks. They also have a warm salsa with a bit of a kick.), and Chilis. Sorry, I digress. I get caught up when talking about food. 
I was pleased with my stay here. I really don't have any complaints, but maybe a suggestion. The lighting in the room is all fluorescent and it's just a little stark for my taste. It feels like being in the office. I know that the pressure is on to convert to energy saving mercury-laden bulbs, but I'm still having a problem with it. Maybe it's just me. It doesn't feel homey. Maybe others like it...I don't know. Personally, I still enjoy the warm, cozy glow of an incandescent bulb. To each his own. I just turn the lights out and open the window.
I would recommend this property without hesitation.",4.0,4

"Good stay, right next to LAX
This is THE closest hotel to LAX (literally right at the beginning of the ramp to departures level). Was easy to get to, and easy to navigate to other LA spots too. Only parking is valet at $22/day.'
Very quiet inside - even though my room overlooked the airport there was no airport noise in my room. Comfortable hotel and room. Good overall quality. Nice bedding and great pillows. Bathroom showing a bit of age (wallpaper edge starting to lift, some chips, cracked sink).
Staff are the real gem here - always greet you, very pleasant and very attentive to assist. I was 30 minutes from leaving to catch my flight, with a wet head of long hair when discovered room hair dryer not working. Housekeeping got maintenance up fast and within 10 minutes a new dryer was installed.
Excellent breakfast in restaurant.
One note for improvement - they don't have card access controls in elevators, so all floors fully open at all hours. This needs to change, especially with how busy it is, where it is located, and large numbers of people around. Floors should only be accessible with a guest room access card as is the case in most better hotels, and even in other Radisson hotels.",4.0,4
"Too Noisy!
I realise this is New York City and you have to expect some noise but this was a joke....My travel partner and i stayed Mon oct 15 to Wed oct 17, i was coming in from Las Vegas NV, He was coming in from Toronto. I told the hotel to add him to the booking just in case he turned up first which was done with no problems.
On the day i arrived i got into JFK and grabbed my bags and took a cab, After pulling up at the hotel the bellhop literally ran out and had grabbed my bags and ran into the hotel by the time i had paid the driver. 
The guy at the desk was very friendly and issued me a keycard and then panicked because he had checked in my partner and thought he shouldnt have, I assured him all was fine and that my partner was on booking. 
I made my way up to Room 806 on the 8th floor, and first impression of room was that it was your typical NY size. I liked the design and the bathroom had a real ultra modern look as well. 
Bathroom had wall mounted tolietry dispensers and everything we needed. So we went downstairs and had a drink at Gastro Bar, Nice bar with a good range of drinks and nice atmosphere, The hotel is located in the garment district between 8th and 9th on W 35th. A 15 to 20 min walk into Times Square and i tend to agree with some people in that it almost seemed a little deserted at night with empty stores around but with the Police Station next door. 
After dinner we headed back to the hotel and once we were ready to go to bed the problems began...... After watching a little television (Decent tv with good selection of channels) we got into bed and turned off the lights....about 10 mins later we hear a loud bang and then our neighbours enter their room, They were so loud we thought they were in our room! About an hour later they finally settled down and we went to sleep. The next day i was in the shower and for anyone who has an Iphone i could hear someone in the next room typing out a text message! And as you know Iphone's really aren't that loud! 
We decided just to stick it out since we were only there for 2 nights. The second night we didnt hear as much noise and we were conscience as we realised everybody could hear us too. 
At check out the following morning we asked for a cab and whilst the girls were friendly at the desk, noone asked how our stay was.
Unfortunately despite it's cleanliness the walls and insulation are just too thin and we'll stay somewhere else next time.",3.0,3

"COMPLAINT: DISPLEASED WITH SERVICE
My family had a reservation on Saturday, July 7-8, 2012 for JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa. I live in Houston, Texas and wanted to try out your resort for the weekend, We arrived around 2 pm and wanted to check-in, (in our reservation, we had requested a double bed room), For some unknown reason, at our check in we were given a room that had only 1 King size bed. We went back to the front counter to let them know that’s not what we had requested, and I was told they were waiting on double rooms to become available and we could wait in the lobby for the next couple of hours, or we could go sight-seeing and our luggage could be kept at the front desk. After waiting an hour or so, a double room became available. We went to our room put our bags down and decided to head for a swim, after an hour or so of enjoying ourselves, we were sitting down in the pool chairs by the Pizzeria restaurant and we were making dinner plans. We were approached by an Older Gentleman that literally snatched our floating tube from our hands. I responded to him by saying we were still using the floating the tube, He replied in a very loud, hostile voice, “it’s not your tube, it belongs to the hotel”. Not only did he act very aggressive towards me, but I felt threatened by his behavior and was also concerned about my safety. I immediately informed somebody from your staff about the incident. I had a restaurant manager (Will) come and talk to me, but nothing was done about the incident. The worst part was that the older gentleman kept coming back to the area where I was sitting and was laughing at me, in other words, I was being bullied and humiliated by another guest. At that point I started crying and was extremely upset. Feeling humiliated, I went and talked to another manager at the front desk (Joseph), I’m sure he noticed how upsetting this incident was for me and how I was having a hard time keeping my composure. I strongly feel that your staff did NOT do anything to resolve this matter, in my opinion, I don’t think they even cared about the incident. I am very disappointed with the way it was handled. This behavior should not be allowed in the hotel, and I did not see any type of security personnel in the Resort. I have never been discriminated against or treated with such disrespect in my life.",1.0,1

"Where to Begin
A hotel experience is a summation of many small details, most of which the Inn at Lincoln Park gets deeply wrong. Here, in no particular order, are problems experienced during a recent stay: 1) surly staff lacking the authority and willingness to fix problems/address concerns, 2) only 1 person at the front desk so that there was always a wait, 3) dirty, outdated, smelly carpets, 4) claustrophobic, cheap-looking elevator, 5) skeevy, scary looking floral bedding with cheap pillows, 6) major plumbing problems – initially switched rooms due to a dripping shower, subsequent room had another leaking shower and a running toilet 7) TV not working 8) weak/unreliable internet connection, 9) broken ice maker, and 10) old, cracked bathroom tile. Was so spooked by this hotel that I checked out after the first night, refusing to spend my second night there. On the positive side is a great location. Love the area. Do not love the hotel.

We stayed here one night over the veterans day weekend. Simply put - the rooms are old and filthy. There is no excuse for a hotel chain of this magnitude to allow the conditions of there hotel rooms to become like this. We went to three different rooms and all of the rooms had a yucky old wet mildew smell to them. The carpet was dirty, the beds were lumpy, the hallway carpet was dirty, and staff appeared unconcerned.

Room was OK - but no coffee maker or hair dryer - have to trek to the lobby for ice. Parking was free, but you're parking right by where the local gangs hang out.",2.0,2
"Very unhappy
Shower head didn't work, sprayed everywhere but on your body. 
Night clerk, Dan, swiped my credit card for full amount of hotel plus some, even though the hotel was already paid for through another agency. I even pointed out to Dan that our hotel room was already paid for and all he needed to swipe my card for was incidentals, and Dan agreed, but he swiped my card for the entire amount anyway. It's now Wednesday and that amount is still on hold in my bank account. I spoke to a lady in accounting, Merissa, who was very nice, but not able to help me.
The amenities the hotel provided didn't include any of the common items we're used to at a hotel of this rating. 
I wouldn't recommend the hotel just due to the overcharge/hold on my money, but the shower head problem (which they fixed after everyone had suffered the other shower head) and the inability to fix the money issue has compounded my bad experience.
To be fair the hotel is in a great location and it's pretty in the lobby area.",2.0,2

"Now I understand the hype
Visited San Antonio last weekend for a basketball tournament and opted to stay on the Riverwalk. After finding a discounted rate the morning of (my husband is a govt employee), we chose this hotel and I am glad we did. It was right on the Riverwalk as the name suggests which can sometimes prove false despite the location given by a property. But it was actually the case. We did valet for $19/day which was pricey but standard for the hotels in the vicinity so I guess we can't complain. The staff were nice and very helpful so that was a plus when needing to unload our bags. 
We stayed in room 712 which was a corner room so it had several nice big windows to view downtown out of. The room's decor was older, Texan comfort style but it was older in a nice way. It didn't take away from the room's presentation or appearance and met our standards 100%. The bathroom was nice and updated. It had granite countertops, a nice sized tub/shower, and plenty of towels which is important when traveling with family. The beds were clean, nice and very very very comfortable. My husband commented that he had the best night of sleep he'd ever had in his life that night so that speaks volume.
We took the elevator to the roof top pool just to check it out when exploring and it too was nice. 
I took advantage of breakfast the following morning and it was superb. Lots of great, quality choices such as: bagels, biscuits, pancakes, fruit, sausage, eggs, cheese, oatmeal, juice, etc...I was very impressed with the quality being that I am used to frozen, pre-made continental breakfasts being offered at most hotels. This was definitely a perk. The hotel staff were walking around asking if customers needed anything, cleaning off tables in a timely manner, etc...it was definitely a refreshing experience. We didn't get to take advantage of the happy hour and free appetizers/drinks due to our tournament games but I am sure it was just as nice as the breakfast and I hope to try it out if we are able to stay again in the future.
Nice, clean, easy access to the action, updated, good, great, free food, friendly, helpful, pleasant staff....what else can you ask for in a hotel? Would recommend to anyone and will be our San Antonio choice moving forward. 5 stars all of the way!",5.0,5

"OK Accomodations, Poor Service
This was our first visit to NYC, and we expected more for the price. As other reviewers have stated, the room was a good size, the beds were comfortable, and the area was quiet. Our room, however, wasn't very clean. We moved the nightstand and bed to find an outlet and discovered LOTS of dirt and a few used tissues. The doors had dirty hand film on them, and the sheers hanging over the air conditioner unit were gray with dirt. The shower had mold in it. You should be able to expect much more for over $300 / night! You don't even get breakfast for that rate! Our main complaint, though, was with the bellman staff. We wanted to store our bags after check out, since we wouldn't be leaving the city until later. We were hastily directed by the front desk to stand at the door to the side, where we stood in line with another family for about 5 minutes, before someone noticed us and told us to go to another door across the lobby, where someone would meet us. This employee had no idea what the SERVICE industry is about. He was condescending and very rude, and when one of us snapped back in frustration, he told us not to be rude! We noted this same employee earlier literally ripping a luggage cart from a guest's hands, stating ""there are ours""(indicating the bell staff). He didn't even ask he if he could help her with her bags!
As for the parking garage...it was very convenient. Although this was a private company,we were told by Holiday Inn reservations personnel and this hotel's front desk that it would be $27 for the first 24 hours and then a pro-rated per hour rate after that. When we picked up our vehicle, we were told we had to pay ""overtime"" and pay for the whole next 24 hours! There was a sign in the garage showing the rates, and it showed partial day rates. We would have paid less if we had paid for the first 24 hours and drove out and then back in. How absurd! Holiday Inn should get their story straight on this...we feel like we were lied to.",2.0,2

Initially, this hotel presents well; I liked the lounge and restaurant area.

If you drive a large vehicle (Hummer, etc) think again. The room was fair, but crowded with furniture. The in-room microwave was a plus. Plastic cups for the bathroom at a Sheraton? Really? The shower here was lousy. It is a bath/shower combo where you re-direct the water flow by throwing a switch. When it converted to the shower, there was very little water pressure.

"Ideal location but showing it's age
THE GOOD: This hotel is fine if you are looking for a Mag. Mile center location and plan on being out most of the time. With its location next to many restaurants and shops, the best feature of this hotel has to be its address. Starbucks in the lobby is always a welcomed sight for me. Floor to ceiling windows in the room with nice view (I was on the 30th floor).
THE OK: Rooms are just OK, nothing special. Typical older Marriott room, clean, but aged. It's a downtown hotel, so not massive in size, but much larger than I thought it would be.
THE BAD: The valet workers were all very friendly every time, but upon my early morning check out at 4am, they actually brought me the wrong car. I had a silver rental car and they pulled up in a red Chevy 300! Not happy as this error was making me late and not happy as it could have been someone else in my situation driving off in my car.",3.0,3

Got interrogated on Saturday night by the doorman. Can I just get to my room please? I understand you have a nightclub on weekends, but as a paying guest, I shouldn't be harrassed.
Final straw: restaurant on Sunday has the odd practice of closing for breakfast on Sunday and then reopening for brunch an hour later. I have never heard of that and because of that we couldn't eat before we had to check out.",2.0,2
"Very disappointing. Road noise is severe. Ridiculous restriction on TV volume seems like a bad joke.
We booked this hotel on Priceline for a really cheap rate, so I wasn't expecting much. I suppose coming away from the Four Points Sheraton in San Antonio for the same price and same star rating probably ruined it before it even had a chance though. Now that was a great experience that set the bar high! Anyway....we switched rooms a total of three times at the Crowne Plaza over a four night stay. The only reason we didn't leave immediately was because of the Priceline return policy. After the third room we decided to put up with the problems...something you should never have to do with a 3 star hotel, in my opinion.
We checked in fairly early on the 1st day, but the front desk staff said our room was ready so we made our way upstairs. To our susprise, the room was not ready and there was still a maid cleaning the room. We politely waited outside for about 10 minutes before deciding to say something to her. She was very nice and was shocked that we had been sent to the room since it was not ready. She then said something about the air conditioning/heating unit not working. When she turned it on it made a ridiculously loud whining noise that was obviously wrong. She said their handy man would come and look at it. We said ""OK"", dropped off our bags, and left to get some lunch. When we came back the AC was going full bore. The room was freezing, but the fan sounded fine. I quickly changed it over to ""heat"" setting and the sound immediately started back up.
Side note for a moment: All three rooms had a wall ac/heating unit with controls on both the unit and a wall thermostat. The entire time I was there I never figured out how to use them together. This could be user error, but I doubt it. I would shut one off and let the other try to work on it's own, but they would never work without some weird balancing act between the two. Very frustrating.
I walked down to the front desk to ask about changing rooms. The staff was fairly friendly about it but said there were no more rooms with a King bed. I was traveling with my wife, but we are fairly small so I said a double would be fine. I also took the opportunity to ask about another point of frustration that bothered us the entire time. The volume on the TV's can never be lowered below a level of 10. This is not a huge considering the amount of road noise at seemingly all hours of the day or when the AC/Heat is actually working, but it was generally right about the comfort level for us. I was shocked when they told us there was no way to get it lower. It apparently had something to do with the new HDTV's and their stupid hotel menu service for ordering movies and other crap. Some channels were unbearable also as they seemed to just be louder naturally. I told them I wouldn't get that stuff anyway and they said they would have their ""head engineer"" come take a look at it. He (an assistant manager no less) said something about removing the software lock and letting us use a master remote. That never happened.
As we settled in to room #2 I made the startlingly discovery that our mini-refrigerator was missing from the room. Had it walked away because it hated the hotel as much as I was beginning to? We had to get to a rehearsal dinner for a wedding so we decided to say something on our way out. The not-so-friendly woman at the front desk told me it was located under the TV in the cabinet. I assured her I knew where it was meant to be, but there wasn't one there. She just stared back at me in disbelief. The previously mentioned assistant manager appeared and said they would have one sent up and installed quickly. To my great frustration the poor little fridge was still missing when we returned almost 6 hours later that night. I immediately called the front desk to ask about it. They said they would check and call back. I waited 30 minutes and called back. The person asked ""You still haven't gotten one?"" which of course never calms someone down. She then put me on hold to ""check again"" and the line was lost. I called back immediately and someone else picked up. They said their assistant manager would be back soon and only he could help. Another 30 minutes later at 11 PM the asst manager calls and said they would send one within the next 30 mins...which actually proved to be true...finally. We tried to sleep, but it sounded like World War 3 outside with police or fire sirens all night, practically on the hour. I wish I was joking.
The 2nd night was pretty much the same, but we were so tired from helping with the wedding all day that we slept better. On the fourth day I asked about moving to a different room and was told to check back around noon. Fair enough. We ran out to run some errands and were happy to find we were being moved to another room....luckily it had a fridge ready to go. I did, however, immediately noticed the road noise was louder though. I walked over the window and found that the noise was actually coming from the AC/Heater unit. These are wall units installed in a box within the wall. There was roughly a 1/4 space around the top of this unit that let air and noise from the outside directly into our room. This was the 3rd room so I decided to attempt to fix myself. I shoved a towel into the crack...literally....and then layered a few more on top of it. This helped...barely. We made the decision to just turn the fan on non-stop and deal with being too cold than deal with the road noise at full level. Plus the ridiculously loud TV would drown some of it out. 
While I was ""fixing"" the AC unit, I also noticed the fan inside was horribly dirty. It looked like it had never been clean. I decided to not tell my wife that little piece of info or we would have been forced to move yet again. I would recommend steering clear of this hotel. The road noise is aweful! Sure the staff if pretty nice (usually), but I would rather have a quite, dark room for sleeping any day and that does not appear possible at this location. You have been warned!!!",2.0,2
"Great Location, Value
I've stayed here a number of times, and there's no better value for a downtown Chicago hotel. I don't think this is your spot for a romantic getaway, but if you're traveling on business or on a budget, this puts you in the middle of the loop for a reasonable rate. The location is tough to beat, as you're right on the river and within walking distance of both Millennium Park/Grant Park and the Mag Mile. This would be a perfect spot for Lollapalooza attendees.
The staff is absolutely over the top in their efforts to be accommodating and welcoming. Other than the location it's the hotel's greatest asset. 
The rooms have a full kitchen, which again for a budget traveler is a huge benefit. (But less of a value if you're vacationing and plan to eat out a lot) The room layouts are unusual in some cases, but roomy and comfortable. The hotel is probably at the point where it needs a facelift, and in some areas the ""wrinkles"" are starting to show. Always clean, just well used. The furniture is clean and in good condition. 
They have a standard free breakfast every morning, which (again) for a dollar-conscious traveler is a huge plus. They have a small business area, though it's best for simply printing off boarding passes. There's free wi-fi that's acceptably fast. 
So, clean, comfortable, and convenient, just not sexy in any way. HOWEVER, if you're willing to pay for the upgrade, the top-level suites have open air balconies that are awesome.",4.0,4
"Clean Room, Decent, Nice Outdoor Pool, (but Feels a Bit Outdated)
I would actually like to rate this hotel ""Good"" but it seems I have to choose between ""Average"" and ""Very Good"" so I will have to commit to ""Average."" But in fact I think the hotel is a bit better than average: ""Good"" or ""Above Average."" 
Pluses: Nice outdoor pool area, fitness center, free Wifi, clean room w/plenty of space, big flatscreen TV, $115 king bed room, nice front desk staff, nice soft sheets, nice smooshy feather pillows, take SuperShuttle from airport for $17.
Minus: Place has the look and feel of a nice, old hospital or institution. 
This hotel style-wise seems like it's from the 70's and seems as if it is in the middle of trying to modernize and upgrade. It has a bit of an identity crisis. Even where they have apparenly purchased new furnishings and decor, it looks like they tried to match them to the old decor so it still feels old and a little austere. The dressers, desk and side table in my room look like hospital or dorm room furniture. Same with the new fixtures in the bathroom, which are paired with old tile and tub. The carpet seems new and soft. I think the bed is new, but looks oldish. An interior door and the tub faucet has old rust on it, but most of the fixtures appear to be new. The carpet in the main area seems not clean, though I think it probably IS clean. It just doesn't look like it. Decent towels. The bathroom is very clean, as is the room. A room air conditioning unit works well, makes a little noise but I kind of like that to drown out any other noises. The easy chair in the room is faded and stained and kind of covered with industrial plastic-y upholstory instead of regular cloth. The desk chair seems brand new. I think the bedspread is new, but the style is like from the 70's I guess to match everything else. The wallpaper in the halls is that kind of plastic-y wallpaper you'd find in a hospital or older apartment building. The front desk staff was very nice, signed me up for the rewards program, pointed me to my room and the fitness center, pointed out the restaurant and gift shop and gave me the Wifi password without me having to ask about any of it. At the airport, I just walked over to the taxi area and saw the SuperShuttle and they have a negotiated $17 price to come here which I understand may be about half what a taxi charges. I don't know what other hotels are around here to compare it to, but I prefer a Comfort Inn Suites or Hampton Inn Suites-type hotel which is more modern and cushy. If you were to book a guest or family member here you wouldn't exactly be impressing them with style or luxury. However, there is certainly nothing wrong with this hotel: the folks are nice, the price is good, the rooms are clean, the outdoor pool area is nice, they have a fitness center and free Wifi. All in all, I have no reason not to recommend this hotel as long as you aren't too put off by the institutional feel of it.",3.0,3
"Old and worn
I travel a lot and stay at a lot of hotels. This better be inexpensive because it's worn down and old. Fitness room has very old equipment. Haven't seen a treadmill like that in over 10 years. No mini bar; only a vending machine on the 3rd floor.",2.0,2
"Great Hotel
We loved this hotel. It's in a building which used to be a post office in the 1800's. Very grand, tall ceilings in the area we were in. Was told that the rooms throught the hotel are all different. We were in room 248, called the box rooms by the front desk. We liked the room, a bit small, but you expect that in downtown hotels. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and large enough. It's a bit pricy, one week cost me more than my monthly mortgage, but the location is so worth it as it is right across the street from the Verizon center and the Metro line. No free breakfast which we usually look for, but there is a McDonalds and a Starbucks a block away where you can get a cheap breakfast. Breakfast in their restaurant cost the two of us nearly $50, ouch!! We only ate there once. Only 4 blocks from the National Mall. Location, Location, Location!!! Great location and great hotel.",5.0,5
"Stay away!
I was in Memphis on business with the hospital so they recommended I stay at the Hampton Inn because it is just across the parking lot from Baptist East. Based on my experience, I will stay ANYWHERE else in Memphis and drive ANY distance to avoid staying here again.
To begin with, the hotel is old and dirty. Rooms are dark and stale smelling. When I woke up the next morning after a restless sleep on the uncomfortable bed, I found a quarter and a dime in the bed along with a pair of dirty socks (none of these items were mine).
The service level was even worse. I called the front desk several times during the stay and only once did anyone answer. I almost missed my flight the next morning because the front desk mishandled calling a taxi to the airport.
I could go on, but this should be enough info to STAY AWAY from this terrible hotel!",1.0,1
"Worst stay ever!!!
Asked for Non smoking, 1bed room with a spl request of microwave. But got Smoking!, 2 bedroom and no microwave. Wifi didnt work for the first day!
Worst ever stay!!!!",1.0,1
"Non-stop noise.
Apparently my first review got deleted. We stayed here for a weekend in order to attend a friend's wedding. The room was ok, what we expected for the price. The big issue was the non-stop noise and disruption from some kind of large group staying at the hotel. Gaggles of Hispanic and Indian teens, running and slamming doors and hanging out outside our door. We called in numerous noise complaints, to no avail. I pitied the person working nights, as she was up to her ears in complaints but (according to what she told me) couldn't do anything without her manager. It was awful.",2.0,2
"I might stay again if I had to.
When we first arrived we found out that the bathroom had not been cleaned and told it could not be cleaned till the next day. The man checking in said to us, 'It is only a travel lodge after all"". That became the joke for the rest of the weekend as we found the rest of the room was not very clean either and there were somebody else's hairs stuck on the inside of our bedspread. The only gave us a $15.00 discount for one night and we had to stay 3 nights. I really was not happy with the experience. I would have been much happier if we would have received more of a discount on all the nights.",2.0,2
"Yotel September Trip - Spot on
Could not fault the hotel whatsoever. Staff were always very down to earth and made everything easy and seamless.
The room was slightly cramped but everything was situated well enough that you didn't need a lot of room. A part from that an excellent hotel all round.
Free wifi that had superb strength, free hot drinks, ice and water on every floor. Would definitely recommend Yotel New York and would definitely use it again.
Thanks.",5.0,5
"Good stay but couple of issues
Ok first things first. The hotel is very good, great location and most of the staff where very helpful. There were a couple of annoying things like being told I had used things out of the mini bar when actually they were some drinks I had brought from outside and also getting my car from the valet was a nightmare, I had phoned ahead for the car and was told it would be ready within 10 minutes, although I know it was a Sunday when I checked out, it was chaos and needless to say the car wasn't there. Apart from that I would happily stay again",4.0,4
"Under Construction
I am not complaining about the hotel but it would have been nice to know in advance that the pool was closed. That is the only reason we chose to stay at this particular Hampton Inn. We have two young boys who were very excited about being able to go swimming and the pool had been closed for a week and that was not posted on the website! The lobby and some other areas were under construction as well . The breakfast area was so small that we had to get our food and go back to the room to eat because there was nowhere to sit. The food was delicious and the rooms were very nice and clean but it would have been great to know all of this was going on at that time.",3.0,3
"Service is mediocre
Concierge is good to have put together a recommendation and map for us for things to do. The car was always available whenever we need it during the day. No service at night. They lack porters to greet you outside and load your luggages in the cart. It was also odd that someone brought us a fruit basket and water past 10pm and he kept knocking on the door. I appreciate fruit baskets and water but not past 10pm and not accompanied by repeated knocks on the door. The toilet had a clog too but they sent somebody up right away. Housekeeping also seem to not do a good job. Our bed smelled different on our second day there. Like someone else had lie down on it. It smelled icky.",3.0,3
"I would return to the hustle and bustle
What can you say, it is New York, expect expensive and people, people, people. The location is great for The Times Square Broadway play experience. The only problem, I had when entering the hotel you have to take an elevator to the 8th floor to check in. You have to punch in your desired room numbers on a box on the wall away for the doors. We jumped on thinking that we could just stop at 8, but found no buttoms and rode the elevator to the 25th floor. Helping three others that weekend find the secret to riding the elevators gave a chuckle. 
The rooms was very roomy comfortable and clean. I ahd no compliant on the comfort and softness of the bed. The bathroom has a great shower. I have two reservations about the room. I think internet access should be free to elite members of the hotel. I am not fond of the single packet new coffee makers. 
The gym was great, lots of new machines. They have a great sound system. They have water, headsets and even apples 
The front desk was very helpful, quick and courteous. I did not eat in the hotel as there was so many places to dine whether breakfast, luch or dinner. I did not use the business center. 
The Times Square subway stop is one block from the hotel. The $10.00 Metro card is the way to get around the city cheaply.",4.0,4
"We weren't robbed or killed. That's the only good thing I can say.
US Air put us up when our 11pm flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. After waiting on our bag and then the shuttle we didn't get to the hotel till almost 1am with a flight leaving at 7am. The hotel was super creepy. We were the only people there other then the desk clerk walking around this extremely dated hotel with a giant lobby/dining area that has two fountains and a gazebo. It was honestly a mix between the mall in the original Dawn of the Dead and the hotel in the Shining. Then we get to the second floor and the elevator doors open directly in front of an abandoned room that is under construction, door wide open, lights out debris every where. We turned the corner to see this extremely long hallway that just feels creepy. Finally getting into the room didn't help either. Our window looked into the creepy lobby right at the gazebo. The air/heat didn't work well, either you were burning up or freezing. The shower didn't drain. There was hair in the sheets which were so worn out they were transparent in spots. It looked like there was mold in the gross ceiling of the bathroom. Didn't really feel safe even with the door bolted. Felt like the kind of place that would have hidden camera's or a way to unlock your door in the middle of the night.
To top all of this off, when we checked in the desk clerk asked when we wanted a wake up call and when we wanted the shuttle to take us back. We said 4:45 for the wake up call and around 5:30 for the shuttle. We never got a wake up call but luckily set our phone alarms just in case. Then we get a call a little after 5:20 saying the shuttle will be here in 10 minutes. So we get down just a little after 5:30, within 10 minutes and the shuttle had already left. We asked the clerk and he just stated the current time implying we should have gotten there earlier. We had to wait another 30 minutes to get the next shuttle. Another couple had the exact same problem and was waiting too. At 5:54 the clerk called another room telling them the shuttle would be here in 10 minutes. We got on the shuttle at 6 and the other guest who had been waiting with us asked the driver if there was any one else coming and if we needed to wait. The driver shrugged and said he didn't know and started driving. So another guest probably missed their shuttle just like we did.
We would have probably been better off just sleeping at the airport or paying for a hotel or rental car ourselves. If you have a choice, don't stay here.",1.0,1
