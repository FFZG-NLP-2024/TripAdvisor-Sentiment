"Consider the parking a tax
We recently stayed at the downtown Austin Hampton Inn and Suites for five nights choosing it primarily because of location and reviews on TA. Although valet parking can be a nice convenience, it is rather irritating when the hotel makes it so difficult to self park that you have no option.
We expected to pay a bit more than usual for this type property because several events were underway in Austin, but I think it is over priced for what you get. And, the property is tired. I really appreciated the enthusiasm and helpfulness of the staff, but they had a lot to overcome.
The breakfast's were good, too, but the gratis happy hour is only for those who are interested in the act of imbibing alcohol and not caring what they drink.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Highly dissapointed
I have stayed in several Hiltons and this by far has been the worst with a modern twist. I stayed here 23-26 June 2012. I saw the bell hop and Valet go at it one night. Ordered room service for breakfast and dinner. Thankfully, I can not remember if the dinner was good or not, but the breakfast for two cost roughly 68.00 and was the worst, to put it simple I have had better breakfast being deploying. The food was cold, everything tasted as if it had been previously frozen and immediately warmed up and served. The shower area has mold around the tub. The shower head is the cheapest and does exactly just what is intended to do, which is get you and everything else wet while on. They do not offer many teleision channels (maybe 20 total). The bed was decent which is hard to find in hotels. The food was the worst HONESTLY and also the shower area as well. I will not stay at another Hilton when I return",2.0,1,1.0

"Nice Hotel-Sick Room
The hotel is beautiful and amazing staff. Typical hotel breakfast, coffee better then most. Our room was a very nice layout and a lot of room. Walls are definitely paper thin, could hear the people below us. The only bad thing is the room (422) had mold/mildew in it. We both started feeling really bad about 2 days in. I spoke with the manager who was very nice. She offered to let us move into another room, but we had so much stuff I declined. My fault, we should have moved; we both got infections. Our co-workers staying in building 3 did not have this problem, it was just our room. Anyone with bad allergies or asthma should be careful. I'm sure they are working on fixing the problem and I would still go back.",4.0,3,1.0
"Comfortable and clean, but basic amenities and small bathroom
My wife and I stayed here for the first time for the nights of the 3rd and 4th of July. Our room was on the 10th floor. We were amused by the funky black shutter doors - sort of giving the place a southern feel. In reading many of the previous reviews, it looks like they have quite a variety of rooms. We had a king bed room, but there was no refrigerator or kitchenette. Fortunately, we had a cooler with us to keep some beverages and snacks cold. BUT, we had to call the front desk to have ice delivered to the room - there is no ice machine available for guests! Also, there was no ice bucket, so I don't know where you'd keep the ice if you didn't bring a cooler. The bathroom was very small, and only had a narrow shelf above the sink and toilet on which to keep our stuff. There were a few rough edges in the preparation of the room; when we checked in, there was only one bath towel! Fortunately, there was a maid right outside, and she gave us a couple more. Also, while there was an iron in the closet, we had to request an ironing board. Despite these shortcomings, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. There is evening turndown service where they close the curtains, turn on a light and drop off a couple of bottles of water. Because we had showered after returning from a hot day at Nationals Stadium, we even had our towels replaced when the maid visited the room! The air conditioner was fairly quiet, and there was a ceiling fan over the bed to help move the cool air around. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an abundance of pillows. The location is great - our walk to the Mall for fireworks only took about 15 minutes. The DC Circulator buses stop very near by, and are only $1.00 with free tranfers within a two-hour period. The front desk gave us a map of the routes.",4.0,3,1.0

"Not bad...it's a Courtyard
Not a bad hotel. Walk in the front door and it's got that typical Courtyard Look with included ""Bistro"" restaurant. So you know what you're getting into... The staff was really nice and talkative and makes you feel welcome. Layout of the property is pretty standard Courtyard...unfortunately I drew the room at the far back end of the hotel - it wasn't bad, just all the way at the back. 
Room was standard double queen room...with a small bathroom, but liveable. The only real problem I had with the room was the volume button on the remote didn't work. No problem..there are controls on the side of the TV. I had no refrigerator, nor microwave in my room - that seemed a little strange, so I was forced to go to the ""Bistro"". I don't mind the ""Bistro"" except its way to expensive for the quality/quantity of such a captive audience...I'm not just saying here but at ALL Courtyards. I really wish they would fix this....
With regards to coffee...yes they have it in the room. It would be nice if they'd give you 2 each regular and decaf...1 cup of coffee in the morning typically isn't enough and having a cup of regular, then decaf is...well...not a good thing. 
So..overall typical Courtyard...you know what you're going to get...",4.0,3,1.0
"Good value, decent rooms
Right off the magnificent mile, around the corner from the Apple store, it's a great location. Rooms are okay, but dimly lit for my tastes. They gave me a courtesy upgrade to a corner suite, which was much appreciated, but the rooms themselves are fine, but nothing to write home about.
However, it's a good value for decent accomodations, especially when compared to some of the hotels right on the Magnificent Mile. 
Front desk had great attitudes, which is always niceQ",3.0,4,-1.0
"In desperate need of a makeover...
Not bad if you can get a good rate -- right in the center of the tourist district... but the hotel -- while beautifully historic, is in need of renovation. I was in the main building -- not the tower, so the tower may be better -- but rooms in the main building are old old old.. furniture is worn and carpeting stained. Really in need of a remodel.. even if it's just new fabrics. Side note: I'm super skeptical of these ""Decline Maid Service to Save the Environment"" programs like they have at this hotel.. particularly when they flood the place with newspapers every morning... if you're trying to conserve resources, there's gotta be a better way to do it. That said, the staff was helpful and friendly.",3.0,2,1.0
"Needs some work to really stand out
Generally, this location is what you would expect from a Hampton Inn. The rooms are clean, albeit somewhat small since this is NYC after all. The staff are friendly. The included breakfast is pretty much what you'd get at any other Hampton inn: edible, but nothing to write home about. The prices are usually pretty good for NYC (weekdays are sometimes on the high side as the hotel is close enough to the financial district to get some business traveler spillover).
They've gone somewhat overboard with the cushiness of the mattresses. I don't recall if that's true of other Hampton Inn locations.
The South Street Seaport area where the hotel is located has a good collection of restaurants, easy access to a TKTS outlet, and an assortment of shops (both major chains and small shops). However, the location is somewhat out-of-the way if you're trying to spend a lot of time in midtown.
The biggest complaint is that the place is fairly noisy - we heard doors slamming shut frequently, especially in the morning when people were going in and out of the rooms a lot. It's not surprising as the doors have absolutely no cushioning between them and the door jamb. It's metal-on-metal for the hallway doors, and wood-on-metal for the bathroom doors (and yes, we could hear bathroom doors in rooms down the hall slamming shut). A little rubber or felt strip on the door jamb would go a long, long way to quieting the place down. We mentioned the problem when we checked out, and hopefully this will get fixed. Until then, we'll be looking for a different place to stay on out next trip to NYC.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Overpriced and overcharged!
We stayed here for one night before our return to the UK as Hyatt House at Denver airport was fully booked.
Firstly,it is NOT quiet.You can hear the traffic quite clearly from the dual carriageway.The hotel needs at least triple glazing to cure the problem!
Secondly, no fridge in rooms - well we didn't have one!It was over 100 degrees outside.Also, they charge for water -$3.50 for a small bottle!
Thirdly, no complimentary breakfast, indeed no complimentary anything!
On checkout - I had prepaid for the room- I was told there were telephone charges!I'd made one call to reception to ask about breakfast.
This hotel cost over Â£140 a night and had I not 'officially' checked out I would have been saddled with telephone charges I had not made.
Overall, very poor value and service and Courtyard Marriott ought to be ashamed of themselves!",2.0,1,1.0
"Overcharged Card
As a Choice Privelage member I PRE-PAID for a discounted room 10 days before my check in date. I was traveling here with my husband and 4 month old child. As we checked in, the front desk clerk clairified that my room was pre-paid. An hour later I noticed my account had $160.00 pending in it. This was a terrible start to my mini vacation. We had budgeted a certain amount of money on a pre-paid credit card so we wouldn't overspend and this error put us in a HUGE predicament. The guy, Sean, at the front desk assured us it would be fixed in the morning. I went to the front desk at 7 am, where another young girl was working. She had no idea what I was talking about because Sean didn't bother letting her know his grave mistake. At 8 am I went back down to the front desk, where yet again, another young girl, Amri, was working. She was very kind, but also very new. We called our bank and told them of the error. The bank gave us a list of instructions the hotel needed to follow to reverse the charges and told us it would be 2-3 business days after the faxed letter the hotel would send. Amri assured us she would write the letter and fax it over. We requested a copy of the letter and the faxed confirmation sheet for our records. At the end of the day we went back to the front. The girl at the front desk had to call Amri on her phone and ask where the letter was. I never received my fax confirmation sheet as asked. This trip was spent with worry and anger. We had quite a few things planned that had to be canceled since the hotel was responsible for this money mis-hap. I have every intention of emailing, calling and faxing a letter over to the GM today. This was ridiculous. I have worked in the hotel business and never treated my guests this way. I will never stay here again.",2.0,1,1.0
"Very functional business hotel
Stayed for a conference at the McCormick Center. Motel offered free parking, a big plus; and a $3.50 ride on the METRA to the mcCormick Ctr. 3 stops, 6 min, quicker and cheaper than anything this side of a jetpack. Just as easy to go a few more stops into the downtown. Motel was surprisingly quiet, well-kept, adequately furnished, nice amenities like wi fi and very comfortable bed, HDTV to unwind. I didn't eat there, but.... I certainly felt safe enough, even walking back from the Metra station at 9pm (a brief 10 min stroll).

"Ace Indeed!!
My Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights last month for our wedding anniversary and my birthday on our 1st ever trip to NYC. This hotel is perfect for a short city break to see the big apple. 3 blocks south of Empire State Building and 2 blocks west of 5th Avenue and only 5 blocks south of Times Square Ace is ideally located for exploring Manhattan. Yes the rooms are small, but who comes to NYC to stay in the rooms? Very cosy atmosphere inside, the lobby buzzing in the evening, the staff are very relaxed and very friendly. Will definetly return here in the future for a longer stay to fully explore the city, and have no hesitation in recommending this place.

"Great Experience
We traveled to NYC from CT by train with our 6 y.o. son and had a great stay! The proximity to Grand Central Station made traveling by train a breeze! My son was immediately impressed with the ""fancy"" lobby and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I was nervous about noise being a problem based on some reviews I had read but we did not have any problems. There was even a dog in a neighboring room that barked as we passed in the hallway but we didn't hear a peep from inside our room. We got a great deal on priceline and were probably in one of their smallest rooms but still thought it was of adequate size compared to other hotels in NYC. We would definitely stay here again!",4.0,5,-1.0
"Room was dirty and smelly
We stayed here for 4 nights in April. We walked into the room (a small double) and it smelt like a cross between people smoking in there and an old person with a urinary tract infection. We asked to change rooms, but they couldn't accommodate us. They offered to put an air filter machine in the room, which they did whilst we went out for dinner. The room did smell a little better when we got back. 
We went to go to bed, but found pubic hairs in the sheets. Grim. When pulling out the bedside cabinet to plug in my phone charger, we were greeted with a think pile of what looked like talcum powder all over the floor. The bedstead was covered in dust too.
The walls and floors between the rooms are paper thin, so don't expect the best night's sleep.
The shower room was tiny. 
A microwave and coffee filter were provided. The coffee filter was unusable as it was covered in grime and dust. The kettle didn't work, so had to make cups of tea in the microwave......
The breakfast room is tiny, and the food needed stocking up more regularly (especially as the hotel was full at the time of us staying).

"Nothing too much trouble
Had one night in this hotel on the way back from Europe. The public areas and rooms are exquisitely decorated and the staff are incredibly polite and well-trained. The bar and restaurant are being remodelled but the concierge insisted on walking me to the temporary space for these (in itself, elegant) and introducing me to the staff so they would understand precisely what I needed. And the gym is superb! Modern, well-lit, and made exercising a pleasure. I would definitely return - the only possible downside was the very noisy air-conditioner, but I was so tired from traveling I would have slept through a hurricane.",5.0,4,1.0
"Only low price get this the upgrade from terrible
Our company ***used*** to use this hotel for flight attendants, 20 years ago, and I really don't remember it being terrific, however, after 20 years I went back on a personal trip, based on the shockingly low price for the fantastic location in Manhattan. You get what you paid for...I paid next to nothing and that is about what I got. To say the hallways are filthy is an understatement, the room closet had mold in it, chipped paint in the shower, the bed was falling apart and the head board had nails sticking out of it. On the first night, no hot water! I called the front desk, she said the whole hotel hot water was out due to a broken pipe. In the hallways you could see people running around, I suppose in an attempt to fix the hot water problem. A youth hostel would be an upgrade from this hotel, but again, for the location, you can't beat the price I paid. If you want the bellman to hold your luggage until check-in (which they will not do before 3pm), be prepared to pay $5 a bag. Yes, you have to pay, even if you are staying there, and then of course comes the tip. 2 people, 2 bags each, $20 plus tip, both on check in and check out. $50 extra just to watch my luggage for 3 hours. Really? This is like flying only you don't get anywhere. Truth be told, I don't spend time in the room in NYC anyway, so what do I care, but still, it is really filthy, so be forewarned. Want a great place? Try the two hotels that I discovered recently, The Jane Hotel, and the Yotel. Not high priced, small rooms, but really clean and trendy. Not too much higher priced than what you will pay at this dump. This is an historic hotel, and I being so old, I figured the hotel has no mortgage, so why not take this old classic and remodel it? Last word, this is a filthy, dump, hotel, in a great location.",2.0,1,1.0
"Great Location, average service
Spent 3 nights here. Rooms are huge and nicely appointed. Staff is friendly but not especially competent. In general, DC customer service is lacking, so the Quincy was average by those standards. Had to replace my room key 3 times, and one night a stranger with a key almost entered our room at 1:30 a.m. WI-fi was problematic. I would return, though, because of the proximity to both the orange and red metro lines, and it is within walking distance of the Mall.",3.0,4,-1.0
"A black eye for the Marriott chain
We are loyal Marriott travelers (even though we are not happy with the Marriott Corp's political activities), and having recently reached gold status we decided to stay at the ""flagship"" Marriott on Michigan Ave, rather than one of the nice Courtyards a block or two off of Michigan (gold gets you into the concierge lounge, which Courtyards don't have, and free Wi-Fi). What an amazingly disappointing stay we had last month. We arrived to be told that they had already given out all their small refrigerators, even though we had called three times in the last 2 weeks to reserve one. Then we found that we couldn't really control the temperature in our room (it was always too hot or too cold). When we asked about this we were told that many people were saying the same thing, that it had been a known problem for quite some time, and that we should open the window when it got too hot in the room (it was 35 degrees outside at the time). We spent our entire 8 night stay waking up two or three times each night either freezing or sweating! One of the two revolving doors leading out onto Rush Street (the main entrance) broke mid-week, and four days later it was still broken, resulting in a constant traffic jam at the remaining door, as people waited up to 5 minutes just to enter or to leave the building. The pool was chlorinated to the point that everyone's swimsuit was likely bleaching white. And in spite of several specific requests not to use air freshener in our room (my wife is allergic), the housekeeper used so much of it one day that my wife couldn't re-enter the room one evening for several hours. And get this: when we had UPS deliver a small package to us at the hotel (medical supplies that we hadn't managed to get while still at home), we were charged $10 for this ""service"" (in addition to the routine UPS delivery charges). Incredibly disappointing!!",2.0,1,1.0
"Worth Every Penny
First let me say, we got a GREAT rate on this hotel on hotwire.com. My parents and my family (including 3 young daughters who love to stay in hotels) had adjoining rooms on the second floor. What we absolutely loved was: the unique pool area. We loved the indoor/outdoor pool and whirlpool area. The fitness room was full of great state of the art, clean treadmills, machines, and weights. The towels were thick and luxurious. Sheets the same; high quality. Beds comfortable with lots of different sized pillows. Some incidentals were great: the toiletries high quality/pleasant smelling, shower curtain and shower head appeared brand new and clean, flat screen TV with great channels, WiFi access in our room, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, one cup coffee maker with TASTY coffee. And, I must say, the housekeeping staff deserve big huge accolades. They were the friendliest, most kind people - each making effort to greet us, and make polite conversation when we encountered them. The room was very quiet; we were not disturbed by noise from any other guests, and I really hope that any of our noise did not disturb anyone else!
The 'needs improvement' list was minor, and as mentioned before, we still feel that the room was worth every penny that we paid on hotwire and only listed here in the interest of suggestions for improvement: 1970's era bottle cap remover installed in bathroom, dingy tub bottom (still, mostly everything in room was very CLEAN), there was a hole in one of our pillowcases, pull out sofa bed was not comfortable, furniture was rather scuffed/old looking, sofa in need of cleaning, carpet and all of bathroom very worn and dated - old, slightly peeling wallpaper, very 70's looking shell in tub area, shower bar coming out of wall. My daughters also noted 'stinky' smell in hallway; I believe there were some guests who were smoking in their rooms, which is an unfamiliar smell to them. My daughters love nature - so the outdoor pond/swamp area was a draw for them. There is a lovely outdoor paved/track area that, if regularly cleared of the massive amounts of duck poop, would be a runners haven away from home. A simple working fountain might also do well to clear a moderate amount of the massive algae accumulation due to stagnation there. 
We did not choose to dine in the hotel restaurant, as the breakfast buffet price of $12.97 per person scared us off. There is a Waffle House around the corner that served us well. We also had dinner at Lola and Guiseppi's - rated #1 on Tripadvisor for Columbus restaurants FOR A VERY GOOD REASON!!! - and a 15 minute drive from here, in Gahanna.",4.0,5,-1.0

"Terrible experience at this ""luxury"" hotel
My husband and I took our two kids to Boston for a weekend trip. We reserved a room with 2 full size beds but when we checked in, we were told the only room left has a king size bed and offered us a roll-away bed. When my husband laid down, the roll-away bed collapsed and his head hit the wall. When we asked to exchange for another cot, they said they ran out of cots?! So my husband painstakingly slept in the broken bed for the first night while the kids and I slept on the king. The next morning, I called right away to request for a room change and they offered to move our luggage to a room with 2 full size beds as soon as it became available. That night we returned, we did move to a room with 2 beds but the shower was leaky (door wouldn't close entirely so water went out of the bathroom into the foyer area), the bathtub wouldn't hold water, there weren't enough towels and the toilet didn't flush well. Everything in the room looked new but quality was poor. The next morning we called the front desk at around 10am to inquire about Miel's hours for breakfast and was told they serve breakfast until 11am. When we got to the restaurant, they said the restaurant was closed to prepare for a party at 11. The only thing they would recommend was the food court at South Street Station?! We were disappointed by the hotel and will never return again. For the similar price range, we could've stayed at the Four Seasons which is more convenient to the tourist attractions.",1.0,2,-1.0

I'd give this 3.5 stars.

Someone commented on the overpowering scent of the bath products. I agree. Even the soap was really strong.
Hotel is huge and is on 2 different blocks. I found it faster to just walk across the street than to try and navigate the skyway plus elevators/stairs. Conference rooms are a maze.
Plenty of bars to choose from. Kind of expensive, but you expect that. The Irish bar not only ran out of all IPA's but even ran out of Guinness (it was Friday night). The bar manager should be fired for that one (seriously, he should be fired). The food in the Irish bar was really good (Shepard's pie).

"Unfortunately, Nothing Good to Say
I do a fair amount of business-related travel so have stayed in many hotels over the years, and have never felt compelled to write a review. Until now. The Hilton Garden Inn in Tribeca ranks among the worst, particularly when the cost of the room is factored in. And it's not just the cost of the room; it's the parking, too. If you don't plan to use your car during your stay, you have the option of paying $55 for valet parking. However, if you need to use your car, you have to use a parking garage about a block and a half away. I paid $40 for three hours in the parking garage, and an additional $55 for valet ""overnight"" parking. And while the hotel is located in a convenient spot, the room I stayed in was very small. So small that there wasn't enough room for two people to pass each other between the bed and the bureau without turning sideways. All I can say is that it's a good thing I'm petite! The room also was not clean. There were dust-webs in the ceiling corners, and the white duvets were spotted with what appeared to be brown lint. The furniture was also dinged in several spots. Moreover, while the bathroom in my room was clean, the bathrooms in the lobby were not. Wish I had something positive to say, but I cannot recommend this hotel.",2.0,1,1.0
"Centrally Located off Central Expressway
The location worked out great for us as we were in town visiting family. We were able to get off and on central expressway (I 75) easily, making it very easy for us to get to our family, as well as to stores for shopping and to several restaurants that we wanted to revisit during our trip back to Dallas. 
Stepping into La Quinta is like taking a step back to the eighties with dark green/blue carpet, popcorn ceiling, white formica countertops, and heavy dark green drapes. Our suite was well suited for a business trip with a computer desk station, lamp, leather chair and telephone. Also a sofa that wasn't quite centered under a large picture of a nondescript floral scene. Our room and bathroom was clean and although it lacked any certain style, our needs were met. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Our suite did have a small refrigerator, single serve coffee machine and a microwave. 
Be warned that Direct TV employees stay here and the entire parking lot was full of their work vans and there was lots smoking going on late at night outside. We were able to find a parking spot toward the south end of the building, which was actually closer to the elevator rather than having to walk through the front lobby. 
As the hotel is near the highway, there is a slight sound of traffic from the room, but nothing too distracting.
For breakfast, my husband went downstairs to retrieve hot coffee, a sweet danish and I had cold yogurt with a banana. Not too memorable, but it was better than nothing.

The hotel is in a great location right on the edge of the bay within easy reach of the cruise ships and day trip boats, a short walk from the USS Midway aircraft carrier/museum and about 10 - 15 minutes walk from the Gas Lamp district.
The hotel itself contains an English style pub/restaurant which serves food until 11 pm and is reasonably priced and does breakfast.

"no free breakfast,car park no business center too much noise by air condition !!!!
I have stayed there for just one night on last monday. Radisson Hotel is the closest hotel to Los Angeles Airport and it takes just 2-3 minutes to go there by car and 10 minutes on feet. The room was big and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was enormously big I have never seen a bathroom on that size before. I think the windows were shut down by the hotel to cut heavy noise or security reasons so it is impossible to have fresh air when you need it. The air condition was working too noisy that it is not acceptable if you are staying at a 4 star world brand hotel and the hotel was not offered free breakfast , business center and car park. I do not know why a 4 star hotel do not offer free breakfast ,business center,and car park even they could able to offer. You can use the internet free at the room if you have a laptop if not you can use p.c using your credit card at the lobby in a 4 star hotel !!!! The policies of the hotel is so weird. By the way the staff were so kind and helpful. I appreciate them. At the end I would never stay a 4 star hotel like Radisson again. I think it must not be a 4 star maybe 3 star.

Very old and very ratty condition. Nothing around you except a strip club, car rentals, and a joke of a Shell Food Mart. HOWEVER, this place is so centrally located for doing so many things in San Diego it might be worth the price. Also, according to signs, this whole motel is soon getting a face lift and remodeling.
Even with hearing aids OUT, the airplane noise is very bothersome. This place way overcharges for what you get. I would NOT wander the are at night.",2.0,1,1.0
"Old and Rundown but close to Graceland
I have just stayed at the heartbreak hotel and I was extremely dissapointed with the service and the hotel. The hotel refused to pick us up from the airport in the evening 10pm despite calling in advance to advise them of my arrival time and that I had been travelling for over 24 hours since leaving home. They just said NO.... We booked a room with 2 beds and when we arrived very late at night they told us that they only had a room available with 1 bed. When we arrive in the room my girlfriend burst into taers as the room was awful. It was located on the ground floor and was damp and musty. There was a sofa bed so we asked for it to be made up into a bed and they said sure here is the linen, do it yourself...!!! at 11.30pm at night, I don't think so I said. Eventually we complained and they moved us to a themed suite on the 4th floor whic h was nicer but very dark and dingy. This hotel is a great location for Graceland but it like a 2 star style very basic hotel. There is complimentary breakfast however it consists mainly of bread, muffins, bagels, cereal and cold hard boiled eggs. I enjoy the location but would stay downtown in Memphis I went again.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Perfect Location and Comfort
My sister and I spent three nights here in late June. We were in NYC to see a show and the Meridien's location was perfect. Right around the corner from Time Square, the Theater District and Central Park. We were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. A beautiful lobby, the beds were comfortable and the room was scrupulously clean. The wine at the cocktail lounge was overpriced (it was actually cheaper to drink the wine in the minibar) but the wait staff was awesome and they do capuccino right, so I was happy. The only complaints are that the charges for WiFi and for the use of the pool are exorbitant. WiFi should be complimentary these days and so should the pool, but if you must charge, make it reasonable. I will definitely stay at the Meridien when I go back with my husband.",5.0,4,1.0

"Great location but not clean place
I stayed recently for 3 days and the hotel is located centrally and most of sites within walking distance. I was attending a convention and the exhibit hall on the 3rd floor had very poor lighting. Exhibitors had to bring in table lamps light to lit up the place. The water fountain on the 3rd floor hall near the toilets were filthy with algae on the water sprouts. One of the doors to the the 2nd floor exhibit hall opened to trash collection and awful smell greeted us when the door was opened. For a hotel like Hilton, we did not expect this.

"Super convenient, and less than half the cost!
A two-night stay here for work was a great experience. The hotel's location, less than five minutes' drive from downtown, but at half the cost, was great. Breakfast was decent. The room was spacious and convenient. 
Overall, no complaints at all, and I'd certainly stay here again on a future trip to Houston.",5.0,4,1.0

I stayed at the Radisson Martinique in June 2012. The hotel itself is excellent. The rooms are in excellent condition and very clean. The hotel itself is in a great location, with subway directly below, close to Time Square, Macy's and many pubs. I would definately stay there again.",4.0,5,-1.0
"A crack in the Hyatt Reputation... oh dear....
I was excited to stay at this brand spankin' new Hyatt House and booked it without hesitation for both nights of my inbound and outbound flights from the nearby airport. My excitement soon waned. The hotel is in a shopping center that is somewhat still under construction. When I entered the hotel I found it to be very attracted and decorated in a retro style.The registration desk was well staffed. One person was answer a phone call. (Someone had left behind a stuffed animal, and no the housekeeping staff had not turned it in. The thought ran across my mind that I had better keep a close watch on my things here... that things don't get turned in to lost and found.) The other person at the desk checked me in and gave me a key to my room. The drive to the hotel was several hours for me and I was looking forward to getting up to my room and having a long soak in a hot bath. But first, you have to go back out to your car and put a parking pass in your car window. I found this inconvenient as I am traveling solo carrying all my own luggage. If they had emailed me the parking pass I could have done that before I came in the first time. Or, if I had known about this parking pass exercise I could have left my luggage and brought it in the second trip instead of lugging it back and forth, up and down curbs twice as many times as I needed to. Very thoughtless and inefficient of them. Not something Hyatt is usually known for. Once I got back into the hotel a second time, I headed into the elevator and didn't realized they were fancysmancy elevators that required you to use your room key to operate them. It would have been kind of the reception desk to point this out since it still isn't common practice (at least in my experience) for this to be the case of most elevators. I did think it was a nice safety feature. Having to go to the reception desk to ask how to work the elevator was embarrassing and it was now taking a very long time to simply get to my room. The bathroom was unusual in three ways. First, there is only a walk in shower, no bathtub. Second, the shampoo isn't the tiny little bottles, but a large bottle attached to the wall with a tiny pump to pump out the shampoo. ditto for the shower gel. The third unusual thing is that a full tube of toothpaste is provided. The bed is comfortable. It has a down type comforter in a duvet cover, so you if that is too hot for you, there isn't the option of just sleeping with a sheet. You also don't have much of a range of control in the temperature of the air conditioning. It won't go lower than 68 degrees. Check out time is noon. The signs in the parking area say you can't part there after 9:30. (I don't what you are expected to do with you car after 9:30???) Now, mind you ,,,, all this stuff can be lived with... Here's what cannot, and it echos back to the very first stuffed animal thing. I accidently left my carry on bag of very nice item I had bought in Hawaii in my room and guess what? Housekeeping never turned them in to lost and found. When I called the hotel I was told that housekeeping supervisor saw them in my room and thought I hadn't check out yet. Then when the housekeeper went to clean my room later in the day they didn't see them. ""Vanishing"" stuffed animals and bags left in rooms by mistake, rather than being turned in to lost and found rates this hotel terrible for me. It's a pity. I have stayed at and have loved Hyatt's for decades all over the world.",1.0,4,-3.0
"Good value for the money
When my small band of value-minded travelers go to conventions I'm put in charge of finding the hotel. While I'm usually wary of non-branded hotels I took a chance on the Pacific Inn. In general, we were pleased with the value for our money.
Check in was quick and painless and I was able to get my room even though I was there 30 minutes before check in time. My key didn't work but I went back to the front desk and got a new one. No great inconvenience there. The room was functional, though it's missing some of the amenities in just about every other place I've stayed: no hair dryer, no iron/ironing board, and no coffee maker. Apparently some rooms have fridges and microwaves, but not mine. They are updating some rooms though, based on the comments here, this seems to be a continuous work in progress.
As for the noise, I wasn't really affected by it. Yes, there are railroad tracks right behind the hotel and the airport is close by and you will hear the noise but they didn't bother me.
The continental breakfast consisted of individually wrapped bagels and danishes, fruit, coffee, and cereal. If that isn't enough for you there's a Jack in the Box next door and a Denny's up the street.
The convention center is about 1.5 miles away. If you don't want to walk you can take the trolley though you will need to change trains. Or you can just drive since convention center parking is $10. I would definitely consider staying here again if I'm going to the convention center.",4.0,3,1.0
"Hotel is nice but staff needs help
We stayed at this hotel for a night on the town in downtown Charlotte a few weeks ago. It is in a great location, close walking distance to most everything in downtown. The parking is nice too because there is no parking around, but they do charge extra for that. The hotel looks very nice, clean and inviting. However, the staff needs a lot of help. We arrived to check in at 6:30 well after the 3:00 check in time, and our rooms still weren't ready. We waited for over a half an hour only to be offered 1 room instead of 2 so we could change and get ready for dinner, and then tried to act like they did us a favor because the room was a corner suite. However, we wanted 2 rooms with 2 queen beds, not a king and a roll-away bed. Staffing is certainly an issue if they couldn't have gotten 2 rooms ready in almost the hour it took to get rooms after we sat waiting and then had to argue with the front desk about room assignments. Once we got to our rooms they were very nice, clean, comfortable beds. The only other thing I will say is that they do have window AC units that are either on or of and are loud, so if you're a light sleeper, be warned.",4.0,3,1.0
"Great last minute find!
While planning a last minute get-away to NYC my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this hotel and booked a room. The location was excellent for the site seeing we had come to do. The room was immaculate and had everything we needed. (The lobby also had a restaurant that although we didn't sit down to eat, it made the lobby smell amazing!). The staff was very helpful and even held our luggage for us after we checked out so that we could continue to explore the city! We booked the hotel the same day we were headed there to stay and I am very thrilled with their flexibility for check in and check out times. We were able to check in very late and were not at all rushed out the next day. All in all this hotel played a huge part in the success of our last minute plans!",5.0,4,1.0

The water park was good. The onsite restaurants were TERRIBLE. Never would recommend this place!",2.0,1,1.0
"Great location... everything else not so much
We made a reservation one month in advance for a room with two beds. When we arrived to check in, the lady made us wait more than half an hour while her manager tried to find a room for us. They tried to give us a room with one bed and even asked us to come back tomorrow and check if they had a room with two beds available. We said it was unacceptable so after the long wait they finally gave us a room with two beds like we had booked. The room itself was small and uncomfortable, the tv was not in front of the beds, but on the side. They charge for wifi.
The elevators took a very long time to come when you needed them. The food was not bad, nor good. I would not recommend having a meal at the hotel's restaurant. The breakfast buffette was scarce and if they ran out of something they would not refill it. Service took forever as well.
Also, when we checked in we specifically told the lady we did not want the bill charged to the credit card we had provided upon reservation. At check out it was already charged to the credit card. This was quite inconvenient for us.
On the other hand, the hotel's location is superb. Right on the magnificent mile, with shops and restaurants all around. The concierge is helpful.",3.0,2,1.0
"In need of some major TLC
I was in Phoenix on business and decided to stay at the Biltmore. From the moment I arrived, things seemed a little odd. From the series of construction cones and detours that led me to the hotel, to the rushed valet greeting. Things got progressively stranger.
I entered the hotel and proceeded to the check-in desk. They found my reservation in the computer and then mentioned they had a letter for me. The guy at the front desk then made a presentation out of going into the back room and coming out with a ""welcome note/ form-letter"" from management, thanking me for choosing The Biltmore. I've had this before at other hotels, and I understand they are trying to make the guest feel ""special"", but it actually just prolongs the check-in process. 
What made the letter bizarre was not the staged letter ceremony, but the fact that it didn't mention the room upgrade I was given, without any notification in the letter, nor by the desk clerk. I would think that if the hotel wanted to make me feel ""special"", they would have merchandised this at the time of check-in. Who doesn't like a room upgrade into a suite??? It wasn't until I got to my room I noticed the upgrade.
So I get into the room and tour the space. A good sized living room with a fireplace, a dining nook and a separate kitchenette. The room also had tall ceilings with large windows overlooking one of the pools. The bedroom had a king bed and a bathroom with a dual vanity, separate shower and sunken tub. The toilet was in a separate little room. There was a large walk-in closet. Most of these elements I love in a hotel room (except for the kitchenette, which makes me think of an extended stay motel).
At first glance, I did see that the decor was a little dated. (too many mirrors, old fixtures and electronics, a missing phone in the bathroom, etc) I had read reviews that also mentioned this and sure enough it was an accurate assessment. I was only there for one night, so I could deal...so I thought.
I was meeting some friends for drinks and needed to get cleaned up. I went into the bathroom and noticed that one of the sinks was running water. Did housekeeping accidentally leave it on? I tried to turn it off, but it was a thin, yet steady stream...not just a drip...coming out of the faucet.
I then turned on the shower and noticed that there was no real shower head on the pipe. Water sprayed out all over the floor as I tried to adjust the pipe so I could take a very cold shower. I didn't have much time, so I got ready and left. I should have called maintenance, but since there was no room safe to lock up my computer equipment, I didn't want anyone in the room without me there. Plus, I was running behind and would deal with this later.
So I returned to the room around 9:30p and ordered some room service. After a very mediocre burger, I start working to prep for my meetings the next morning. Since half of the lights in the living room didn't work (including the fixture over the dining table) all I had to work off of was the light from computer screen. This frustration cased me to forget the faucet issues in the bathroom.
Around 11:00a, I decide to head into the bedroom and get some rest. Since the faucet issue was not a loud drip, the sound wasn't going to keep me up all night if I closed the bathroom door, so I decided to just deal with it rather than wait for someone to come and fix it. (I tried to turn off the water source, but the pipe was too corroded and I couldn't turn it off.)
So I'm in bed, watching TV on an old set that needed replacement. I turn the TV off and I can the hear people in the room below me, hanging out and drinking on their patio. A few minutes later, my room started to shake, sounding like a helicopter was landing on the roof. The sound and vibration lasted for about 10minutes, and then finally stopped. But the people downstairs were still there, so the noise was replaced with another one. Not to worry, cause 5 minutes later, the loud vibration was back. This continued for about an hour until I had enough.
I called the front desk and requested to be moved into a new room. Nothing like changing rooms at 12:30a, when all you can think about are important meetings the next day.
So a bellman arrives to my room with the key to my replacement room. This new room was not a suite, and was actually a room class below my original reservation. I pack my bag and move in the dark of night, like I'm skipping out on the landlord. I get to my new, very small, room. It was much more quiet, and actually had a real shower head and faucets that turn on and off! It was not until the next morning when I noticed the worn nature of that room. (missing sections of wallpaper and moldy grout in the bathroom, etc.)
I check out of the hotel around 8am. On the way to the lobby, I walked past my old room. I then realized what the sound was the night before. It was coming from a neighboring pool structure, housing A/C compression units, or pool pumping systems. 
While checking out, not once did I receive a ""how was your stay"" or ""sorry about the conditions of our aging resort"" from the staff member checking me out. Not even when I made a comment about my displeasure with the resort did I hear an, ""I'm sorry"". The only person who asked how my stay was was the valet who brought my car.
As a business traveler, I could endure more in terms of a poor experience at a hotel / resort. If I was traveling with my family, on my own dime or design,I would have been much more confrontational about the experience. 
I actually feel bad for people who choose this resort for a vacation. There are much nicer, and prettier, options in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area to choose from. The Biltmore needs a major scrubbing to be considered a contender.",1.0,3,-2.0

"Above the rest
I am always super worried when I find a seemingly great hotel, at a great rate, in a great location but this Hotel truly surprised us..in a good way!
We always try to book directly through hotels as they will most often match booking site rates, and will also suggest options you may not have considered. Hotel Andra had a great ""Northern Neighbours"" deal that chopped 15% off the listed price, discounted valet parking 50% and came with discount cards to Macy's. Of course you had to be from B.C. or Alberta to qualify but there were many specials which carried similar options as well.
We snagged a SPACIOUS king room that by many other chains, would be considered a junior suite. There was a massive king bed, separate sitting area, lots of work space, wet bar, makeup counter, and very ""scandinavian"" bathroom that I absolutely loved the shower!
Needless to say, you are in an absolutely fantastic location. We parked our car the day we arrived and didn't go back to it, until we were leaving seattle. Everything is within walking distance, no need to take transit either. There is an excellent greek restaurant on the main lobby floor that we ate at a few times, even just for a quick beer/snack between our ventures around the city.
Even though the hotel was quite busy, it never reflected poorly in the service. We were well taken care of from check-in to check out. Make sure you also take some time to check out the library in the lobby, kick back by the fireplace and enjoy a glass of wine served straight to you from Lola..
I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, well managed hotel in a wicked location. I've never slept better away from home.",5.0,4,1.0
"WORST NYC HOTEL EXPERIENCE...LOOKS GREAT, MISERABLE HOTEL
This hotel is about appearances - it's very sexy and pretty - but once you get past the ""rouge"", it's not a proper hotel with proper service...
- when I checked in I was shown a dirty room. The next room they showed me was occupied. I finally got to my room at 2AM.
- the air conditioning didn't work all of the time (this during a NY summer) - I had to learn how to reboot the compressor myself as I grew tired of asking
- Wasn't getting Channel 4 in the room â that's the Olympics channel â called maintenance and was told it wasn't possible (was told that the wiring in the building let some rooms see Channel 4 and others couldn't) - so I missed a lot â miraculously the issue was fixed after complaining a fourth time...seems the wiring is fine.
- the phone flashed all of the time but there were NEVER any messages â ever. Was told to pull the plug out and put it back in â is that really the solution?
- no room service menu in the room or on the fancy ipad (which baffles me). Called 3 times and it never arrived. Finally called the restaurant and they recited the menu until I found something that ""sounded"" edible. When food showed up I was told that Housekeeping had the menus and thus the delay. I did ask, ""yes but isn't there a restaurant in the hotel with menus?"" to which I got a non-answer answer.
- drinks aren't served on the lobby floor patio â which makes no sense.
- was told the rooftop bar wasn't for guests â that I'd have to get dressed up and wait in line for the privilege for a cocktail in my own hotel
- understand they can't serve alcohol on the street level patio â but how about juice??? I sat out there for 3 hours one night and was never offered a glass of water
- ipad â the ipad in the room should, if it were intelligent, contain the room service menu, local restaurant lists/guides, shopping guides, etc. - it doesn't â it's a barely formatted ipad which defies all marketing logic
- came to the room and the door wouldn't open â took 2 engineers and my mother making a lot of noise to get it solved quickly
Staff were extremely apologetic every time and in the end the hotel comp'd my ride to the airport...which is all fine but I prefer to stay in hotels where I don't have to hear ""I'm very sorry"" every day for what I consider to be service basics.
This hotel was a total disappointment...right there with the Soho Grand.

"Nice to get away, but limited to choices at resort
The resort was nice and very large. I recommend getting a room overlooking the big pool or near the lobby or expect to walk a lot. The room was nice and comfortable. The pool area is VERY packed on the weekend. Seems like a lot of people not staying at the resort somehow have access to the pool with their 5 kids. The adult pool was pretty cool but the cantina/bar closed at 5 pm on fridays and saturdays. What is that all about? I was at that pool for an hour and saw a dozen people go to the bar only to find out it is closed. Food options are extremely limited and pricy. Pointe in time food was just ok but expensive. The atmosphere in there is very nice.
I never stay at the same resort twice but if I did this would not be a place I would stay a second time. I am an HHonors member. One very nice aspect was the staff was very courteous and friendly. They even give us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries because it was our anniversary.

"Good base for pre/post flight out of Seatac and exploring Seattle
My family and I only stayed one night as I had to pick my brother up from Seatac airport. Deciding to make it a nice outing we went to the zoo and then checked in at the hotel to end the night. Check in was quick and efficient, and the room was clean, contemporary in design and best of all, quiet when you consider the proximity to the airport. We had dinner at the restaurant and though the meal was brilliant we felt a bit out of place as we had our over tired infant with us. Good thing to keep in mind if you have little ones, it's best to eat outside of the hotel so you don't feel rushed or disturb the other diners' experience. The food is worthy of slowly savouring, and we tried our best to do so while keeping our son quiet/fed/entertained.
Don't forget to check out the hotel's ""living room lounges"" with its complimentary snacks and Haagen Daaz ice cream! The grounds around the hotel are great for a stroll and the scenery/landscaping are beautiful.
All in all, this hotel well exceeds the price you'd pay and is worthy of its high ranking on this site.

"Good value and cute, but read on
I stayed here for two nights in Jan 2012
Pros: 
1) The location is perfect for tourists. 
2) This is a boutique hotel. It's very artsy and well decorated, and somewhat gaudy. When I first walked in, I thought I had inadvertently entered a trendy restaurant because of the decor. I was turning to leave and a doorman approached me to ask if I was looking for the BW. I expected he would send me somewhere else, but to my surprise he told me I was in the right place. There's a beautiful fish tank behind the check-in desk. Staff were all very polite, but reserved. 
3) The value was good, but please read the cons as well. Through my company, the hotel was half the price of others in the area. The room was nicely decorated and clean. 
4) Internet speed was good, 10M down 4M up during the afternoon. 
Cons:
1) The biggest problem was the heat. It was HOT in the middle of January. I can't imagine this place in the summer. I walked in and one window was slightly opened, and the room was 85F. I turned the AC on high and set the temperature to 40F. The room would not go below 78 with the windows closed and the air on. The entire floor was warm, not just my room. The room did have a portable fan. Before going to dinner, I opened all three windows, and put the fan in one. I hoped a pigeon didn't fly in because there are no screens. Returning I was pleased to find the room temp had dropped to 63. I dropped the AC from high to low, and closed the windows to try to sleep. Around 2am I woke up sweating because it was back up to 80F again. I opened the windows to breath, but even on the 14th floor, that lets all the noise of NY city in. There must be a boiler room below on the 13 floor, because even when I turned on the cold water, it came out hot. After running for a few minutes it will get cold...but it comes out hot, not warm. 
2) The building itself is very old. There are 2 very old and narrow elevators, and 1 updated elevator. If there were ever a fire, I would not expect to get out alive with small elevators and staircase. On several trips in and out there were bags of rubbish in the hall, and several paint cans on a cart. I wouldn't call it unsafe, because it's probably ""grandfathered"" up to code, but it's not nearly as safe as a new hotel in my opinion. 
3) The room keys are sensitive and stop working. During my two days there, my key stopped working, and I saw several other guests having the same problem. 
4) There were no face cloths or hand towels in the room. I left a note for the cleaning staff, and returned to find the note was gone, but no face cloths or hand towels. I then asked at the front desk, and some were quickly sent up. 
5) The room was tiny. Similar to staying on a boat. You have to plan ahead to move around. You won't fit in the room with two large suitcases. 
Summary:
Overall good value for the price and great location. Probably the perfect place to stay after the ball drop on New Years eve, and I promise you'll warm up quickly. I would never consider staying here in the summer. The location and decor were great, but when I travel on business, I don't want to even think about the room, or temperature, or keys, etc. There are so many places to stay in the city.",2.0,4,-2.0
"Excellent location and good value
The Grand Hyatt was recently remodelled and not just the lobby. The rooms, which in my opinion are the most important part were remodled inside and out and are very nice and comfortable. The bathrooms look like something I have only seen in 4 Seasons Hotels and the rooms themselves are very relaxing with warm colors, nice art, 32"" flat panel TV's and comfortable beds and furniture. The service, from folks at the counter, to the valet and just staff walking around the hotel were friendly and very helpful. The location is perfect if you just want to park the car and forget about it. Everything is close, Ruth's Chris & Starbucks are right in the hotel and then you have many top restaurants and stores within a few blocks as well as Pike Street Market. If you can get a room for under $225 I would rate it 5 stars",5.0,4,1.0
"Not Recommended
First of all, let me start by saying that when I received my room confirmation, they mention that the hotel will no longer be managed by Joie de Vivre starting July 1, 2012. Well knowing that, it seems like they have already checked out....
My air conditioner did not work. I went to the front desk and they sent someone up to look at it. I was downstairs and 5 minutes later they came down and said when the technician went up, it was working. I was at a wedding that night and when I returned, the air conditioner was still not working. The room was hot like a sauna and because of the proximity to the freeway it was not an option to leave the balcony door open as it was too loud. I tossed and turned and sweat all night. It was a miserable experience.
In the morning while checking out, I advised the front desk staff, again. They seemed disinterested and basically said ""oh we're sorry"".
In addition, the painting is terrible. The bathroom ceiling paint was peeling, the bathroom door frame looks like it was slapped together by a crappy contractor. The top piece of the frame was off by 2 inches on either side and completely crooked. 
The furniture is nice but the TV is larger than the desk/table so it sits completely in front of the mirror in the room. The closet door had difficulty opening and closing and the bottom drawer where they ""hid"" the safe would unhinge and slam down on my toes every time i opened the closet door.
I'd probably never stay here again. For $200+ a night, I'd expect more. Its right up against the freeway, loud and if its no longer being managed by a supposed ""upscale"" company like joie de vivre, I cant even imagine how bad it would be otherwise...",2.0,1,1.0
"Not worth the money saved.
We were in the city for a bachelorette party and St. Patty's Day. Upon checking in and seeing how TINY the room was, we opted for an upgrade to a king suite because 4 people could hardly even move in the standard room. After being first sent to the wrong room, then sitting on hold with the front desk for 10 minutes, we finally got the correct room. Then on the second night we found a huge cockroach crawling up the wall. When we took it to the front desk, the manager told us that this is 'normal' and that it's because we are in the city. He tried to tell us that all of the hotels in the area actually have cockroaches. (after seeing a room at the Wyndham down the street, I highly doubt that is true) We didn't even want to stay after finding the cockroach but since it was St. Patty's Day, all of the hotels in the area were sold out. The manager did comp us for one night, even though we wanted him to get us a room in a different hotel. I'll never go back to this hotel again and I'm hoping we didn't bring any cockroaches home with us.",2.0,1,1.0

"Little things mean a lot
The location was very good, right across from Nordstroms and Bloomies Home 1/2 block from
Uno's pizza. However it was a nightmare getting into the hotel. The city has given the hotel 
only 3 parking spaces in front to check in and believe me it was a nightmare. The lobby is on the
6 th floor. If the spaces are full you have to keep driving around and around on one way streets
until a space is open. The rooms are small, but the bath with toilet is really huge while the sink
outside of the bath room was very low with very little room to put anything. It was the hieght for
a child. The air conditioning is awful if you are sitting in the tiny area. It blows on you wherever 
you are sitting and last but not least the sheets kept coming off during the night driving us nuts.
It was a fitted bottom sheet but the top and bottom were just too small for the mattress. So you 
can say the little things drove us nuts, the AC, the sheets,parking, check in, were little things
adding up to we probably won't stay there again. I must say in closing that the lead bellman
was a gem. He was soooo pleasant and helpful.",3.0,2,1.0
"Good for a place to sleep and store your stuff...that's it.
Firstly, if you choose to book here and you drive, realize that parking is NOT included in any estimates!! I was very surprised to see an additional $50 added to our bill for two nights parking when I checked out!! :-O
The ventilation in our room was very poor; each time someone took a shower the room became very hot and muggy. We had to open the window ...which did not work very well.
We also found the WiFi coverage very spotty. I could connect with my phone, but only worked for minutes at a time. My friend could not connect at all with his tablet. He was continually asked for a password when the front desk assured me that WiFi was free in the rooms.
The redeeming qualities of this hotel are the staff and the location. Very friendly and helpful staff and we walked around Seattle easily. If that's what you intend to do this hotel will suit your needs. Anything fancier, look elsewhere.",3.0,2,1.0
"Location, location, location!
If you are visiting someone at a nearby hospital or university and you are on a budget, this is the perfect solution. If you are looking for any type of luxury or want to be near fine dining restaurants or night life you are better served staying in the Kenmore Square area. We liked the Commonwealth Hotel, but keep in mind that is a different price point and that you will be about a five to ten minute drive from the hospital. 
The staff at The Best Western was very warm and compassionate, quite adorable in our experience. The rooms are very basic but could be so much better with minor improvements. They could add a few outlets for devices ( or a lamp with the built in outlet), replace broken hangers in closets and install a safe for valuables. 
One of our meals was in the adjacent giant food court serving a wide range of food from Chinese (Bourbon Street) to Middleastern (Sepal). Both were very good, filling and under $10 with a soft drink. The hotel restaurant Longwood was good enough and reasonable. The comp guest continental breakfast was a fruit cup, bagel and coffee. An a la carte menu was available and was good and basic.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Make sure you have a deposit.
My family and I (4 total) stayed at this hotel on 8/23/12. Upon checking in, I not only waited 10 minutes but I was also told that a 25 dollar deposit was needed with my debit card. When I told them I didn't have that in my account, they said they could accept $75 cash. Told her we didn't have that kind of money with us. After talking to the manager, they said it could be waived this time. Our room was on the second floor. Room 211. I looked out the window to see how close we were to the exit ramps but the noise wasn't horrible. Of course, the first thing my kids wanted to do was head to the pool. It was clean but much smaller than it seems. After we were done swimming and went to dinner, we came back to swim some more and then relax in our room. I had just bought a pair of pure white socks and put them on. After walking around for about half an hour, they were filthy on the bottom. At night, the noise was horrible. We barely slept. The breakfast was decent and checkout was easy. Overall, this hotel was definatly not worth the $95 we paid for it. We won't be back.",2.0,3,-1.0

"""Did we stay at the same hotel as the others who rated it so high?""
We were in Chicago for a wedding. We have stayed in many other hotels in the area in the same price range...that were a way better value. This is the smallest room that I have stayed in in the United States in a hotel...it was crazy small. The staff was nice but it was disappointing to have to request that they remove things from my bill that were not to be there (high speed internet). The biggest disappointment was when we returned early from the wedding reception my wife and I were going to sit in the lounge and visit. When I went to the bar to order I was basically harassed for minding my own business by the ""flamboyant"" clientele. When I didn't respond...it was intensified and the manager that walked right through did not seem to care. I don't have any problem with people that live a different lifestyle than me being around but why do they feel the need to harass me and my wife and WHY ON EARTH would the hotel staff put up with it...They are guaranteed to have lost my business.",2.0,1,1.0
"Won't be back.... Try the Holiday Inn
The location is great. You can walk to some really good restaurants. The rooms are nice.
However, the staff is apparently very inconvienced by you being there. Initially, I called to sign up for the ""romance package"" for a weekend getaway. I wanted to ask if I could book the romance package with points or not. ""Keisha"" apparently was having a bad day when she answered the phone. (FYI, you can't.) Apparently, a simple question is met with a massive condescending attitude. 
Since there was no mention of the champagne in the room at check in, I called to ask about it and was again met by the joy that is Keisha. To give you an example of the attitude:
Me: ""I'm calling to ask about the champagne...""
K: (cutting me off) ""We deliver it. Do you want it now?""
Me: ""Well we're going out to eat, I think we'll be back around 8 or 8:30...""
K: (again cutting me off) ""Which is it, 8 or 8:30?"" (once again with her condescending tone...)
We weren't ready to leave for dinner immediately, so we stopped by the executive level for hors d'oeurve. Another example from the lady behind the bar:
Me: ""I'd like a glass of white wine, whatever bottle you have open.""
lady-behind-the-bar: ""You have to pick one."" 
Me: ""How about Chardonnay""
lady-behind-the-bar: *Sigh* *Eye roll* ""You'll have to wait while I go get that"" 
The whole stay reminded me of the old joke, ""this would be a great business if it weren't for the customers...""

We had a wacky itinerary that included a ~9 hrs. overnight layover in LA. This hotel had a free shuttle, and when we checked in, we discovered a really nice clean room.

The bathroom was in horrible condition with dust on every surface and poorly done drywall repairs. The faucets were loose from the wall and didn't help for the best adjustment between freezing cold and scolding hot. We also saw numerous large roaches in our room. The pool is nice, but will never again stay at this location. When I checked out they barely looked up from the computer to take our keys, and was never asked how our stay was.

"Keep Looking
We stayed here the end of August and, after reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I thought we had chosen wisely. Yes, this place has character but not the kind anyone would want. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is in a good location. The carpets look like they were from grandmothers's day. The whole upstairs had a dank smell to it. After getting my shower, I couldn't find the hair dryer. I figured it was just hidden. When I called the desk, they informed me that I could come down there and borrow one. I commented that I was in my pajamas. The desk clerk said that she wouldn't judge me. 
I can't imagine why but they seemed to have a lot of people checking in all the time. We stayed at some reasonably priced hotels in our two week vacation of the Canadian Rockies, Vancouver, Victoria and Seattle, but this one was most memorable and not for a good reason. We couldn't bear to stay in our room at night so we played cards in their courtyard. It, too, needed some TLC but the table was clean.",1.0,2,-1.0

After reading all the negative reviews before our stay, my first thought was it can't be that bad. But it was a dump. I had booked a king, only to be put in a room with a queen.

No towels in the room when we showed up. I called the front desk and eventually approached housekeeping (which was still cleaning rooms at 5pm), but they kept telling me to wait.

The hotel was a chaotic mess as there were 2 conventions at the resort being held that same weekend. We were not able to get the regency rooms that we booked. We were given rooms at the other bldg and upon checking in, found out there were no bath towels in the room. When we called housekeeping, we were told they were understaffed and will get the towels to us in an hour or so. Well, they never came and we never got our towels.

"Room service is too expensive, but front desk staff very nice.
They charge WAY too much for their room service food menu items!!! I had a fleeting thought of ordering something on my last night there, but Noooooooooo way!

I would understand if it had breakfast steaks and other not-so-common items, but it had just bacon, eggs, juices, milk, cereal, danish, biscuits...
I like that they are very Eco-conscious about not wasting water on linens if the same people were going to occupy the one room for more than 1 consecutive day. 
I stayed from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning, with my oldest son...we attended an anime convention that was located at a convention center nearby. Joseph B. was very helpful whenever he was on duty behind the front desk. :-)

"A magical treat!
This was always somewhere I had wanted to stay and worth the splurge! Had a brilliant suite on 39th floor of the Towers part of the hotel and loved being able to treat ourselves. It was really big, with separate lounge, dining room and dressing room as well as of course big bedroom. Bathroom was older style but we felt it was part of the history. We made the most of the suite with room service meals instead of going out - it was too nice to leave! We had a corner suite and the views were magnificent from all rooms.
Only disappointment was breakfast in the executive lounge, we wished we had gone to main dining room. It was small with furniture that was in poor condition and windows were really dirty, spoiling the great view. 
We spent time in the main hotel too and some excellent display cabinets with historical photos etc that are very interesting. We also bought the DVD about the history and it is a great reminder of all the special guests and historical events that have taken place there.

My husband really enjoyed the fitness center.
Only one thing was that our room did not have a safe or anywhere to lock your valuables, you have to go downstairs to leave your things in a locked storage area, and we did not take advantage of that because it was inconvenient.

My family and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott for three nights. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. We had a minor hiccup when we arrived with the room (tried to put my family of four in a room with only one king bed) but this was quickly resolved. 
The room had two queen beds and a pull out couch. This was plenty of room for my family, we did not feel closed in at all. The bathroom is a bit tight, only one person can stand in the bathroom, vanity, closet area at one time. The beds were comfortable and pillows of typical Marriott quality.
I ate at the bistro downstairs one night. The staff was nice and the food great (lobster maccroni was AMAZING). The next morning, I went down for coffee and also had a great experience. Unfortunately after that, they closed the cafe in the mornings for renovations and only offered a sparce continental breakfast out of a conference room for $12.00. I decided to leave the hotel and get my java fix a couple of blocks away. It was more of a nusience than a real complaint.
I ended up spending a lot of time in the lobby in the evening after the children went to sleep and enjoyed the set up. The booths with the televisions was a nice touch.

"Problems problems - no water, no air, no electricity
We stayed at the resort from July 13-July15. The front desk had offered us an upgrade to the 6th floor, which overlooked the spa building, but it was better than being on floors 1-4. Iâll break it down into pros & cons: Room Pros â nice comfortable bed and pillows, spacious rooms, good cleaning service, fragrant soap/shampoo, new looking dÃ©cor Room Cons â even though rooms have been renovated, you can still tell itâs an older hotel, bathroom only have a bathtub, no shower Problems Encountered â Saturday morning â no water from around 10:45 to 12:30pm â without being able to take a shower, we stayed inside until the water came on before we can head out to explore Austin â major inconvenience. Saturday evening (from 6pm to 9:45pm) â no air â the chiller was broken and the whole hotel had no air conditioning. It was hot and humid. Not fun. Sunday morning â the circuit breaker had issues/electricity went out for about a minute â and when electricity went back on â the TV would not work until we left. Major problems that made it inconvenient. The hubby went to the Callaway Performance Center and enjoyed the service there. He played at the Crenshaw course and enjoyed it as well, thought it was pricey for what he got. Dining â went to the bar & grill â the food is expensive. The only dishes we could recommend was the tortilla soup (bowl $8) and the bread pudding (small size for $8). We tried the Hill Country Room for brunch buffet. The cost was $23 dollar per person for total of about $60 since they add automatic 20% resort fee. The brunch was just ok and not worth the $22. Eggs and potato were soggy, waffles too dense, the creamer container was dirty, biscuits were too dense, OJ came from Tropicana bottle (since they placed gallon container on the servicing table).Overall rating â come here if you plan to play golf. But for the price we paid and the major issues with no water, electricity, and air conditioning â we feel it was not worth the price. We were really looking forward to the trip since the other reviews were great and was saddened/disappointed. You would think that a 5 star resort would not have these issues and would try to provide some kind of compensation for the inconveniences that it had caused us.

"Great deal and customer service made this an excellent buy!
From the time of check-in until check out, the service was great and very accommodating. Also, the rooms are clean, large, and have almost everything you need.
Its really nice to have two bathrooms, one with the toilet and the sink, and another with the bath and the sink, however, it would make more sense to me to put the amenities and the hairdryer in the room with the toilet rather than the bath area. This is so that while one person is showering, another person can be drying their hair without getting steamed out. And yes, if you close the door and run the shower, it gets steamy inside the room. Also, it would be nice if they would have put some amenities in the second bathroom so you're not running back and forth between them for stuff. Nitpicky things, but I wish they had a haircover and lotion. I didn't try calling the front desk for it, to see if it was available, but there was a small area for groceries and notions right next to the front desk if you wanted something at any time of the day. 
Beds were comfortable, and I asked for extra pillows and blankets, and only needed the pillows. Since I had recent neck surgery a month before this trip, I wanted extra cushioning and comfortable beds, and this fit the bill. I also asked for and received an accessible room, since I was using a walker, and also needed the railings to help in the bathroom. I also had a cane to get around for shorter distances, and had left my walker at check in, since we were rushing to get to the TGIF at night before it closed (arrived late at night off a delayed flight). Yes, its THAT close. I didn't even need my walker, it was right outside the door, and up the walkway about 25 yards! The check in agent offered to let me keep my things while we ate, so I left the luggage with him. When we came back an hour later, he had already transferred everything up to our room, making it so nice to just get myself upstairs and straight to room right next to elevator. And no, it didn't bother me to have the noise from the elevator, but the doors don't quite meet the rug at the bottom of the doorway, so if you're a light sleeper and sound bothers you, then you have to weigh your decision on whether you want or need to be close to the elevator vs the sound. BUT, there was a very inconsiderate guest across the way from us, who had allowed her kids (5-6 boys) to run around playing outside in the hallways. She brought this portable soccer goal, and they set it up right outside my door and used the long hallway to kick the ball down. I was from the west coast, so while it was about 8:30am, it was 5:30am to me,and we didn't get to sleep til well after 2 am after dinner and showers the night before. I didn't really enjoy being woken up by the sounds of boys kicking a ball around and rustling around by the door. I had opened it and looked at them shaking my head and asked them to move down the hall a bit. They did, but I was now awake, so I decided I might as well go get some treats at the breakfast bar before it closed at 9:30. 
SO, I used my walker knowing it would be easier to carry things in it and walking then to try and balance everything. I found lots of great stuff. They had juice, milk, coffee, danish, waffles, eggs, sausage, fruit cups (sealed) and fruits. I had grabbed plenty of everything, tossing it in the walker, and the girl who refilled the food offered to help me gather things. She noticed I was taking it upstairs to put in the room, and said to use a coffee cup since it was larger and had a cover, and we loaded everything in my walker's bin. I thought it was very considerate of her to help, and to give me the advice, when I knew she was busy. I took enough for me and my daughter, and figured to reheat it in the microwave, and also had the frig for the juice and fruit cups and fruit. My daughter loved having the fruit cups when she woke up while I was heating everything. she didn't care for reheated sausage and eggs, but it worked for me. I didn't bother with waffles, since there was a line and I didn't want to stand there waiting for it with my walker cuz I kinda blocked the area with it. there's not a lot of room to move around, or to sit, so I was actually happy with what I had, and was content to take it upstairs and eat it there. My daughter liked sleeping in, and eating next to the TV, and when i was done, I jumped on the internet and checked mail while she ate. So, everything worked out fine. 
We were there for a sporting meet at the Convention Center, so I chose this location for its proximity to the center, for the lower price. I was very happy with the results. Our friends stayed at the JW, paying about $25 more for the room per night, plus taxes, had no frig or microwave, had to pay for breakfast and all their other food, as well as internet. They were closer to the center, and had a nicer room, but paid the extra money for everything and had 2 kids and could have used the savings of eating reheated food, and had no way of keeping their leftovers cold. We ate at a pizza place called Bazbeaux on Massachusetts Ave, while we went window shopping, and their pizzas were good, but huge, even for a small sized one! So we had tons of pizza left over. I was happy we had the frig and the microwave. But the other family was saying ""hmm, no microwave... oh well, we like cold pizza. But, hmm, we don't have frig either... so I guess we'll have to leave it out."" They thought about opening a window/balcony to put it on to keep it cold but couldn't because the JW is all windows on the outside. LOL We didn't have any problems - so I said I was happy to walk the few extra feet for the other conveniences. And we probably saved at least $100 over them. Oh, if you're walking around on Massachusetts, be sure to keep walking all the way up until you get to the Flying Cupcake! Great big huge red velvet cupcakes for about $3.75 each, about twice the size of the ones I've seen at home in Vegas. And they were good! I wanted to try their chocolate peanut butter ones, but someone right in front of us got the last one. Rats! she said it was one of their more popular flavors, so be sure to go earlier and grab some. Mmm. It cost about $19 for 5 cupcakes, but was our special treat for the day.
Convention Center notes: It was cold at night when the meet was over, but no rain or snow (first week of Jan), so it was nice to have everything covered and inside. BUT, when leaving the convention center, you don't want to be the last ones out, because they lock the doors betw the center and the walkways, and we couldn't get into them and HAD to go outside to cross the street to the JW. It was freezing! But once inside the JW, were able to use the walkways from the JW to Springhill. It was 100+ yds to get to the back entry elevator of the Springhill, but with my walker, I was able to handle it. You're walking the length of the JW's convention area to get to the Springhill. There's a Starbucks too, right at the point of the JW's entrance to the convention center's walkway, so if you want to grab a coffee and munchie before heading in, do so - cuz there's nothing inside the center except expensive concessions that were down the hall from our event. (another 50-75 yds! no thanks, the coffee/hot chocolate and scones worked fine) 
We brought our ipod touch for communication since I couldn't carry the weight of my computer around with me this trip. I basically wanted to be able to access the internet for convenience, and check emails and post on Facebook. The Ipod did everything, and they had an ipod recharger unit on the radio. Wow, talk about convenience. Glad I brought the charger tho, cuz their radio unit wasn't charging it very well. But if you just need wireless internet for simple things, wow, the ipod touch saved me a lot of weight and extra gear i couldn't afford to bring. My 11 yr old daughter had to carry everything, so I definitely needed a hotel with services, and understanding staff, and I had to plan well. Since I did, and the staff was great, my trip was an easy one, and i couldn't ask for more. (except for the same inconsiderate guest - she let her boys play in front of my room again the second morning, even earlier. My guess is that the guests down the hall complained, so they moved their game in front of my door, extending it in the other direction towards the elevator. If you came off the elevator, you'd be greeted by nerf soccer balls and kids using the elevator area as the other goal. When I looked out my door, the mom was just packing stuff up and had her door open, so I commented with a ""really? two mornings in a row? cmon..."" and the boys said ""oh, sorry"" and continued to play. The mom said ""they said they're sorry..."" and let them continue. No apologies from her, no ""boys, you need to play quietly, or stop."" So, I decided to call the front desk and ask them to do something. They apologized, and i told them they didn't need to cuz its not the hotel's fault, they just needed to make them stop. I also told them itd be best to send someone up to see what the kids were doing. It took less than 5 minutes before that game was shut down. I was so tired, and being woken up so early again, I was pretty mad, so I called the front desk and asked if I could have an extra hour to get myself together and sleep for just a few more minutes. He said if its only an hour, then that was fine. The extra hour was plenty, I just needed a little buffer, because I couldn't get everything packed that fast. When I checked out a couple hours later, the front desk asked if it had quieted down, or if there was any more trouble, and I said no. The front desk service was obviously very attentive, and knew exactly who was calling in, and remembered me, and asked if my stay was OK. Yes, it was - thanks to them. So, give them a chance to correct things, and I'm sure you'll have a great stay. 
BTW if you need a taxi, check online and get the phone number into your cell phone ahead of time. When you call them you can mention you saw their online ads for $25 to/from the airport, and that's what they'll charge, instead of $35+ for traffic and stops and mileage... I saved more than $10 one way, compared to our friends, who just caught the first taxi in the taxi line. But planning it next time, I'll call ahead a few minutes to allow for the guy to get there, because they needed 15-20 minutes to get to the airport, they weren't already there, and you don't catch the taxi in the same place - you need to walk further to another place to catch an arranged taxi ride. Our friend asked me how I got the deal, and wanted to do it going home.. and one driver warned her that you can't just hop in any taxi and say you want to pay $25. So he gave our friends the phone number so she could call for a return ride to the airport. It's also $5 for a ride anywhere within the downtown area - but some taxis charge extra if you have 5 people like we did since we traveled as a group and caught it outside the JW front lobby to Massachusetts Ave. BUT I used my taxi service phone # to arrange our return ride back, and he charged me $5 - no extra. if you're travelling with a limited budget, you can appreciate the savings, wherever they are.
Hope this is helpful to other travelers, because I really relied on other comments to help plan my trip. If you're traveling following a surgery, sometimes you just need a little extra TLC and can really appreciate it when someone offers the little extras without having to ask for them or charge for every little thing you need, and that's how the Springhill Suites was. I can't guarantee everyone would receive extra service, but if you ask nicely, I'm sure if they can, they will. Also, I booked this trip early, but I'm a Marriott member, and received a notice that there was sale pricing at the hotel a few days before my trip, so I asked if I was able to change my reservation without losing my accessible room. Marriott made the change, and I got an additional discount, so instead of paying the regular $123 rate (AAA member price), I got the same room for about $103 per night. I saved about $50 for the weekend last minute because of the sale. So keep checking up to the time you travel, you might still find better rates if you're wanting to save a few bucks.",5.0,4,1.0

"Front desk staff needs retraining!
Every year I stay for 3 nights at this hotel. The only reason theyÂ´ve kept me as a client for so many years is that my other option is the Westin Galleria or stay outside the Galleria. This time around I thought they might get a better review, the hotel has finally upgraded their elevators to the intelligent ones, and this has made the service much more efficient... Until they stop working on a Sunday morning and people had to use the service elevators or the stairs, the hotel didnÂ´t provide any information to their guests, luckily we were on the 5th floor and were not checking out.
Last year the shower in my room didnÂ´t work, this year it was the safe. The security staff that had to come in to fix it, was really apologetic, the problem was complicated, it took 4 visits to get it to work properly... My huge complaint is the customer service Westin Oaks provide through service express, no matter how big or small the business, you should always listen to the client. If IÂ´m paying for a service I expect to receive a comprehensive replay like ""we are doing everything we can to solve the problem, we are very sorry for the inconvenience"" and offer a solution, later I learned that they have safes downstairs for cases like this. The response I received from Service Express on Friday night was ""what would you like me to do? I canÂ´t do anything, and donÂ´t talk to me like that"" (my tone was firm, asking for a quick solution).
The Westin Oaks provide good rooms, itÂ´s clear to me that IÂ´m paying for the location, but I donÂ´t know how they are keeping their star rating. Any staff member that interacts with clients must be patient, they are representing the company, in this case Westin Oaks is showing not only a lack of supervision of their maintenance (also the towels were torn), also a lack of customer service training.",3.0,2,1.0

Unfortunately, the walls of the hotel are incredibly thin -- we could hear every single word our neighbors were saying.

Called the front desk again and they had no record of my first call and I asked for the manager and after being put on hold for 3-4 minutes I talked to the manager who told me the tech had gone home and I could either move rooms or make due. After asking if this is how they run their campsite, I was offered a trivial amount SPG points. I told them they should never insult someone with such small recompense for forcing a guest to sit in their room and stare at 4 walls.

"Be prepared!
I stayed at the Hotel Whitcomb for a week for work. This wasn't out of choice - my work booked me in there and it was conveniently close to the office. Like you're doing now, I always check Trip Advisor for impartial reviews on hotels so I wanted to do some research before I came out. 
So, here is my personal take on the hotel:
Location:
Whilst convenient for work, I was a lone female traveller visiting the city for the first time. Everyone talks about this hotel being convenient for Union Square etc...but my advice? Go to a hotel near Union Square. This area is rated as the 'grittiest' area of San Francisco - be prepared to see lots of homeless people scattered outside the hotel. I am a city girl, born and raised in London but even the concierge told me not to walk around the area on my own at night and only some areas were 'ok' in the day time! Not the most confidence-inspiring thing to be told on arrival. So, even though the Bart is literally outside the hotel I didn't want to take my chances so I took a taxi everywhere. There is nothing noteworthy to see in the immediate surroundings of the hotel although there is a theatre nearby if you are planning on watching a play.
Hotel
A historic hotel this may be but it needs some serious updating. Yes, the lobby is grand and inviting. Yes, the staff are pleasant enough but the rooms are dated and need a good lick of paint, an updated heat/ventilation system and bathrooms need to be ripped out. One word of advice here: book a king room. At least you get the space and a big bed (which, by the way are comfortable). The bathroom ventilation system is so loud you may be tempted not to switch the light on and the bath was so stained and uninviting you would rather just have a shower. Note: even though the shower temperature indicated 'hot' when you turned the dial to the left, I discovered the only way to get hot water was to turn the dial to 'cold' and wait at least 5 minutes to get hot water. There is no safe in the room which I would have assumed would be a standard requirement? Don't expect room service as they do not offer this. Another word of advice: bring your own shower gel as they only provide soap. I was on the 2nd floor and my room faced the back of the hotel - I was relieved as I had read reviews that the front of the hotel facing Market Street was too noisy. Relieved until at 1am in the morning I heard a truck loading and unloading towels til 2.30am in the morning. This happened 3 nights out of my 6 night stay! Also be prepared for a stale, old smell in the hallways and the bedrooms. 
If you don't mind staying in a basic hotel and you are prepared to be in a less than attractive area than this hotel will fulfil your needs. The concierge are very friendly and always hailed a taxi for me - I also felt safe once inside the hotel.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Excellent location and service
I stayed at the Westin Times Square while on a week vacation in NYC in August 2012. My experience and recommendation can be described by the below:
Location
The hotel is definitely at one of the best locations you can stay at in NYC. Located in the heart of midtown it is exactly at times square with all major attractions and entertainment facilities located in a radius of 2 to 3 blocks: 5th avenue for example is only 3 blocks away while avenue of the Americas is 2 blocks down. 
As soon as you step out of the main entrance, you are on 8th avenue, 43rd street just seconds away form a variety of restaurants and bistros from all around the world. (Shake Shack is just in front....just cross the road).
Furthermore, the hotel is at really close distance from all artistic attractions of Broadway. the Minksof theater where Lion King is playing is just two blocks ahead and all other theaters at a walking distance. The Intrepid museum is on 12th avenue accessible on foot or 5 minutes by cab including the NYC traffic.
The hotel really has one of the best locations to be in while ""touristing"" in NYC.
Hotel and rooms
The building is really nice both on the outside and on the inside. Main entrance on 8th avenue is lavish and holds the security and baggage claim desks. A large escalator takes you all the way up to a grand front desk and concierge services as well as a really cozy and elegant seating area. The experience starts really well at the hotel the minute you step inside the lobby.
The hotel also has another entrance from 42nd street which is equally nice.
Rooms are quite large and very well decorated. I was in a two double bed that was very spacious and really comfortable. It was on the 24th floor boasting a great view on the Hudson river and the surrounding area. The bathroom is neatly decorated and equipped with all services you would expect.
The only drawback is that on some floors the halls are a little complex and intertwine with one another. Halls are all greyish so some light or colors might make things look way better. But it is not a note that will push you away from the hotel, it is just a small note I picked up while there.
Service
Service at the Westin can't be described by nothing other than just perfect. You are greeted with a beautiful smile that makes you feel welcome every single step of the way. I would like to extend the best compliments to ""Sarah"" at front desk who was just wonderful in making the check in process one of a kind knowing that my room was not available at time of check in. She was really great in the way she reassured me and greeted me at the premises. I truly recommend that you ask for her if you check in at the Westin.
As for room service and house keeping, they are also very nice. I have been provided with all my requests and more by really great personnel who never refrained from being there whenever they were needed.
Security and bell boys are extremely helpful, they were great in helping me with directions and booking of cars and taxis. 
Service at the Westin is one of the best I have ever experienced in a high end hotel 
Prices
Well to be honest it is not a cheap hotel. I ended up paying USD 370 a night and that was a discounted rate. But I think it is a perfectly explained price for such a hotel, location and time of the year (high season). It is really worth every penny.
I strongly recommend the Westin times Square for your next stay in NYC.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Royalton NYC
Nice boutique hotel in a great location. The bar, lounge is awesome with great service. It is a dark place and the rooms don't have good lighting - which is ok with me. The only negative I have is that I upgraded to a business package deal to get 1) an upgrade to the room 2) passes to Equinox gym 3) free breakfast and 4) free wi fi for a higher price. I didn't really care about the wi fi and am not a breakfast person but I was excited to try the Equinox nearby and get a room upgrade. The person at the front desk didn't even know I had upgrade to this particular package..... I had to tell her and then when she looked at the computer she seemed to know. She promptly gave me my passes to Equinox and my breakfast vouchers. 
Unfortunately there was no room upgrade. I specifically asked her what time I could use the breakfast vouchers and she said 8-12, When I went down at 11:15 day 2 they said the voucher was only good until 11a. Oops. They were nice enough to rebound and make accomodations for her misinformation and I got a nice breakfast.
The Bose system also did not work in the room and i had no music to listen to. When I called to ask if I was doing something wrong to engage it, I was told ""i'll call you back"" and got no call back.
Overall the room was ok for NYC and the location was good and the gym was sufficient. I would say the the bar/restaurant staff make this place one to go back to.",3.0,4,-1.0

Beware of the cheap price and the rather stylish exterior as that is about the only 'good' at this place.

We were brought a chair and I wouldn't even allow a street person to sit on it as it had very unpleasant stains on it. Apparently another traveler also had to ask for a chair - hmmm - chairs aren't that expensive to have in a standard room are they? Oh yes, forget the 'supposedly' free wi-fi - you have to pay for that service even if you have your own computer. I can understand paying at the some of the high-end resorts, but come on, even Motel 6 offers free wi-fi.

"Neverending Disappointment
We booked this hotel for a 4 night stay following our wedding. The price was great. The location is also fabulous. Some of the negatives are par for the course in Chicago, like outrageous parking fees ($50/day) and overly busy lobbies without any friendly greeting. Ok. Whatever. 
We got up to the room, a junior corner suite, and were very excited about the great view (again, great location). Then we noticed that the AC in the bedroom wasn't working. In the midst of July on a high floor with giant windows, this was very obvious. It was already late, so we decided to try to sleep and called the next morning. This began a series of 6 phone calls and trips to the front desk requesting that it be fixed. The first technician they ""sent"" never came. The second tried his best to fix the problem but failed. The third rudely walked into an overheated room, looked at the AC, said it was working and left. We also had technicians supposedly arrive while we were out, but there was no note and no evidence that anything had been fixed. This happened over about 36 hours. 
By the 2nd night, we asked to be moved, and they assured us it would be to an equal room. It wasn't. We were moved from a 3 room junior suite in decent condition to a horrible executive room with wires poking out everywhere, holes in the wall, ripped base board and a THREE INCH gap under the door. That AC also was not cooling very well. This was at 1:00am. We requested to be moved back to the hot room as it was less disgusting. The night manager offered a complimentary breakfast (which is a $19 blah continental thing); nice but it did not fix anything. 
Now back in the original room, we also mentioned that the shower/tub did not drain. Every time we showered, the water rose above our ankles and puddled. Essentially, we were showering in the filth of everyone who had stayed there before. We called. No maintenance came. We spoke to someone again, finally a man arrived, and pulled out a little hair (only spent about 60 seconds ""unclogging"" the drain) and then poured a bit of drain chemicals in and left. Needless to say, it didn't work. So the third night we attempted to shower, found that we were still standing in a puddle of filth and now chemicals. We requested to change rooms. 
The 3rd room was the actual equivalent room - a corner junior suite. It was fine. The AC worked. The shower drained. Too little too late. 
We had high hopes. I'm sure other people have had lovely stays here. The location is the only true pro. It was not worth the low price we paid, and we will gladly pay more to stay somewhere else the next time we visit Chicago. This is the one and only time we will stay in this hotel.

"A little pricey for what you're getting, but not bad at all.
I was in Boston for only one night and was sharing the room with 2 other people, which is what made the $200 a night price tag palatable. This was the best and most affordable hotel available on short notice and we were not disappointed.
That being said, if I was travelling by myself (which I do often) or staying multiple nights, I could probably find something a little bit further away at a lower price, that is of equal quality.

As seasoned travelers, we know what to expect with different star ratings in the US. Most sites list this hotel as a 3 or 3 1/2 star rating. Not so.

We changed rooms. The bathroom was so tiny the commercial toilet had to sit at an angle. We had no hot water in the shower the first morning (an incorrectly set valve was the diagnosis) and the maintenance worker apparently stole the tip we left for the maid as it disappeared before the room was made up. The lamp shades were torn and the shower curtain had holes. Our bathtub was never cleaned during our three night stay and the toiletries only replenished on the last night despite the fact they were empty after the first (four of us in the room). We had to request additional towels every day even though they were well aware there were four of us in the room, and we were never supplied a bath mat.

"Mediocre
I stayed at The Manhattan Hotel while traveling on business, and I chose this hotel for two reasons â (1) it was three blocks from the office, and (2) it was a Starwood category 5 hotel, which I assumed would translate to a certain level of quality and service. The location is great â close to work, and in the heart of mid-town, but I was unimpressed with the hotel. The rooms were small and dingy (even though I was given a corner room being a SPG Platinum), housekeeping did not put things back in place, no club / lounge, no in-room wireless (so much for free wireless for SPG Platinum members!), no newspaper delivered to the room â I could go on and on. On the plus side, I did receive free continental breakfast (although this was a SPG benefit, not a hotel one), but the restaurant took 10 minutes to get me a cup of coffee and Iâm still waiting for the glass of water! It appears that the SPG category 5 rating is purely based on how much the property can charge for a standard room.
I wouldnât recommend this hotel for folks traveling for leisure / personal reasons (unless you can snag a room at a really low rate) and definitely not for a business traveler. Stay at the Sheraton New York across the street â it costs the same, but the service is better.",3.0,2,1.0
"Not a 5 Star Property
I thought the site of the Hotel was not optimum, seeming to be in a sleezier part of SFO. We were bombarded by pan handlers on the street. Hilton calls this property ""Hilton on Union Square"" It is not. It's four blocks from Union Square. The cafe, Urban Tavern was very hard surface, and uninviting. While the breakfast was exceptional, we spent no other time there.
My wife and I stay at 5 star hotels, and I am a Hhonors Diamond. We expected this to be in that category. It wasn't. The room in Tower 1 4272 was nice, but a very ordinary hotel room. No robe available in the room, which is a mistake.
Despite the Front Desk accommodations to our needs, I feel this is not a property that we will return to, despite being a HHonors Diamond.",4.0,2,2.0
"great apartment, depressing decor
The hotel : apartment style hotel with daily service, very functional, fast lifts, very old fashioned & tired looking decor through out the hotel, small hideous lobby.
The location : between 2 & 3 avenue & 39 st., not too far but not very near Grand central subway, average New York City looking area, not a lot of shops or restaurants around but there's 24hr convenient store around the conner.
The check-in & check-out : fast, accurate.
The breakfast : no.
The room : very big for NYC, very clean, nice small kitchen, the bed is incredibly comfortable, the decor is very old fashioned & deeply depressing, very bad lighting, the air con works OK but a bit loud, big window but no nice view. My room was surprisingly quiet.
The bathroom : very small for such a big apartment, very clean, water pressure is great, very minimal amenity, again, depressing decor.
The staffs : capable & friendly.
The rate : quite a bargain for NYC, especially for a big party.
The Internet : it's one of those hotels from 19th century where you have to pay for Internet.
Overall : it's a very good choice for a NYC hotel if you don't want to spend an outrageous rate for a small room, I probably stay here again despite the depressing decor.",4.0,3,1.0
"Be Aware Before You Book This Hotel
I was on a business trip in April 2012. I have rarely had a bad experience with any Marriott property. I was in for a huge surprise when I arrived at this hotel. Upon checkin I noticed the hotel was not very clean in the halls and elevator. When I stepped off on my floor there was dirty linens piled up all over the floor to which I had to navigate my way through to my room. Ipon arriving in my room I realized they gave me a room with 2 queen beds instead of a king. I started to unpack when I went to use the bathroom only to find a broken toilet. When I went back downstairs there was no apology just simply giving me another room with 2 queen beds. When I arrived to that room it was very musty smelling and appeared to have not been rented in some number of days. I went back downstairs and again no apology therefore I checked out and went to the full service marriott which was outstanding. This Courtyard is a very big disappointment.",1.0,2,-1.0

Don't let the address fool you. This is by no means a Hilton property. Once we checked in, I had maintenance in my room 3 times. Once for the TV remote, but twice for the lock on the door.

I had 3 boys there for a wrestling tournament who were trying to get some sleep. The place was dirty and not very well kept up. The water part was ok. We were also told not to go outside after dark - too dangerous. We will never go there again.",1.0,2,-1.0

"Gerry M - Disappointing
Situated in a nice part of New York, 40 minutes walk from Times Square, 10 minutes from Central Park. Front door staff were very nice. However, the Lobby was very small. The free upgrade offered when we booked was a waste of time as the room we booked for the amount of occupants could not be upgraded, so why offer it? The hotel was covered in scaffolding which further limited the light in the already dark rooms. The building site opposite the hotel was very noisy with work starting at 7am each week-day. We discovered on our return that we had lost two items of property during our stay and despite emailing the hotel twice, they have not responded. The showers were very tempermental in that the sink tap had to be run first to gain any hot water in the shower, we were shown this tip by a member of staff. Not enough wardrobe space for a family of four. Will definitely visit New York again but nfortunately will not stay here.",3.0,2,1.0

"Another Consistent Courtyard Stay
In Charlotte for a family function, selected this hotel as it was near the event. Since it is corporate park area it probably caters more to the business traveler, however, it also works well for the family and we got a decent weekend rate.
PROS:
*Great, functional, cool, remodeled lobby. 
*Awesome staff. I only dealt with the from desk but they were extremely friendly, professional and accommodating.
*Free wireless and wired internet. They also provide some desktops in the lobby for printing boarding passes, looking up email, etc. if you don't have one with you. 
*Nice walking trails in the area (they are in a business area with lots of high rises but well manicured and kept up). Some of the pics I have seen make it look more ""nature/natural"" than it is but I got a decent run and there are mileage markers. 
*Workable fitness room. New equipment, clean. Two treadmills, one elliptical and some weights. They provide water, towels and headphones which I always appreciate. 
*Lots of restaurants in the area to try out as well as some good shopping.
*Good work area in room, comfy bed, decent tv's with a good variety of stations. Mini-fridge was in my room which I like. 
*Room noise was average. I didn't hear much noise from neighbors, halls or street (a little but not bad). 
*Free plentiful parking. 
*Year-round indoor pool and spa. Not huge but nice. 
*Great outdoor deck we took advantage of.
*Free coffee in the AM (but keep in mind, Courtyards are not free-breakfast like some of the other properties these days). 
*Room sizes are good. Can spread your legs a bit. 
Things to Consider:
*Restaurant is limited. Basic selections, fair prices and limited hours but they do offer cocktails and a breakfast and dinner seating (casual). 
*Bathroom was clean but plain. All in working order but nothing fancy. 
*Rooms have the old style A/C/Heat units that can be loud, not really complaining, this is true in a lot of hotels but can take getting used to to fall asleep. 
* A little congested during the week (business area) so plan accordingly if commuting somewhere. 
* Some rooms (I think suites) come with a balcony, so if you want one, probably need to request and/or pay for it. 
*The back side of the hotel faces a man - made pond with a fountain and other offices. The front-side faces a gas station, strip mall and freeway. 
Overall, it was what I expect of Marriot, consistent service, quality and price.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Close to Central Park But Front Desk Needs Coaching
Myself and some friends visited New York City during Labor Day Holiday weekend and stayed at the Milburn Hotel. My travel agent took care of our reservation and recommended The Milburn after explaining to her that we wanted a budget friendly yet, nice place stay for the weekend. I love her recommendation as it was a great choice! We had a suite which nicely accommodated myself and three friends. The suite came with 2 twins and a full size sofa bed. We requested a rollaway with our travel agent who made sure our request was filled and even called while we were there to make sure. The hotel is very nice and close to Central Park and the train station that takes you right to Times Square. Getting around was a breeze literally! Also, the hotel offers FREE breakfast daily and there are kitchenettes in the rooms. SUPER PLUS.
While I really enjoyed my stay, I will admit that, the front desk, including the manager could use attitude ajustments. But after putting them in place, I had no more problems. 
Over all, I would recommend this hotel if you are open to living like the locals and don't mind walking and taking public trans. While these reviews are meant to help guide us and give tips and advise, remember too, that this is based on my experience and yours could be a lot better!",3.0,4,-1.0
"Nice hotel - have stayed here over 20 times
I travel to Dallas often on business, and always stay here. It can be a bit difficult to find and get to for the first-timer, as there is a maze of traffic and highways right at the property. Once you get the hang of it then it's OK. The underground parking is nice, especially during the summer. But beware the low clearance! A rental SUV I once had barely got in. The hotel itself is relatively old, but the lobby area was renovated two years ago. The suites themselves are nice, a flat screen TV in each room. My only nitpick is that the shower glass wall doesn't protrude far enough out so you have to make sure you lay a towel on the floor next to the shower. Even then, the towel will soak. The shower itself was very refreshing. The WiFi was good enough to do my work. I also was able to Skype back home, as well as watch Netflix. Speed tests showed about 1.5 mbps down as well as up. The complimentary breakfast was very good. You can get omelets and such cooked to order, or go straight to the buffet for some of the usual breakfast fare. The manager's reception was OK, although the snack table was rather pedestrian, with just some corn chips, dip, and pretzels, and the like. (But there was one pimento-type dip that was beyond awesome). Free beer is always good! The staff without exception was very courteous, cheerful, and helpful.

I have to admit that I came to stay here as a 'freeby' â given away with an airline promotion. Knowing nothing about the place, I was extremely surprised and pleased that it was situated next to the Natural History Museum, and almost overlooking Central Park. It is an older style hotel nicely renovated, but no frills. My room did not come anywhere near the typical American size â just a Queen bed, small but adequate bathroom, work space and wardrobe. Only complaint that the A/C is very antiquated; either full on or off, even after two complaints. However, the fact that one can walk to half dozen museums, and chose between two subway and three bus lines to get around compensates for that. A relatively nice midtown area, several reasonably priced good quality small restaurants and coffee bars nearby complete the picture.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Not a good experience
I did not enjoy the Hilton Austin and was very unhappy with the service. When I first checked in, I noticed that the minibar was locked. I had to call the front desk and get a key. This surprised me, as I think they would make it easier for me to give them my money. I asked to have it refilled each day, and in the course of the week, they refilled it once. I checked back in a week later, and again asked them at the front desk to please refill my mini bar each day. They told me I needed to call on the phone, not tell them in person. Seriously?
I also realized I was overpaying, as I have a corporate rate I didn't know about. They told me they couldn't apply it, even though I was planning to stay there each week for a couple of months.
In addition, the cafe is closed for renovations. They set up a small table with juice, muffins, etc. in the lobby, and when I approached the cashier, she looked at me and just walked away without saying a word.

Make no mistake, this is a very tired property. The only reason we were forced to take stay at this hotel is the airline cancelled our planned PM flight out of SFO one week before our arrival.

It also reeked of something (and we are not sure what it was) but I don't think it was history.The bathroom was very small and only had a small shower. It is located on a major thorough fare but there are only 2 restaurants close by. Mel's Dive -In and Tommy's Joynt. The neighborhood is sketchy and dirty. Since our choice was a last minute selection the room had to be prepaid with no refund.

"Beautiful place, but . . .
Beautiful place, great setting, nice amenities, friendly staff, but with some very basic issues.
First, we didn't get the room we asked for â I was told the room I reserved (Marina View King) had nobody above us, but the room we got (#152) did have someone above us, and the insulation was so bad we could hear everything they said or did, even sliding their closet door open & shut!
After two days we switched rooms to one with nobody above us (Marina View King #139) and had no hot water (got luke-warm after running water for 15 to 20 minutes), was told by maintenance that, ""Yeah, we get some complaints from down here 'cause it's so far from the water heater"" ?????? 
The king beds in both rooms were lumpy and unsupportive, felt like they were years past needing replacement (""bowed"" or sunk-in at hip level).
I must say, however, that the desk staff did their best to resolve the issues and were extremely caring and courteous, and gave me 1/2 off the last two nights because of the hot water situation. So not a total loss, but the maintenance issues (beds, sound insulation & hot water) leave me feeling that the ""ambience"" promised more than the reality delivered.

We chose the Surrey for our four-night visit to Manhattan in March, and were glad we did. Our choice was based on reading dozens of reviews, tips on ""trevelers room preferences"", and on the bad experience during our last trip in 2004 when we chose a mid-level hotel in the East 50s. After three nights in a noisy, overheated room with no temperature controls, sleep deprivation ruined our visit and made us decide not to return to the city any time soon.
Reading reviews made clear that location matters, that we would have to look at luxury as well as mid-range hotels, and that even then there were no guaranteed of a quiet night's sleep.Fortunately, after a room change, we found a quiet, comfortable room. No noise from inside or outside, excellent bed, handy temperature control. Other reviewers often note the Surrey's skillful and friendly service, upscale ambience, spotless rooms, luxury bedding, and excellent location. We agree with them. A few even mention good sleep and provide tips for finding the quietest rooms.

"cleanliness & upkeep need much improvement
We extended a business trip there for some much needed R & R .Our rate therefore was very good.
The resort itself is beautiful. However, upkeep is not pristine, for example all the flower pots had dead flower, the jets in the hot tub worked sporadically, the rail coverings to the hot tub were torn & frayed etc.
On our third morning we had breakfast on the couch where we had last had dinner the first night. We noticed the floor between the couch & table had crumbs & some food dropping from that r meal 2 days earlier. I called housekeeping. Returning later in the day the room looked & smelled clean. But when I bent n to pick up an earring i dropped at my dresser I found bobbie pins & dirt. I called again & received excuses. 
We were exhausted at our first spa & gym visit & were not looking to be picky. By our third workout I noticed the dirt on the machines I had previously seen was still there. I called this to the spas attention. Two days latter I was appalled that the same dirt was still there & told a manager. She did nothing about it at all other than stand around for over an hour & chat with 2 other gym/spa employees about selling memberships to the resort/gym. 
Of course I was now very aware of the level cleanliness so when I entered the spa toilets it was very obvious that the grout was filthy, especially in front of the toilets. I didn't bother to tell anyone as it was obvious the manger did not care.

"Overall, not a bad place to spend a week for camp
We stayed here because kids were in chess camp and were given a decent group rate. We had a one bedroom suite and for the most part met all our needs. We stayed for 8 nights. This is the first time we stay with this chain. Room was clean upon check in, but that was the last time it was clean. According to their site, they do minimal cleaning(I would imagine take out garbage, clean towels, etc) however that only happened once on Friday, two days before our check out. I talked to the person in charge of our room on Monday since we had been there since Saturday. She said she would handle it. Left in the morning, saw cleaning of other rooms, came back after noon, nothing. Talked to the housekeeping supervisor while I was getting breakfast the next day. Came back, to room, left to drop kids off, stayed out till after noon, again nothing. Talked to Manager on Friday. He signaled to the same supervisor I had spoken to Monday and said, sure we will clean your room, ""You always have your do not disturb sign on when we are cleaning"" end quote. No apologies, nothing. Well, I see you every morning, you are right there, how about mentioning that you can clean now, or even asking if I want the room cleaned, or even offer clean towels. Just left Homewood Suites and even though we had our sign up, they would come back and either ask if we wanted the room clean or offer/leave clean towels. That is the difference between chains and that is the difference and reasons why I keep going back to Homewood Suites. We always travel and stay for extended stays. Breakfast was good, if not running out of their food items, cups, lids, etc. Evening reception more geared to business than families. If you were not there by 5 on the dot, forget getting a table or even a good selection of food, let alone a glass of wine. One day, my kids saw the popcorn machine, my kids were thrilled. We asked the front desk person and she said, no there is no popcorn. Manager left and not sure where it was. She must have felt quilty after she saw the disappointment in my kids faces because she called our room 15 minutes later and said that she finally found it.

"Great Hotel and Great Location
Travelling on my own I chose the New York Palace after a recommendation by a friend and stayed here for a week over the Memorial Day holiday. Hotel was fantastic more than I had expected. The staff at reception were very nice and helpful and checkin quick and all done with a smile. Requested the use of a kettle for my stay and it was delivered to my room and had it for the duration of my holiday. All the staff I came into contact with during my stay were very welcoming and happy to help which seemed the opposite to some of the reviews of the hotel.
The rooms are big in comparision to some hotels I've stayed in in New York. Huge king size bed, a big flat screen tv, not that I watched much on it as was busy seeing the city. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was great, lots of power and hot. Loved the makeup mirror and the nice Molton Brown toiletries. Room was very clean and bed turned down every night and 2 little chocolates left to enjoy. Loved the big safe as i could keep my ipad in it along with some expensive gifts. I did not use the mini bar or any of the drinks or food on top of cabinet as I knew they would be very expensive but with a Duane Reade drugstore 2 blocks away I got water, food and some toiletries I needed. 
The lobby area was always busy with people on their laptops, ipads and phones. It was a nice area to sit in and email family & friends but why not just give you it free in your room? Did not need to use the concierge as been to NYC so many many times and know it well but heard them giving out help and information to many guests and was amazed at there knowledge.
I had a room at the back of building on 15th floor with a view out to Park Ave which was fine as only spent time in the room to bring back my shopping/gifts and to sleep. it was a very nice quiet floor. I was on the side where the large crane was for most of my week stay and I never heard any noise from the work being done neither late into the night or early morning. There was a Starbucks opposite the entrance and every morning I headed down there for breakfast of a peach melba/granola pot and muffin all for around 8 dollars and well worth it, breakfast was just too expensive to eat in the hotel.
The hotel location was perfect, Madison Ave and 50th/51st Streets and one block to 5th Ave. I had all the shops I wanted so close to hand. Plenty of places to eat all so close to hand. I found Bills Bar & Burger Bar close to the Rockefeller Centre and it was a great place to eat in. The food was fantastic, it was on 51st St just off 5th Ave.
On the day I was checking out I had a late flight and asked if there were restrooms I could use to freshen up and was told I could use the showers and facilities in the fitness and spa centre as it was all complimentary. It was great as it was a hot humid day and around 5pm I was able to shower, freshen up my hair and change into my clothes for flight home. I thought this was a nice little perk for guests. Also on that day one of the porters was a real gent (unfortunately I cannot remember his name, very tall guy late 50's early 60's) I have a joint problem with one of my elbows and he very nicely weighed my case with travel scales I'd brought with me.
The New York Palace is a great hotel and if I can get as good a room rate as I had for this holiday on the next one then I will definitely be back. I've recommended it to all my family and friends and hopefully will return next time with my hubby.",4.0,5,-1.0

The air unit had no knobs on it, the cover was on crooked and it vibrated so badly that we had to turn it off. We found a knob in the unit after removing the cover. We had to go to three ice machines before we found one that was working. One of the fire doors was missing the knob and my husband could not get out of the stairwell. Some of the fire alarms are just hanging off of the walls. Our room door is splintered on the edge and looked like it had been kicked in before. There is a deadbolt in the door, but no knob to turn it.",2.0,1,1.0
"Good service but was eaten alive by bedbugs!!!!
We stayed here for one night ths weekend and we were happy with our stay up until the end. The hotel staff allowed us to check in early as we were extremely tired after our 10 hour coach trip, which was really good service. Room fine although did smell a bit smokey, opened the window though and then it was fine. Bathroom clean room basic but fine. Now for the bad news, The next day I began itching and my legs and arms were, and still are covered in huge, swollen bite marks. I could not of got these anywhere else as I wore jeans whilst outside and a jacket. The only time my legs were exposed were in the bed. We stayed in room 1020 so do beware of this room.

"Noisy night
We stayed at the Sheraton Brookhollow in Houston after a family member's wedding. The hotel has been recently redecorated, and the staff was nice. But the location is less than desireable. The hotel sits at the intersection of two of Houston's busiest freeways, and rooms facing the front of the hotel are especially noisy. There is construction along the feeder road in front of the Sheraton, so getting in and out can be tricky if you don't know Houston traffic patterns very well. The rate was reasonable; this seems to be the hotel of choice for church groups, family reunions and business people. You'll need a car since there are no restaurants within walking distance.",3.0,2,1.0
"Sleep is hard to come by at this property
This is a stylish hotel with a pleasant modern vibe, but I also like to be able to get some sleep at a hotel. A nearby bar plays loud music with a heavy base until 2:00 am on Friday and Saturday nights. I think its the same kind of music the CIA plays for several hours to get its prisoners to break, if not they should use the technique. Obviously not the experince I was looking for in San Diego. 
The hotel did tell us at check in that it "" gets very loud in the area around the hotel on Friday and Saturday"" and that can not move you to another room in the hotel because its loud everywhere. While I appreciate the heads up it would have been really good to know before I booked the room not after I am already standing in the lobby. 
If you plan to party past 2:00am every night then his hotel is a good fit. For those of us who stopped doing that after college though stay somehwere else .",2.0,3,-1.0
"A motel with no proper managment and rooms that do not worth the price
I wished if I meet the manager to discuss with the following poits:
1. despite the good location, the rooms and services do not worth the price,
2. The bathtub sink doesnt work well despite and those who clean the room know it since they notice the remants of very slow drainage. they may didnt report it or the manager does not inspects the rooms periodically,
3. since the room are open to the exteriors, many insects shared me the room, a butterfly, a fly, and a crawling insect.
4. The toilet paper and tissue paper are of very bad qualities. even the towels, although very clean, but they are of poor and very thin quality.
5. The TV has no remote control, and if you do not change the channel, it go back to the motel advertizing channel at a programmed time!!!!
6. The most negative part was that they have a decievning ad on the net. They say that the rooms were newly renovated, however, the odor; the carpet was very stained and the furniture is from the 1980s.
PS. I checked in after midnite, and I immediatley told the recpetionist on the phone that I did not like the room and I will check out in the morning, however, I had to stay 3 nites as I had a full three days of meetings at the university and used to come by the end of the day very exhausted.",2.0,1,1.0

"Nice if you like old hotels that need updating.
Thank goodness we booked a suite. If we had booked just a room with two beds for four adults we never would have fitted in the beds, they are only UK 3/4 beds, not even double. We were told all the beds were the same so no point in changing. As we had a suite we had two proper beds, one sofa bed and one fold up bed but would not have been any use for four adults. Contrary to what the booking said online. We had two adults and two daughters aged 17 and 15.
Room was very tatty and in need of renovation. Broken tiles in bathroom, clean but looked dirty if you know what I mean.
Location good as there is an underground walkway to Grand Central Terminal just outside the door.
Breakfast good but slow to clear plates and only one 4 slice toaster for the whole reastuarant, so a lot of waiting. Only had breakfast once after that. Expensive at $143 breakfast for four without tip.
We did not have dinner as there did not seem to be any food that was not fancy.

Not impressed at all and we will not be returning.",3.0,2,1.0
"A very nice stay overall
This hotel is located in downtown Memphis only a few blocks from Beale Street, Blue City Cafe, The Peabody Hotel(which has the marching ducks at 5pm in the lobby) and restaurant The Rendezvous. If you are willing to walk a bit further, it is close to Gus's Fried Chicken and The National Civil Rights Museum. I really liked the open, airy lobby with modern furniture. They have free PC computers for those who do not have internet access and lots of pens in case you need to write something down. There are many areas in the lobby where you can sit and wait. They have a little cooler in the lobby with ice cream and snacks as well. There is wireless internet access in the rooms as well. One thing I particularly was grateful for the iHome docking station for iPhones or iPods because I did not bring my iPod charger, so that was helpful in charging my iPod. The valet service was excellent and I wish I could remember who the valet guy we had was that we liked so much. The rooms were very nice, the only pet peeves I had were that if people were outside in the halls and you were sleeping, you could hear them talking. I did not like the layout of the room. Since there were five of us in one room, (a suite) it was extremely tight. You walk in and to your left there is a sink and refrigerator and microwave, then a small loveseat which pulls out to a small bed, but the mattress and mattress pad were extremely thin, so even though the springs were not exactly poking into me, it was still old and tired, so not comfortable to sleep on at all. I was afraid the mattress would not hold my small frame because the mattress was so thin and was afraid the pull out bed would collapse with me in it. There were also two chairs and two small tables and a desk when the bed was folded up, but it was still crowded. Then walk two feet and there was a TV crammed between the part of the room separating the sleeping area from the work area. The beds were comfortable, as I did lounge on one a bit and then near the beds are the bathroom with a shower and toilet. The sink is outside of the bathroom. The breakfast was excellent, because they have something for everyone-a waffle making station, yogurty, muffins, eggs, sausage, warm oatmeal, instant oatmeal, cereal, juices, hard boiled eggs, instant hot chocolate, tea, etc. They also have a work out room. Their pool is strictly outdoor. 
Overall a pleasant stay which I enjoyed except for the pull out bed and the cramped quarters.",5.0,4,1.0
"Worse than accomodations in many Third World Countries
The hotel facilities are old even though apparently recently renovated. I experienced a whole host of calamities. The bathroom - unglazed, cracked bathtub desparately needs repair and the towel rack hangs over the toilet so if don't close the lid your towels fall in the toilet bowl. Internet - spotty at best (yet you get charged for this poor service). HVAC - air conditioner does not work so you can't cool the room down. TV did not work and when I called to get it fixed they told me to plug it in (why didn't they do that when they serviced the room). Front desk staff service was a joke - upon check in the person raved about what a nice room I was getting (""one of the best""). If this tiny ill maintained room is ""one of your best"" then this hotel is even worse than I thought. Only saving grace is location.",2.0,1,1.0
"A really 'classy' spot
The Regency just feels right. From the friendly doormen, the welcome men at the desk, the hustle & bustle of savvy travellers and professional New Yorkers, it's New York elegant. Even the smaller rooms are lovely, though the bigger ones and the suites are even better. It's the epicenter of the Power Breakfast- (if you can afford it.) They close next January for a year of renovation, so it'll be missed, but even better -- maybe more expensive? - when it reopens. Watch the rates - sometimes the prices are 'over the top', other times, you can get a great 'deal'.

"Warning: Great location, no sleep
First, here is a warning to future guests we didn't realize: 
If you want/need sleep, request it at check-in! The top floor has POV (great) and a dance club on Friday and Saturday nights until 2am. We didn't realize this and got a 9th floor room just under the club. Since this was a one-night retreat to the city to rest and relax, staying awake until 2am listening to booming dance club music was not a special treat. We were later told that at check-in you should request a room away from the club if you would like sleep I think this is sound advice for anyone checking in.
In fairness, management was very apologetic and offered many concessions to make up for the miscommunication, but let this serve as warning to future guests. If you're here to party and plan on staying out until 4am this is your place. But if you're in town to rest and get sleep after a long day either find another hotel or request a low floor room on the opposite side of the night club. 
POV roof top bar was an amazing experience, but my advice would be to stay at another hotel and go here for POV.",3.0,1,2.0
"Pleasantly surprised
The Extended Stay America hotel is located at the end of a cul-de-sac within an industrial park and surrounded by other name brand hotels. As noted by other reviewers it is unusual looking, as if in a previous life the building was a garden apartment and it could probable be converted to that again.
I booked a stay through Priceline and got a tremendous deal. The hotel would probably not be happy with me if I mentioned my rate in this review, but I was very pleased with the price. My room, and all rooms, was recently renovated. I returned to the hotel after work one day and found a brand new mattress. Next day there was a brand new flat panel tv. Next day was a brand new leather chair. They are really putting a lot of work into this hotel. My room was a corner unit, with windows on two walls so during the day the room was bright with natural sunlight.
The hotel has a small pool, small fitness room with three machines, and a laundry room with three washers. Seemed more than adequate; I never waited for any machines in either the fitness nor the laundry.
What makes this hotel stand out for me was the staff. Without exception every staff member acknowledged me with a smile and a pleasant greeting. I encountered desk staff, maintenance men and housekeepers and there were no sour attitudes. I would especially like to thank Shamika for her excellent customer service. Several times I checked out and back into this hotel, and each time she had my check-in processed before I arrived as she'd seen my reservation come through from Priceline. Also I would like to acknowledge Anissia and Audrey for their unfailing helpful and pleasant service.
Within walking distance there is a McDonalds, Chilis, Sonny's Barbecue, Subway and a Japanese steak house. Also restaurants and bars in the nearby Hilton and Marriott. There is a Costco and a gentleman's club within an easy walk.
I was at the Extended Stay Tyvola for close to two months, off and on, and have no complaint. It is a bit of a walk to the public transportation choices (there is a bus and a light rail station). Also, this complex of hotels considers itself to be in the airport area. Given that, I would only suggest that the hotel offer a shuttle van as it seems every other hotel in that neighborhood has one. Also would suggest a loyalty program like most hotel chains offer.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Not For Everyone
I have long held a certain fondness for the Kings Inn. Having stayed there numerous times, there was a feeling of comfort in staying in familiar surroundings on each trip to beautiful San Diego. I have always considered myself to be somewhat of a hotel or motel snob if you will, and the Kings Inn was my first venture into less luxurious surroundings. I fell in love with the wonderful Waffle House located adjacent to the property and while not cheap, the Waffle House does not skip on portions or service. The Amigo Spot is absolutely fantastic. The food is excellent and the staff charming. Saturday night at the Amigo offers up a live Jazz band which was very impressive on my last visit. Sadly, there is a downside to the Kings Inn, that I had chosen to ignore during past visits. Captivated by its charm, I looked past the musty ever present smell that seems to linger and the terribly stained carpet that has been present in every room I have stayed in. I also chose to ignore the filthy laundry room where the washers and dryers are covered in layers of dirt not only on the outside of the machines but on the inside as well. I soon came to realize that the lack of attention to cleanliness was not merely an oversight but rather a total disregard for those who have been loyal patrons of this establishment. The Kings Inn is always booked solid due to it's cult -like following. It is not hurting financially as it's rooms typically run from about 84.00 to over 100.00 a night ,however they do occasionally run specials. The reality is that the owner has no reason to keep the place up or even keep the place clean. People just keep coming back and I was one of them. I have decided to bid a fond farewell to the Kings Inn for now and hope that the owner will someday wake up and smell the mildew.",3.0,2,1.0

Once in bed, my husband saw a bug the size of a ladybug on his pillow. He jumped right out of bed and turned on all the lights. We found 4 bedbugs on his pillow! We called the front desk right away. A staff member immediately came to our room and took the pillow with the bugs. He said he didn't think they were bedbugs, but wasn't sure what they could be. He also said that the hotel was completely booked so he couldn't give us another room. There was NO way we were going to stay in that room, so we decided to leave.

"Not the best place to stay.
I was really looking forward to staying at the Pearl. After reading most of the reviews on trip advisor being positive, I thought we were going to be staying at a really cool place. The restaurant food was ok. Movie night was cool. Our first night at the hotel was a Thursday night. After the movie we went back to our room. The room smelled good. But, there were many areas which could have used some attention. Dust along the edges of the walls, Nicks in the nice white furniture (would look better if touched up), Bathtub really gross and needing to be replaced (found out the next day that the drain could use attention too....standing water while showering), the caulking along the bathroom floor was so bad and the glaze on the tile was coming off. Under the sink the pipes are rusting out. Just needed much needed repair or replacement. There is a hairdryer, but it is very sticky with hairspray and tons of lint in the vent. 
The noise from the hotel is awful. The same retro music playing all night long. And a huge gap under the door to the room, which does not help at all! One last thing, the bedding is soiled. I woke up after the first night and was going to pull up the comforter, this is when I saw the stains! Gross!! So, I left a note asking to be replaced. The comforter must have been just turned around, as the stains were still there! I would not stay here again! Staff is super nice and cool, but attention to detail is lacking.",2.0,1,1.0

"A change in management?
We initially stayed at Sofitel Chicago last September and had a pleasant experience (although the rooms do veer toward the cozier side). Last weekend when we were in town for my husband's MBA graduation, we thought of Sofitel again. Unfortunately, our experience began its steady downhill descent when we settled into our room only to find that the AC was not working (normally in March this would not be a problem, but it just so happened that temps were pushing 80 that day). We would have to pack everything back up and move to another room. Even after politely asking the manager at the front desk whether they would offer us anything to compensate for the hassle, he insisted that they could do nothing more than the exact same room on another floor. Nothing. Tip to hotel management: if you don't maintain your temperature control units properly resulting in guests having to re-pack all of their belongings to move to another room, then you'd better be prepared to offer them something - an upgrade, and if not, at the very least breakfast on the house. 
If this had been the only issue during our stay, then we might possilby consider returning. Maybe the front desk manager was just having a bad day. But during our stay there were a host of other issues including the wireless internet not working (and even worse, the hotel not being able to offer a solution other than waiting until the next day when the whole system apparently reboots), returning to the room in the early afternoon after being out several hours during the morning to find the room still not made up, the safe in our room malfunctioning. The plumbing also leaves something to be desired - the water pressure in the shower was weak, and it felt like they were rationing hot water.

"Excellent stay until...... the fat lady sang......
Okay, first, it wasn't a fat lady, but after a wonderful time, the last few moments in the hotel left me shaking my head.
I was coming into NYC with a well known person for a party, and because of previous experiences while out with him, I have literally had his fans toss me to the side like a rag muffin so that they could get close to him and a photo, and my experience with another well known hotel the week before where I was actually panhandled by a driver and badgered unrelentlessly, I with purpose called the Le Parker and specifically requested that we be placed in an area of the hotel that might assure us some privacy and they handled our request beautifully. 
Our room was spacious and well appointed, we were never bothered by staff, and our request for an extra robe and towels was met quickly and with efficiency. Note to hotel- when 2 guest are checking into a room, it would be appropriate to have two robes available for each guest, especially with the fact that it was specifically requested that we truly wanted privacy. 
The staff upon check in were wonderful and allowed for a very quick check in with very little needed. The concierge was quick to provide an umbrella fir our use during the rain pour, and were kind enough to remember who I was when I returned the umbrella.
The bar area is beautiful, as is the pools view. The decor tasteful, sleek with a very Euopean flair. Our mini bar was well stocked and the shower in the room was a treat for a physically tired body..... I had just commuted well over 33 hours in just 4 days and was a little beaten up by it all, and the shower felt like a hundred magic fingers releasing the stresses of travel.
Everything was perfect for us, as we have both stayed at the hotel before, and my last experience had left me with a headache, this one while there did not, and for him, it brought back a rush of memories of many a night there while in tour or seeing old friends and this trip was also proving to be an experience of fondess until our check out time.
We had opted for the breakfast package where we could check out later, this giving us some time to relax before hurrying off to our next destination, which we luxuriated in. It was a wonderful treat to be able to do this..... but upon check out is when it became nasty and well turned a wonderful experience into one that fell short of what we would expect of a hotel of this level.
Instead if opting for the express check out we went to the front desk to do so. I had placed our incidental charges in cash and as we had not used anything, not even getting the breakfast that was part of the package, this should have been a very easy process. It was not. The woman checking me out was insolent, and quite frankly her behavior was unacceptable by all means.
I wasbnot rude, did not speak down to her, was not snippy, but walked away in complete frustion and with a foul taste in my mouth.
When I went to check out, I handed her my receipt for my deposit. She pulled up my info on her pc screen and asked me how I wished to pay for the reminder of my charges that I owed after she would be crediting my account with the 100 dollars for incidental charges. WHAT?????? What charges, we hadn't used anything, hadn't ordered room service, hadn't gotten the breakfast that was part of our package, had not used the minibar, had not purchased a robe, but yet she wanted me to pay an additional 299 dollars that she was stating I still owed. My mind was completely boggled now, I had pre-reserved the room, which also meant that I had put the room on my credit card and had already seen that the amount had been dedeucted from my account, how on earth could I owe another 300 dollars???? This went on and on and on... meanwhile my companion is beginning to get very restless and becoming very uncomfortable standing there as all of this is playing out.... and to top things off, we were checking out before the time we needed to as we needed to beat traffic out of the city so that he could make his next concert in an entirely different state within a few hours. 
Upon feeling his extreme discomfort and my total frustration at the situation that was unfolding I urged him to go get the car around so that we could still try to make it out of the city in time, and I pulled out my IPad so that I could pull up my account online and show this woman that the room was already paid for. At this point she disappeared for an ungodly amount of time, leaving me unattended and nervously looking at the time that was passing. 
When she finally returned she was still rude, which is when I explained that I had and have been a previous guest at this very hotel as well as the entire family if hotels that they have, which is when her tone dripped with sarcasm and actual disbelief tht I could have possibly stayed hee before. At that point I was fed up and told her that the way this was being handled was completely unacceptable on every level and if we had not been pressed for time I would have demanded to see a manager. 
I showed her on my IPad my online banking account that indeed showed the room had already been paid for, and at that point she sulkingly returned my deposit and I left the hotel completely exasperated, frustrated and no longer with the fond memories of a night spent blissfully but now only concerned about my companion making his previously booked engagement and apologetic that he had to stand there in the lobby while all of this transpired.
After my last two experiences with this hotel I am truly questioning if I would indeed be a guest at this hotel again, the only saving grace may be the location and the pool and the performance of the other staff during my stay.",2.0,5,-3.0

"Very Disappointing
The Seattle Pacific Hotel is definitely a dive. We reserved our room ahead of time, and had reserved a Queen bed. We guaranteed our room for late arrival with a credit card, as I believe is common with most room reservations. Nearby construction made the hotel nearly impossible to get to. When we arrived at 12:05 a.m. the clerk said we were lucky because he'd have given our room up at 1 a.m. He also informed us that we'd have forfeited our room fee as well and the person who got the room would also pay. Can they do that? When I questioned why, he had no answer, only that he had only been there a month. We were given a terribly stale room on the second floor overlooking the pool and hot tub which were both full of disgusting, green, stagnant water. The headboard attached to the wall was for a queen sized bed, however, the bed in front of it was a double with a twin sized sheet for a top sheet. Since the bedding was a bit scary, neither one of us wanted to give up the sheet next to our bodies.

"The ownership, management and staff have no conscience...
We spent a wonderful but quick weekend in Manhattan, primarily to see the Nutcracker at Lincoln Center (fabulous), Rockefeller Center at night (packed but beautiful) and eat our way through our favs (Carnegie Deli, Ray's Pizza, Brooklyn Diner). Our base of operations was Hotel Carter for one night. We had seen the reviews online and decided to roll the dice on this since it was a) one night, b) cheap, c) great location. Well we came up snake eyes. 
After asking for a ""renovated room"" we got a ""sure, no problem"" from the clerk. After taking our money we got our keys and headed up to Room 1024. Yikes! Mildew on the ceiling in the bathroom, a really crappy paint job, dingy carpets, no extra plugs, hastily stuffed in AC unit in the window, mostly dusty and dingy room. So much for the upgrade...
Having come off of a red eye into JFK on that morning and spent all day in town and the Nutcracker, we were so tired we didn't shower, just headed to bed. Big mistake... The next morning, no hot water... Went down to the front desk, lobby packed with people all asking the same question: when's the hot water coming back. Answer? 1 hour. That was the standard answer the staff gave anyone at 6, 7, 10, 11 am. The hot water never came back, in fact by 10 am there was no water period. We asked for a credit or refund. Need to talk to the manager, we were told. Where is he? It's his day off, we were told. REALLY? No water and the manager is out for the day? The lies continued... The front desk staff had the gall to keep checking people in. As we were checking out, I kept telling people walking up to check in that there was no water. Otherwise they never would have been told by the staff. 
This place is run by a slumlord, who milks money out of customers and delivers crap for value.
DON'T STAY HERE!!!",1.0,2,-1.0
"Ok, but I expect more from Sheraton and SPG hotels.
I recently stayed at the Sheraton Downtown Hotel in Denver, Colorado, as I was attending a conference at the hotel.
I stayed in a room on the 18th floor of the 'tower' building. There are 2 main buildings in the hotel, the plaza building and the tower building. They are connected either via the walkway on level 2 or via the concourse level (below ground).
I had read other reviews of the hotel and most people make some complaints about the tower building suggesting it is better to be in the plaza building. With that in mind I had asked the hotel to locate me in the plaza building, however that did not occur. There was no explanation upon my check-in as to why they were unable to meet this request. In deed at the time I checked in, there was no acknowledgement that I was an SPG member and I often stay at SPG hotels. I assume the whole concepts of SPG membership is to seek loyalty, however with no acknowledgement etc., they certainly donât make you feel valued in any way.
In any event, my stay was in the tower building. The rooms in the tower building and the plaza building were apparently renovated at the same time. The tower building is a fair distance from the hotel lobby and it is often much quicker to go to the street level and walk across the road, rather than go to level 2 and walk across the connecting walkway. The benefit of the tower building is that the gym is on the ground level of that building. The gym is well equipped and quite good.
The room at the hotel was ok. I had a king size bed that was comfortable. There is no refrigerator provided in the room (which I find really odd) and similarly there was no mini-bar or snacks provided to purchase. I wanted a small refrigerator and one was delivered to my room. The desk set-up in the room is a little odd. There is a main desk and then an oval shaped desk which slides under the main desk. All seemed a little odd.
The air-conditioner system in the room was very noisy and I had significant difficulty in working out how to turn it off and night so I could sleep. Still donât know how I managed to turn it off, but once I did, I just left it off for my whole stay of 6 nights. I am quite technically minded, however there was no on/off switch or anything similar.
The bathroom was extremely small. There is a shower over bath and barely enough room to stand on the floor outside the bath and in front of the vanity unit. With the bathroom door shut when you shower, the whole mirror fogs up as there is a lack of sufficient ventilation. Hotels these days make little investment in quality toiletry products and the Sheraton is no exception. If you like good products (shower gel and shampoo etc), then bring your own.
The rooms, whilst comfortable, need updating and are a little âtiredâ.
You have to pay for internet connection in your room, which in this day and age, seems a little odd. I paid for the highest speed wireless connection at $14.95 a day. There is free internet in the Lobby area of the hotel, however I needed access from my room so I could work.
A number of people have commented on how quick the lifts are. Wellâ¦..yes, they move quickly between the ground floor and the 18th floor, however my experience was that you always had to wait many minutes for a lift to arrive. Because of this, the lifts were always full and it felt like we stopped at every floor. There are 6 lifts in the tower building which sounds sufficient, however there was always a long wait.
When I checked out, the lady at reception simply said that there was a zero balance (I had already provided my credit card) and that they would email me a copy of the invoice. Whilst still at the hotel I checked my email and a copy of the invoice and noticed that they had charged me twice for the internet usage. I then went back to reception where they rectified this. In hindsight, I am surprised that they did not show me a copy of the invoice and ask for confirmation of the expenses before they charged my credit card.

The hotel staff is friendly and always greet you when you come in.

Since this was my first trip to NYC I read a lot of reviews for all the hotels before making a selection. I believe I made a very good choice.

The bathroom was very clean and bright. Bed was comfortable and there was free wi-fi, complimentary water and breakfast coupons for the cafe next door which serves great bagels with cream cheese. 
I'll be sure to stay here on my next trip to NYC, of course I'd read the reviews again before making a choice.

"Disgusting Stained Sheets, Broken Doors, Untrained Staff
This is the worst hotel I've stayed in in Boston. I got stuck in 2760 (supposed to be one of their Starwood Preferred Rooms - Yikes!) and I nearly vomited in my mouth by noticing stained sheets just before going to bed (be sure to check your sheets before you go to bed!) - it was so disgusting - i can't believe housekeeping didn't notice this. I've never experienced this in a hotel ever. **Do yourself a favor - stay right across the street at the Hilton**
Then the front door to the room is broken - the deadbolt doesn't retract when you try and close the door. 
Finally, this hotel has the smallest room bathrooms in America - i feel like the bathroom is the size of the hotel room bathrooms in Tokyo - tiny tiny tiny. If you like feeling like you're in a straight jacket when you're in your bathroom - you'll feel right at home. 
The entire front staff during check in were all marked with Trainee tags with no actual real employees around who seemed to know what they were doing. 
Lastly, the Sheraton reservation system is AWFUL. It constantly crashes and kept either erasing our reservations or could not get our check in / check out or room holder name right. I couldn't believe it. I spent nearly 4 days on the phone with their offsite reservations, hotel reservations, hotel manager, front desk and when I checked in - it STILL wasn't right. UN-FREAKING Believable?!
Save your money - don't stay at the dumpiest hotel in Boston - pick a better chain like the Hilton across the street (same price) or a Marriott or really ANY other hotel should be better than this one to ensure you have a great stay in Boston.",2.0,1,1.0

Well, I had to keep calling and if they got the towels delivered, they did not replace the shampoo and soap. The maids barge in quickly and barely give you time to get to the door.

"You get what you pay for
My wife and I went on a weekend getaway in January in lieu of Christmas presents. We picked the Hotel Belleclaire because it was a really great rate for a room in its location. I found the service to be good quality, and we really liked the breakfast and comedy show package we booked. The problem we had with the Hotel is that we froze both nights. I assumed that I needed to turn the heat up but it didn't make a difference. The window was a little drafty which is probably expected but the real problem was that we didn't have any heat. The morning we checked out I told the front desk clerk that they had better have somebody check it out, and later I overheard one of the maintenance people so that it wasn't working properly. 
So there you have it. My parents stayed there before and really enjoyed it. The price was nice, we liked the comedy show, the breakfasts, and the parking--but I froze when I got out of the shower. I walked by a few weeks ago and noticed they were undergoing major renovations so hopefully that is something they'll address.",1.0,3,-2.0

OK, se early check in is out of the question, if you ask for it, they will tell you they will see when you arrive and then of course they can't accomodate. The room itself had the worse beds ever! one was hard as anything, the other we could feel all the srpings and the fold out sofa bed is just horrible. When we finally did get the room, it smelled bad and was dirty throughout. The front door had a gap at the bottom that a little person could possibly fit through, so every noise in the hallway was heard. At about 8:00 p.m. a maintenance person sowed up to repair a broken handle on the dresser, yet we didn't request this, they apparently could not fix that when the room was vacant. The Breakfast and evening food buffets were horrible! The fruit was either not ripe or over ripe, the waffle makers both took ages for the waffles to cook and then every waffle would stick to the maker.

"Nothing Special
After a friend recommended this place to us for the best view in Seattle we went ahead and booked the room. 
The location is conveniently located near downtown and areas of interest. Of course this also includes being next to train tracks. That if your room is not facing the water will most likely hear the noise. 
Upon first arrival please first know that it is a valet only parking, and do not have public parking. For valet parking it is $36/day which will be added to your bill later. 
The lobby, staff, and lounge are all nice and noteworthy. They placed used in on the 4th floor facing the street. Hmmmm...was hoping for water front but OK. The room was extremely small, so small that we could barely fit our luggage in the room and get it past the bed. I seen bigger rooms in Manhattan. We did hear what ever noise machinery was on the room and train throughout the night. The flatscreen TV in the room was old and had bad static. The phone seemed like it had not been clean for a few years. As well as the clock in the room was off by about 5 hours. 
The bathroom was the nicest part of the room with a upscale contemporary look and rock shower. 
After 2 days we decided to ask for a room facing the water and a bigger room. They were about to say no, but luckily they found a room on the first floor. Upon entry into the room it was definitely bigger. The funny thing is the lady said ""oooooh yeah you are in our smallest room available"". The room did face the water, but faced the pier side with a giant crane in front of the room. Not exactly what I was looking for but atleast its bigger, and our last 2 nights went smoothly.

There are a number of cafes and restaurants in the immediate area to get food. There is a bit of noise in the rooms at the front as it is close to the L. The room overlooked a large car park, so don't expect a view. The room has a small ensuite bathroom with bath and shower, but no hairdryer. Limited toiletries are supplied. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There are lifts to all floors. My only criticism is that our room was not cleaned until late afternoon approx 17-00 hours which coincided with our wanting to have a rest prior to going out in the evening.

I've stayed at this property 4 times in the last 2 months and was not overly impressed.

Even after getting them to correct this upon checkin I was still denied breakfast on one occassion even after the restaurant inquired with the front desk, so beware that you get everything included in your rate.
Other than my issues with the breakfast, the hotel is acceptable, but not exceptional.
The Good: Nice lobby area; staff was friendly; comfortable and nicely appointed rooms; great internet speeds
The Bad: HVAC is loud; try to get a room away from the main road (Tower Rd.) because road noise can be heard in the room; small fitness center; bathroom counter is small

"The Perfect Stay For Elvis Fans
My second stay here and the hotel is starting to look a little tired but, as theyâre planning a rebuild on the other side of the Boulevard, I guess itâs understandable that they donât want to spend too much on refurbishing. Also, with the surrounding area becoming a little dodgy and being situated so far from Downtown (or anything else really!) this probably isnât the kind of hotel for the generic traveller.
If, however, youâre an Elvis fan or just want to submerge yourself in the Elvis experience this is the ideal hotel for a few nights as youâll be staying literally a couple of minutes walk away from Graceland. Why not take the opportunity to visit the Meditation Garden at 7:30am (for free) and pay your respects as itâs so convenient? The in room TVs have an additional three Elvis channels with one for movies, one for music videos (clips from films, etc) and a third piping the Sirius Elvis Radio station. Still not enough Elvis for you? Why not relax during the evening in the Jungle Lounge and watch the large screen projection as they play various DVDs (also on sale in the gift shop)?
The included breakfast bar has a nice selection and tea/coffee remains available throughout the day. Food in the Jungle Lounge, while being a little basic, is tasty and decent value. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful â a real case of that good olâ Southern Hospitality!

I first saw this hotel driving down PCH and always wanted to try them out. It seemed like a decent place to stay and after reading the reviews on Yelp and Tripadvisor I decided to try them out. 
When I arrived, there were only a few cars in the parking lot. One thing I noticed is that if the parking lot was nearly full it would be hard to either get in or get out and my first night staying there I encountered this problem
Checking into the room was fast and easy and the person at the front desk was very helpful. I was able to get a room with 2 full size beds(which is what I wanted but at the time of booking there were non-available). I had just gotten off work and wanted to at least take a nap before I went out that same night but was not able to do so for the fact that the cable guy was I guess fixing the cable in my room.
Once I was able to actually go inside my room I was very surprised to see that it was extremely clean. I inspected the entire room and saw no signs of any dirt which was a plus in my book. The room was very nice though the beds were a bit small(full size instead of queen). It had a table and 2 chairs, Microwave, Mini refrigerator and a 32 inch plasma TV. The bathroom was nicely remodeled as well. The only thing I would suggest is to ditch the comforter on the bed. That thing was extremely itchy. I didn't even use it because of this problem. To be very honest I would get rid of the linen as well because that too was also irritating my skin.
The location of the motel is perfect because it is surrounded by a lot of food places such as McDonalds, Jack in the Box, Carls Jr,etc and if you want to have a sit down dinner there are restaurants maybe 10 minutes down PCH.
Overall this is not a bad place to stay if you don't plan on being in the hotel all day(only to sleep). Its located in a great area. It was good for the price, clean, and nice",4.0,3,1.0

The hotel was close to grant park, so we could just walk to the festival. There are also plenty of subway lines close to it.
The hotel was clean, Great service from the staff.",4.0,5,-1.0
"If you have taste, and you MUST be near UW, this is the place.
My husband and I are world travelers, and are lucky enough to be highly selective when choosing hotels. That said, our daughter was graduating from UW, which was the only reason we needed to stay in Seattle this particularly jammed summer weekend, so we wanted to be as close to her and the campus as we could get. This hotel was our top choice out of the very few choices that were CLOSE TO CAMPUS.
The positives:
Clean rooms and lobby.
""Up to date"", design wise, if a bit over used.
Large windows in rooms, some views of the water, which were surprisingly nice.
Decently large, comfortable rooms, with wifi, desk, chairs, clean roomy closet.
Modern bathrooms, equipt with the usual soap/shampoo/etc items. 
Cozy but ""slightly worn down,"" lobby--we liked sitting by the fireplaces on those ridiculously frigid Seattle summer nights. Also nice is the live jazz from the celler club that you can sit and listen to while by the fire in the lobby.
The negatives:
No robes in rooms.
Very expensive parking, but one should expect that in any city.
The desk staff is polite, but very young, i.e., inexperienced.
The price of the rooms we'd reserved went down between the time we reserved and the time we actually used the rooms, and the staff had to be persuaded to give us the better price. Slightly unprofessional, especially since we'd reserved the most expensive rooms for the full weekend. They were not what we'd call, ""guest orientated"".",4.0,3,1.0
"EXCELLENT BASE IN NYC.
The hotel is basic and standard. At check in, little stress because the rooms were not ready. It were ready after 4PM, after much insistence with the receptionist, who showed irritation and impatience. Rooms cleaned daily and beds very soft and first class sheets.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Terrible treatment for Gold member
I recently booked a stay here using points, as I am a nearly 30-year Marriott customer. I intended to stay with my family over Thanksgiving, while visiting relatives. I called in advance to check on availability of rooms, and was assured there were plenty unbooked. When my family and I arrived, we were told that we would not be upgraded, but that we could purchase the upgrade with cash. It wasn't an issue of the room type we desired being unavailable, but simply management's discretion. After much conversation with the Assistant Manager, we requested that they call the Tempe location and check availability there. Instead, we were given the number and called ourselves. Tempe location was more that happy to accommodate, so we packed our bags back into the car and drove to the Tempe location. Our stay there was perfect, they could not have been more welcoming. Tempe will be our destination of choice from here on out. Special thanks to their Front Desk Supervisor, Christine H. for making our Thanksgiving a wonderful experience. Marriott has a gem in this employee.",1.0,5,-4.0
"Totally overpriced motel revamp
A well decorated motel -cute, but with still the same structure and paper thin walls. Very pricey for what it is.
No welcome greeting by the guy checking us in, his colleague eventually offered us the cookies that we're out for guests.
 We booked 2 rooms paying on the same credit card but had to go through the check in process twice despite providing all the details when checking in online.
Had room on 3rd floor -loud traffic noise, a lot less on the ground floor.",1.0,3,-2.0
"Disappointed
This Hotel was pretty downstairs but for $191.00 I got a room that was very tiny, the bathroom was so small they had to put the toilet in at an angle, The hot water was luke warm and turned to cold within running 2"" of water. $18 for parking was rediculous for someone spending so much money on a room. My room was located on the club side of the hotel and could hear the thumping of the music all hours of the night. Thier add states that they have a heated pool and the pool water was as cold as ice. The internet showed it to be a Holiday Inn and it was not. I was told over the phone that it had an indoor heated pool and jaccuzzi and it did not. They do not furnish refridgerators or microwaves so you forced to throw out leftovers and cant even keep cold drinks...glad Im not on insilin! It is my opinion that the price for this hotel is way over priced for what you get in return. I will not stay at this hotel again for the same money I could have stayed closer to the riverwalk ammenities and had a hot bath when I returned to my room. Very dissatisfied.",1.0,2,-1.0
"A clean hotel
This Radisson is located right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. The room was clean and the bed was one of the remote controlled, adjustable beds that you can alter the firmness or softness on each side of the bed. Great for getting into a comfortable sleeping position. The room itself is a bit on the small side with not much room around the bed. You get a definite cramped feel in the standard room. This hotel is currently under construction (something I didn't know and wasn't made aware of when I booked my reservation.) It's not noisy when you're trying to sleep at night. The noise from passing trolleys on the street in front of the hotel can be loud at times. You get a little used to it after a day or two. During the day there's a bit of noise and a number of workers throughout the building. It looks almost like two hotels were combined here. There are multiple elevators and some wings of the hotel seem far newer than others. The staff is friendly and courteous. Parking here is ridiculously high. I paid just under $40 a day to SELF park in the attached garage. I thought about moving to one of the nearby independent parking garages, but after doing a bit of research and reading online reviews of them I decided not to. Do NOT park at the nearby parking ramps unless you absolutely have to and your car poses no temptation at all to thieves. My car was safe at the Radisson, but nearby garages have a high incidence of break-ins. The area the hotel is in is relatively safe and well lit. I wouldn't recommend that a woman venture out alone at night. It's safe-ish, and there are lots of joggers during the day, but at night I would recommend that women venture out with a group or take a cab since this is a major city. You're in a heavily tourist area here.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Terrific, if you can get a good upgrade
The W Lakeshore is an interesting property. I'm rating this based on my experience, and not what I think the standard experience is. When checking in, due to our platinum status, and the fact that my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary, we were upgraded to a marvelous suite facing the lake. The view was terrific, and the suite was beautiful and spacious. It did look a little loved and worn in places We had a powder room off the main entrance, a spacious living room with wetbar, and big windows looking over the lake. The location is terrific, across from Navy Pier. And 5 miuntes to Michigan Avenue. 
When I was looking at the floorplans, the standard rooms looked fairly small -- and the bathrooms very small. But our suite had quite a large bathroom with separate shower, which was quite nice and spacious. With a view all the way out the window to the lake, no less!
It's clear that this hotel was something much more standard, that the W shined up. The lobby is a neat place. A standard hotel lobby during the day, turned bar and meeting space in teh evening. We also had drinks on the rooftop bar, which was sleepy (mid week), but a good view and comfortable atmosphere. 
The complimentary Acura Car Service was terrific -- we took it out to Wrigley Field for the Cubs Game. I just wish they came to get you, but, alas, it's only one-way service. 
We had a nice breakfast in the lobby the next morning, and it was mostly filled with young businessmen. I think the hotel loosens up on the weekends, and I'd like to see that sometime.
The only hiccough for us on this trip was when we called the bellman they never showed up. Oh well, we can grab our own bags. 
Overall, I enjoyed this hotel very much and I am rating it on the experience that we had (upgrade to a great suite, late check-out, comped breakfast, and a terrific low corporate rate). Had I paid the $400+ they were asking and didn't receive any upgrades, I would think that this place is terrible value. That said, I really like W Hotels, and this one -- while certainly no Montreal -- is a nice place. I'll come back on a Summer Weekend next time.",5.0,4,1.0
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER
We had booked a suite several weeks in advance for my sisters bachelorette party, basically for all girls to have a meeting place, time to get ready, area to have gift exchange and appetizers before we all headed out on the town for fun festivities and of course a place the a few us to stay after. 
Check in was great and without a problem, room space was pleasant and everything appeared to be perfect. Then the ladies started to arrive for our gift exchange, we had about 10 ladies in a suite which had adequate space but we soon realized it was getting extremely hot in the room. Also as guests arrived we noticed water leaking from the ceiling directly above the front door. We decided to call the front desk for maintenance. Maintenance personnel responded promptly, he stated the AC unit had frozen over, which is why the room was so hot and stuffy. The water leak was coming from the condensation. Maintenance explained this was a HVAC room that has been having AC issues and they were all well aware of. The maintenance tech was shocked it was not expressed to us at check in or that the room wasn't offered at the discounted rate. Per the tech only way to solve issue was to crack the heater on high to defrost the AC, as the room was already hot, plus it was 95 degrees outside we did not want the heater on. We were also were in the middle of gift exchange (which involved lots of lingerie) so it was a little uncomfortable to have a male present. We were offered a bottle of champagne but was NEVER delivered! 
When we went to the front desk to resolve our issues we were less the satisfied with both the level of service of ""MOD"" and the lack of accommodations that were offered, actually we were threaten instead by Alexandra* (not sure if the name was correct but she introduced herself as the manager on duty but then later retracted that statement as she was only training.) We were told that the hotel was full house and the only room they move us too would be a regular room nothing else? We paid for a suite so a smaller at the same rack rate wouldn't really be ideal, but manager on duty or should I say employee in training since she is in training she does not know how to change room rate? (Which we found odd as the hotel was completely full on a Saturday night and they only had a person in training?) Nothing else was done or offered made us feel like we were more of a hassle then paying customers. We had planned on dealing with an actual manager the next upon check out but surprise surprise it was the same women as the night before, she didnât ask how our night turned out after our whole experience. 
Since our experience I have called numerous times with NO call back or follow up, I have sent emails with NO response. I have even placed a complaint with the local BBB and they did not even get a response. It is obvious this company does not care about the integrity, patrons or reputation and all I can say is I will never stay at another Marriott own facility and I highly recommend staying elsewhere especially if you are looking for a hassle free stay.
* When I mentioned were threaten was because we had decline the smaller room and told the training ""MOD"" we needed better accommodation she said she would call the fire marshal because we had 10 girls in a room that is meant for 6, mind you we were not all staying just doing gift exchange and eating, but insisted she could have us all escorted out! Excuse me???? I asked for supporting documentation which was not provided, trying to not get outrageously angry I advised her to go ahead and call the fire marshal if thatâs what needed to be done. How is the world does someone threaten a patron when they are a paying customers not getting what they paid for??????? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT EVER, comical she is a manager in training.",1.0,2,-1.0

"Old San Francisco building on edge of a lousy neighborhood.
I was restricted on where I could stay based on a GSA Per Diem allowance for reimbursement. In San Francisco, everything is stupidly expensive and the hotels are no exception. None of the hotels I looked at (20+) offered a government rate during the time that I had to travel to San Fran. The only one I could find within a 45-60 min travel time from the office, and within budget, was this one.
The staff was friendly and helpful. I arrived early in the day, and was allowed to check in early without any extra fees. That was great! The hotel its self is fairly clean, but you can only do so much with an old building. There was no provision for A/C in my room, and heat was in the form of an old steam radiator. Being San Francisco, the heat was actually still on in June and the windows open in the afternoon with a ceiling fan was sufficient. The bathroom, perfectly functional, was small and a little antiquated. One could easily tell that layer upon layer of paint had been applied to the building over the years.
The hotel its self is perfectly safe and in an ok location. If you go one block downhill, you've gone the wrong direction, right into what the locals call ""Skid Row"" that has more homeless people than you could shake a stick at. For several city blocks, the smell of urine was overwhelmingly disgusting. If you go up hill, you're in a perfectly decent part of San Fran with busses that are on schedule and take you wherever you need to go.",2.0,3,-1.0

"Very ... W
So, I booked a long week end at this hotel, being my first time in La I had no idea what to expect about the location and the hotel itself, I had read many negative reviews about it and was a little worried.
We arrived at the hotel at around 1.30 AM and we got upgraded to a Corner King Suit (apparently in this hotel all - or most - of the rooms are suites but there are few corner king suites).
The room was great, modern, clean, almost bigger than my apartment in Manhattan - I have no real complains about the rooms - we were very satisfied with the upgrade.
In the morning the W offers free coffee/tea to hotel guests, we never ate at the restaurant for breakfast but it looked pretty good, plus it has a small outdoors place you can sit and have your breakfast, which I thought was very relaxing.
If I had to describe the hotel in one word I would say modern and very ... W.
The pool is really small, more like a pond. I really loved the flavored water they offered for free throughout the day at both the front desk and the pool, I think it add a lot to a service and shows class, the same thing is offered at the Ritz, it doesn't cost them much but having a cup of water ready for guests is always appreciated.
On Sundays apparently the W has pool parties and the pool gets crazy crowded, I think they let just about everybody who asks to get in, in - 
About parking - well, in theory the who street where the W is at has a 2 hour limit parking but I still have to understand how they can figure out how long you have been there for - we were lucky and we parked on the street for more than 2 hours and didn't get a ticket.
The side streets some have 1 hour limit.
Only complain I have is that we had been charged or parking and food we didn't use/buy - but we got that straightened out no problem - I am pretty sure that happened on a Sunday when random people showed up to the pool party and charged a room - I wish the W had better ""security"" regarding charging things on a room's bill, they should ask for a last name and double check that is correct, maybe not only the room number, anybody would just say any room number and sign it. Good thing is everything got straightened out though and we weren't charged for food we didn't consume and parking we didn't use.
The location was also great, pretty central (well, almost everything in LA, apparently, is at least 45 mins drive away. 
I recommend the W of Westwood.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Roaches and Crickets is ur best friend
Let's see......Came in to visit for the 35th annual National Bikers Roundup! We pull up in the front of the hotel. The outside looks ok (don't be fooled). But we asked to see the rooms just to make sure we would be comfortable. For some reason I had a gut instinct that this would not be the place for me. The Manager took us to a room on the bottom floor. We saw Crickets (which I thought were Roaches) all over the property. So we asked him to show us upstairs thinking we could get away from them...Hmmm NOT.....when u walk in the room it is super small....Turned around to leave only to see a (Roach/Cricket) on the floor in the room. The Manager words were ""we can't help the crickets becuase they are an outside spieces and there is no way to spray for them"" So we told them to keep their room and left.

"Nice place, but you need work-arounds
I stay here every year for a conference, and I look forward to it. However, you need to know how to work-around some serious issues. For example, the first night I was awakened by loud & sharp street noises that penetrated the 20th floor. Things like truck horn blasts at 4 AM, sirens, etc. The walls are paper-thin, so normal noises from surrounding rooms get through and so do the slamming of each nearby room doors. But, putting the fan for the heater on high drowns that out (messes with the room temp).
First morning my shower drain was slow and the shower was cold. In the afternoon the maint. engineer arrived, apparently summoned by housekeeping (this is a sign of a great hotel). I asked him to address the cold water, and he did. Nice.

When I checked in I told the lady I had requested a feather free room, she proceeded to argue with me that I did not.

She sent someone up with pillows later and I tried to explain that the sheets needed to be changed and the housekeeper did not speak a word of English. I called back down and the clerk (who I believe was the GM) was very nasty. It took about an hour to get the sheets changed. They also tried to charge me for parking eventhough, I did not have a car at the hotel. I did encounter one male employee that was very helpful when I needed some tape. There were also toiletries in the restrooms downstairs which I thought was very nice and the pool looked very inviting.

"Consistent
I stayed at the Warwick over the weekend. I booked through Priceline & got another great deal. DH & I previously stayed at this property in the summer of 2009. Not much has changed. 
The lobby is still the hotelâs best feature. The staff wants to serve. Even though I arrived at 11 am, I was given a room right away which was a very pleasant surprise. Ed, the bellman, was a doll. He was able to give me directions to the restaurant where I was meeting friends & to the local Catholic Church. He was thoughtful in his answer about whether I could walk somewhere safely alone as a woman. He said yes & it was fine. He even remembered me the next day which was sweet of him. 
I HATE the Sleep NumberÂ® beds & as a result got very little sleep because I find them so uncomfortable. I wake up when I encounter a different surface â the air chambers vs. the padded frames around them. I did learn the next morning that I could have asked for a room with a conventional bed. I will definitely do that if I ever come back. 
I heard a lot of the street noise again. Patrons of Tavern 17 were having loud, drunken conversations right outside at all hours. Plus I heard all the street noise. The hotel is on a corner; you get it from all angles, even five stories up. 
The three worst features were in the bathroom. One the toilet paper roll is on the wall behind your left shoulder as you sit down. They need to move it to the back of the door in front of you. Very annoying. Two, the tub floor is incredibly & dangerously slippery. I thought I was going to kill myself. I couldnât stand still; my feet literally slid apart. I felt like my poor dog when he tries to sit on the hardwood floor & slides. The Warwick needs to invest in some RubbermaidÂ® bathmats before they get sued after somebody gets seriously injured. Third, the seal on the bathroom window wasnât great. You could feel the cold air seeping through. Not good on a January night.

"Something's crook in Tallarook.
Look, sometimes it is not just possible to pin point the exact problem with accommodation. The entrance, the room and the general environment at first glance seems to be in keeping with the 'Wellness' brochures and hotel paraphernalia.
Trouble is, in the end the feelings win out. Much was promised but little delivered. Even with the discounted room rates due to attending a 'Supernatural' weekend, the place seemed to exude an unhealthy atmosphere and left us feeling psychically ill at best.
Pity. The conference was great in spite of this. The fans made the most of what seemed like a hotel and staff who didn't really want us 'low life' there. We couldn't interest the staff in making us a hot chocolate at 10:45 on a Saturday in spite of them being happy to serve drunken hunks who had nothing to do with the 'weirdos' attending the conference.
In the Australian parlance we would term such people 'wankers'. Perhaps pretentious is a better use of the English language. Trying to charge us $US10 a minute for a call to family in Australia was ridiculously exorbitant.
When I pointed this out and that I intended to can the place in an internet review if they didn't life their game, the manager on duty agreed to drop the rate from $100 to $50 for my partners calls back to her mother and sister.
Beware. The room rate appears cheap, but it is easy to ramp up your costs by 100% if attention is not paid to the details of the small print. You get the room only for the rate quoted. The $5 discount for foregoing towel changing is only if you would be stupid enough to rent a room from them again, or the same chain. Another terminological inexactitude.

Don't take a chance. Very disappointing. The hotel is next to a loud multi-lane freeway. On the first night (it's too dark right outside the entrance) walking back from dinner, we saw a homeless person sleeping on the ground right before you get into the hotel. We saw several homeless roaming around within a block of the hotel at night. It was a bit concerning. Keep in mind this hotel is right next to the freeway 5. After paying for the hotel on HOTELS.COM, La Quinta charged us again for the stay on our credit card - double hit. It was an absolute mess trying to reverse the charge and getting it off our card. Even through that credit card mess, which the front desk person created, he was rude, condescending, unprofessional, and didn't really apologized for his mistake. The hotel also failed to disclose that they charge for parking. It's not about the money, it's about their unprofessional and dishonest attitude. When we asked about the additional charge on the card, more than one person said that it would be reversed once we check out. That wasn't the truth. The hotel is very dated and beat up. The air conditioner went on and off all night and it sounded like a very loud motor - no restful sleep for us. The room was somewhat clean and you can walk to the restaurants in Old Town San Diego - these were the only positives. But, be careful walking to and from the hotel.

Apart from the fact that the hotel is close to Time Square, all the rest is very disappointing.

The air conditioning system is independent in each room and is super noisy. So the choice you have at night is: don't sleep because of the heat or don't sleep because of the AC noise...
The housekeeping staff is very slow. They usually cleaned my room around 4 or 5pm! So if you want to come back to your room after a long day in the city and before going out for dinner, forget it, your room will still not be cleaned!

Especially if there are two sharing a bed. As a priority club Platinum member, I had booked a king bed with a sofa bed pull out for the three of us. That was all that available at booking. I was given an 'upgrade' upon arrival to two queen beds. That was fine but the beds were not queen sized and any photos in the advertisement is HIGHLY misleading. These beds are small!! They then describe them as FULL sized beds. We were given rooms on the top floor and told these were the best and renovated. My husband and I had to sleep on our sides back to back basically equal to sightly larger than a twin.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Nice hotel in good location
This was our first time to stay at the Magnolia. Great location for downtown area. All the staff were very nice and accommodating to every request. The valet parking may seem a little pricey, but worth it. The room was very large with great water pressure in shower. We stayed on the 21st floor and it was very quiet. An older building with character and chic relaxing decor inside. Good rates for such a classy hotel! Would stay here again. Cookies and milk are nice touch for bedtime.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Average accommodations
These are basic accommodations. We booked 2 rooms, one with two queens and one with a king. Both had an unpleasant odor, kind of musty, sickly sweet. I told the person at the desk when we left. And, both had ac units with very loud buzzing and rattling sounds. The noise of the ac units did drown out any other noises, so that was good. Carpet was kind of nasty looking. The bathrooms were nice and clean. There is a convenience store across the street, which is.....convenient. And, it is just two minutes from downtown. That was handy, as we were there to attend a downtown event. Otherwise, pretty basic for the price. But, I guess Phoenix is expensive.",2.0,3,-1.0

"best Super 8 in LA
We didn't know what to expect when we booked at this location. It is a diamond in the rough. It's nicely located and has ample parking. The lobby and reception is roomy and clean. Our room was clean, spacious and quiet. The breakfast was simple but generous with Costco bought bagels (cheese, poppy seeds, raisin, etc.), fruits, juices and coffee. A staff was always there to replenish or make more coffee and you were never left waiting for breakfast items. I think they had covers for coffee in case you wanted to grab and go. The desk staff (2 guys) were super helpful in answering our questions on how to get to different sightseeing attractions. This location is clean and very well-maintained unlike other Super 8 motels that we have stayed at during the rest of our California trip.",4.0,5,-1.0
"A Penthouse view is all you'll get.
On a recent visit to Los Angeles for several Stanley Cup Final Games, my Husband and I booked an executive suite at the Century City Regency Plaza Hyatt. We had booked the same type of room from a previous visit, which worked out well.
This time though, upon arrival, I was informed that, as a platinum member of Hyatts Passport club, I was upgraded to their Penthouse. Wow. Impressive, right?
Wrong. Dead wrong. The penthouse was a dilapitated two room affair with the following:
A black corner couch.
A Dresser with a T.V.
A desk.
A Bed.
A bar/safe bureau.
A chair.
Closet doors were misfit and creaky. The door knob-to-wood circular protectors were embarrasingly loose on the doors and the carpet and walls were stained.
This room was so depressing and vacant of all charm that I couldn't help but remark to hubby that there are third-world Gulags prisons furnished better than this 'Penthouse'. I do not understand how the Hyatt could charge more than 700.00 a night for a room no better than a Hollywood blvd. vagabond hotel.
Upon check-in, the Desk Clerk asked if I wanted a newspaper delivered each morning to the room and I asked; ""which paper?"". The answer? The Wall Street Journal...a paper I find as offensive as the rest of the Murdoch empire - but that's just my cranky preference. So. I asked for the LA TIMES and the clerk said in typical mod-speak: No problem.
Of course every morning, for three mornings, I received the Wall Street Journal. Every morning I returned the paper to the front desk and asked for the LA TIMES to be delivered for the next day. It was a problem. I gave up on it the last morning.
I returned to LA a week later, to watch the final hockey game of the season at Staples Center and I booked us at The Ritz-Carlton across the street. I was upgraded to A penthouse (naturally...) And guess what? The Ritz-Carlton UNDERSTANDS what the word 'Penthouse' means. I have never been treated better at a hotel. I am in the process of writing up that review.
Now I have had excellent rooms at other Hyatts (The Park Regency in Chicago, the Embarcadero Hyatt in San Francisco, The Hyatt in Ft. Lauderdale). 
As for the Century City Plaza Hyatt? The View was great. But I won't be back until they fire the hotel manager and refurbish the place...especially the Penthouses. For goodness sakes, this is Century City, and it's the Plaza Hotel.

"Under-wowed by this Hilton
Hotel is located across the street from China Town...financial district a few blocks up. Older hotel that has been redecorated...room is decent. Location was great for getting a daily dose of exercise...able to walk to China Town, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf, & Union Square area in under 30 minutes. Stayed on the 23rd Floor (Executive Floor) with a good view. While there over the 4th of July, carpet in the hall was replaced & the next day the windows were cleaned from the inside-out...so access to the room was necessary. Not told this would be the case upon making reservations. A letter was slipped under the door during the night the day before. Even on the 23rd floor the room can be noisy but the hotel provides earplugs on the nightstand...how nice of them (sarcasm). The pillows were horrible...immediately went flat & 4 pillows to prop up against still did not provide enough support. The bath cloths were thin & the towels were just ok, not soft or thick. Internet access, wired or wireless is $10 a day. After arriving from the airport after 8 pm, decided to eat @ 750 Restaurant & Bar inside the hotel...food was ok...it was nourishment, overpriced. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL PRIOR TO CHECKOUT...we were charged a night of valet parking at $55...only thing is we took Super Shuttle from & to the airport, walked, biked, rode cable car, & took a taxi while in San Francisco...the only vehicle we drove was the GoCar (gocartours.com) which we had for a few hours to do a GPS talking/guided tour around the city...never parked a vehicle @ the hotel.

It wasn't perfect. I'd just been at a hotel that had a really kicking concierge lounge. The Hilton Houston North was marginal at best. Very limited selections. The restaurant was closed for dinner so you're left with eating at the bar. Luckily two buildings down there is a small strip building with several really good choices.

My friend who grew up in the area got us a room here for our family's sightseeing tour of Chicago.

It has a far more ritzy feel to it than we are accustomed to staying. We did use the pool and hot tub facility that they had, at which I was surprised by how small they were considering the size of the hotel, but don't imagine families are its usual demographic. Also, we are accustomed to free wifi and breakfasts and the hotels we typically stay, but imagine that isn't common in downtown Chicago without being a member of some rewards club or staying in a pricier room than we did.

"Colonnade Hotel: A list of pros and cons
Pros: 
1. Very nice staff - very helpful and polite. The guy at the front desk helped me figure out a run around the Charles.
2. Great location - right next to the conference center and a high-end shopping center, restaurants, in a very good part of town. 
3. Comfortable bed and pillows. 
4. Good water pressure in the shower. 
5. Pretty thick walls. 
6. Internet (once purchased) was fast and reliable for the time I was there. 
Cons: 
1. Biggest con if you're at all sensitive to noise when you sleep ---> Very loud A/C in rooms. I thought someone was vacuuming directly outside my room when it kicked in. I asked about it at the front desk and the guy told me that all rooms had the same loud A/C. I tried sleeping with earplugs but it kept waking me up every time it kicked on, so I ended up sleeping without A/C and waking up in a ~80+ degree room. Made it difficult to get a decent night's sleep. 
2. Internet is $14/day. Other miscellaneous add on charges to be aware of. 
3. Fan in the bathroom was broken. Bedside light was broken.",3.0,4,-1.0

"Just Close Enough to the Bustle... But Not Too Close
When we booked our 4-night stay at the Westin Times Square, I thought we'd end up in the middle of Times Square, which was exciting. So I was slightly disappointed when, on arriving there, I saw we were a block from the hustle and bustle of that area. My disappointment disappeared about a day in when the madness of the tourists flooding Times Square started to get to me. :) I was glad for the escape from the tourist trap! 
The Westin is very well-situated (with a Starbucks directly across the street, if you're working from NYC like I was). I couldn't be happier with the location. 
The concierge was very helpful when my husband and I asked about good restaurants to eat at, not just TGI Fridays; she recommended a place on ""Restaurant Row"" and then called ahead for reservations --- and the restaurant she recommended was fantastic! 
The lounge on the second floor is rather quiet at night, so we had a late-night drink twice there and people-watched the crowds passing by below. The service was pleasant. 
The only trouble we experienced was with the wi-fi connection and with getting reception on our cell phones. We had to move rooms the first night there because the wi-fi was so poor and we both needed to get work done. But they moved us without question, and the next room had much better connectivity. As for the cell phone reception, I couldn't text/SMS to save my life, but I imagine that has more to do with NYC and/or my carrier than it does with the Westin.

The bedding was harsh linen. The air conditioning was loud and did not stay at programmed temperature. At breakfast the next morning, I noticed most of the silverware was crusty. The server went in for a hard sell on the buffet (around 18 dollars) but I stuck to my guns with cold cereal. I was told to get it from the buffet and a check was dropped immediately. Nice. I will say they had a decent fitness center and it was clean and modern. I am not sure what this property is worth to Sheraton but it struck me, overall, as gross and totally turned me off.

None available. ""Ray"" sent me to another room so that I could dry my hair. NO hair dryer in there. Left to board a plane with a wet head...

Kinda odd that our upgrade from our status got us half the room our friend got with an upgrade when he doesn't have stautus. 2nd time that has happened to us at this hotel.
The rooms are HOT in December. Took arguing with a maintenance guy before he reluctantly turned the air on in our room. He pointed his gun in the air and said it was 65 degrees in the room......REALLY, I saw the numbers on his gun and it says 62.7. HMMMMMMMM No way in hell was it any lower than upper 70's in that room
The mattress are good. The sinks are small and cute but not set up for a man to shave, MINIMAL countertop space. Ice Machines are not on every floor and trying to get on the elevator is a LONG PROCESS. Better leave in plenty of time to catch the elevator, Normally 1 of them is always broken.
Our friends called down for their car and came downstairs and waited 25 minutes and the car never showed. They asked about it and the guy said he brought it down.....no he didn't.

Getting a TAXI will be IMPOSSIBLE for you!!!! You will have to walk blocks and blocks to get a taxi. I would recommend a different hotel. SO many inconveniences and they truly just don't care.

My husband came and to ask about some of these vehicles that had noone in them that were parked in front of hotel. He asked if they could be moved because it was preventing everyone from getting a car because they are double parked. She told him NO.
The young woman never realized I was his wife and I heard everything she said about him once he walked back outside.

"""$400 a day-No Way!""
We just returned from a 3 night stay with 5 members of our family in a suite which was booked through Sea World. Big mistake since my daughter booked the trip and thought the $1200 + charge for the room included our admission...NOT. But we realized when she received the email that this was just the cost of the room, we justified this rate and decided to stay here anyway because we have a special needs child and wanted to have as accomodating an experience as we could and who can provide better than Hyatt, right? Wrong! When we arrived after driving more than 5 hours with a 6 year old in a wheelchair with us, it was past check-in time and they told us our room wasn't clean yet. It took my daughter a huge hassle with the front desk and almost 2 hours for this to be handled. We used the $100 credit given us to eat at the pool bar while we waited. It really was such an inconvenience since we just wanted to get into our room. The ""suite"" was not what we expected from a Hyatt. The balcony had two really dirty chairs crammed together on it and there were bird droppings all over it. The bathroom caulking was hanging down around the front of the tub and they were told we had 5 people at check-in yet we only got a single bar of soap and one shampoo & conditioner as well as an insufficient number of towels. The front of the suite had a sofa for sleeping but we had to call for sheets and blankets and there weren't enough pillows either. Seriously, after making people wait wouldn't you do a better job of accomodating their needs? The coffee service basket was unstocked and we wouldn't use it anyway after seeing a regular old house roach crawling around in the bathroom at 6:30 AM and having it go into a crack in the bathroom floor and right into the coffee pot area adjacent to the crack. This stay would have been a complete bust had it not been for the great food & service at SWIM, the pool bar. We enjoyed hanging out there on Saturday and taking the two children swimming. Let me mention that while the pool slides are terrific, there were dead palm trees around the pool area, as well as black moldy yuk and pieces of concrete missing around the pools. I found this and the nasty entrance to these suites where we stayed, which were away from the main building's clean entrance, very surprising. Each time we entered or exited here, we had to walk through bird droppings, feathers and a mass of flying bugs. Incidentally, if you wanted to have your patio door open, you were out of luck because they have no screens on the sliding doors and if a child leaves the door open you can count on having a room full of bugs, as we did. Thank goodness for the Einsteins Bagels close by where the service was excellent since we didn't have coffee supplies the first day and after seeing the roach really didn't feel like making any! I travel with great regularity and had a much more positive experience last week at a Best Western for a fraction of the cost where I slept on a bed that this Hyatt couldn't touch compared to their uncomfortable lumpy old beds.

"Worst Westin experience ever
Honestly, whatever reviewers say really won't matter here. The hotel has the best location in Union Square and I'm sure the owners and managers are quite aware of this. Meaning they don't have to fix up the old rooms, address the paper thin walls, or treat you with any courtesy whatsoever. People will continue to book this hotel no matter what and they know it. With that being said, for those who have the choice, stay elsewhere! Here's a brief run-down of what my husband and I encountered:
1) We booked through Priceline and the front desk made us very aware of it, and not in a good way. We were put in the old building on the 11th floor in the smallest category of rooms they have. I actually have never been in a room so tiny. Even when staying in New York City. Literally when we opened the door to the room, the door hit the bed. We tried to change rooms, even offering to pay extra, but we were dismissed saying they were sold-out the entire weekend. It was awful. Even on the 11th floor you could hear the 5 man team of protesters who were protesting the hotel next door. I specifically asked to be put on a floor and room where I would not be subjected to this noise as I had read about it in previous reviews. The snarky front desk guy told me I was in an inside room so we should be fine. Forget that he put us on the side of the building where the protesting was taking place. It woke us up every morning promptly at 7am. No need for an alarm clock here. The bathroom was extremely small, and had a barely working toilet. The walls were so thin you could hear anything going on outside in the halls and including what was going on in the rooms next to you. Most notably those late-night sounds and knocking of headboards. UGH! Disgusting!
Other than the room issues, I became completely exasperated when the hotel did not let guests know that the Chinese New Year parade was going on that weekend. I was completely oblivious when spending a full day at the Farmer's Market, Ghiradelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf and upon returning at 6pm realized that we were completely blocked from all sides into entering the hotel because of the on-going parade. We were not allowed to cross the street until the parade was over. We waited in the freezing cold for 3 hours. I was furious. When I asked the lady who greets people who are checking in about this, her response to me was that they let everyone who checked in that day know that the parade was going to happen that day and that they may not have access. It seemed completely lost to her that maybe they should have let everyone else know too. I mean, how hard would it have been for them to slip a flier under guests' doors?? It's things like that that ruin even a good experience. But my stay was already marred, so I could not wait to check out and get out of there.
The only positive thing I have to say is that the concierge desk was always very helpful. And the location is prime.",2.0,1,1.0
"Noisy
Stayed at the 10th floor with a view on the street (but not Park Avenue). If you switch off the AC and fan, you hear the street noise really loud. Not a surprise because the double glazing was in bad condition. Might need replacement, affordable for the hotel if you think about the rates of the rooms... I called the reception and I was told that it was due to garbage collecting and that would stop 15 minutes later, but it did not stop.
Breakfast was good (real juices and good pastries), no problem with the service but I did not really ask for anything. The rooftop is nice for smokers I guess, as the view is nothing special (only buildings on the other side of the street). 
Complimentary wine in the room was awful.
Small rooms but I guess that is New York standards, I dont have much experience in this city though.
The hotel is really proud of its tripadvisor status (several signs in the lobby), which is overrated in my opinion.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Used room/terrible service
To cut a long story short our first room was not cleaned properly, half eaten food in the fridge and mud on the bathroom floor. After waiting over an hour for someone to clean it up and bring us an ice bucket, we decided no one was going to come and to switch rooms . Our second room and a try full of old food, right in front of our door. We asked if someone could clean it up and after arriving back to our room 5 hours later, it was still sitting outside our room. So gross. I will never return to this hotel because they do not clean their rooms properly and even if they did, they do not make any effort to help their guests. Totally unacceptable for a room costing over $200. The only reason I said poor and not terrible is because the valet guy was great. Oh, and the coffee in the WBC coffee shop was gross. Not anything like Starbucks. It tasted very sour to me.",2.0,1,1.0
"Marriot Marquis Time Square - not happy
Great location, rooms were a decent size- but may I suggest you use the safe! Checked in 11.30pm and did not put camera in the safe having intended to take it out the following morning. Forgot to take the camera out the next day and when I returned to the room, it had been serviced and the camera was gone. I reported to Hotel management and after repeated attempts to follow up have finally been advised (4 weeks after making the report) that the hotel believes they were not negligent and noone had accessed my room. Probably my fault for not putting all valuables in the safe, but not happy with the service regardless.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Very poor
Recently got back from a tour of the SE of the USA. My girlfriend and I visited about 15 different cities, so that means 15 different motels, spending one or two nights in each. I would say that the Queen City Inn was actually the worst of the 15 motels we visited. The room itself wasn't appalling - it was dirty and crumbling, but we half expected that and it wasn't a major issue for us. The real problem was the service. A frosty reception when we arrived from a woman at the desk who seemed completely out of it. When we went to the room we discovered that there was only one pillow. I went back to the reception and asked for another. A man was at the desk now. He tried to argue that the room is only for one person, hence one pillow. I told him that I had told the woman before that the room was for two people, and had paid for the room on this basis. He wasn't having it. Tried to argue the case that there should only be one person in the room, and therefore one pillow. Very reluctant to give another pillow, I had to really argue my case for one. In the end they sorted one, grudgingly. When we came to check out the next morning he barely grunted at me. When I said goodbye, the man at the desk flat out ignored me and looked at me with contempt. Left a really bad impression, and for that reason I advise other travelers not to bother with this motel. As a side note, their website is false advertising - the rooms are nothing like that (the website makes the rooms look decent, clean and professional, but our room was run-down, dirty and shabby).",1.0,2,-1.0
"The excellent Hampton Inn Staff
This was my second visit from UK to New York with my wife and did a fair amount of research prior to our visit. The Hampton Inn Soho had favorable reviews and after staying there I can see why. 
The most commendable aspect of the hotel was the endearing and friendly nature of all the hotel staff, we arrived early prior to 4pm but lobby staff allowed us to bag drop whilst my wife and I explored the immediate area which is profoundly different from mid-town where we stayed last time in New York. The area is quieter less in your face and very chic. There is an abundance of bars and restaurants to suit every taste and budget. When we arrived back in the hotel the room was ready as promised, when in the room it was spacious, airy and very clean.
 The size of the room was bigger than expected and compared well to Flatotel where we stayed on our previous visit. The wifi signal was good and allowed us to stay in touch with our daughter back in UK (who declined to come due to the extensive walking that she may have to endure!), and this made a huge contribution to enjoying our stay.
Every time we entered or left the hotel the staff were courteous and always willing to assist. On our last day of our visit lobby staff allowed us to store our luggage whilst we made the most of our remaining hours, they also arranged for a private cab to the airport which arrived bang on time - I would highly recommend this service as opposed to hailing a cab and only $5 more to JFK. My wife's main impression was the quality of the bed and bedding as she is a fussy sleeper - she said it was the best sleep she had had in a long while - so much so she wanted to change the pillows in our own bed to replicate the ones in the Hampton Inn!
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank ALL the Hampton Inn staff for making our stay a trip to remember and keep up the excellent service!",4.0,5,-1.0
"Extra charges for everything-Not worth at all for the money spent

The main issue was noise at night waking me up. The rooms are not that well sound proofed and I heard a lot of noise from other rooms.

Also the breakfast buffet was not as good as other hotels I've stayed in.",4.0,2,2.0
"Great location and helpful staff
My wife and I just stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a very quick one-night stay. However, we were very pleased with the hotel location, room quality and staff. The hotel is located right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile with immediate access to plenty of stores and restaurants.
The front desk staff was extremely helpful with directions and recommendations. In fact, every hotel employee greeted us with a smile and offered assistance. We were impressed with how helpful everyone was to us.
The room was comfortable with reasonable space. It was nice to have a separate living area. The bathroom and counter space was large enough to get ready for a night out on the town.
We did not get a chance to explore the hotel much because of our full schedule, but I would definitely recommend the hotel to others and hope to stay there again someday.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Always Great!
Spent a wonderful weekend in San Francisco (2/24-2/26). I am never let down by The Four Seasons SF. Great Location. Clean rooms/suites. Friendly and engaging staff. My only dislike is that the in-room internet service is very poor, slow, and often unreliable. I have been staying at this hotel since it opened and it has always had the same problem. They should consider not charging for the service anyway. Beside this one issue, the property is terrific!
The Sports Club LA is located within the property and hotel guests have full access to the club. This is a fantastic amenity; the club is really wonderful. The adjacent spa is terrific and the hotel salon is equally as great. 
The hotel restaurant and lounge are pleasant and pretty good.
You really don't need to ever leave the property. But, let's face it, it's San Francisco, and there is so much to see right out your front door on Market St.
Point off for poor internet in rooms. This is tech crazy San Francisco, common guys, get with it!! Other than that - GREAT!",4.0,5,-1.0
"Meh....
My husband and I stayed at the Mark Hopkins for three nights while I was at a conference. The hotel bills itself as four stars, but it really isn't. It's more like two stars. The rooms are absolutely tiny, the lamps are chipped and dusty; the water pressure is poor. There was a phone number scribbled on the wall of our room, in a fairly large way--like four inches high! It was clear housekeeping tried to clean it off, but you could still read it. There are only three elevators for a hotel of this size which meant you had to wait a while for an elevator. The location SEEMS like it would be a plus because you are on the top of Nob Hill. But there is literally nothing around and you can't even get a newspaper or a cup of coffee without schlepping two blocks down very steep hills. My husband and I felt trapped by the location. There is no gift shop in the hotel so if you forget a travel item, be prepared for a fifteen minute hike down a hill to the local Walgreens and then a twenty minute hike back up. The staff, while friendly, also seems a bit unprofessional. As I was checking out, the clerk starts reading all my charges out loud, as in: ""Okay, I see you had breakfast for fifty six dollars, you made a charge in the business center for twenty four dollars, etc."" Not that I had anything to be embarrassed about, but it was kind of surprising! I said, ""You really don't have to read every single charge out loud."" On the plus side, it really is pretty spectacular to have a drink at the Top of the Mark. We also had breakfast there (which is the only option in the hotel) and the food was good. Forget trying to get into the Top of the Mark after 7 pm, though. It is jam-packed with forty-five minute waits. Another plus: the beds are comfortable! All in all, there are much better options for San Francisco hotels, and we would choose to stay somewhere that was more centrally located.",3.0,2,1.0
"Location location location and that's it!
This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in for amenities and standards however the location does make up for it somewhat.
We stayed on the 8th floor, in the room was a very comfortable bed, small cupboard with 3 hangers, large marble topped desk (no chair) 2 old mirrors and a small shower room that suffered with mould / damp. The radiator only half worked and had been painted over so many times was as useful as a chocolate tea cup. This was November, Hurricane Sandy had just been and we were in the middle of a bad NE so we needed warmth in the snow.
Location, It is right on Times Sq really close to Hard Rock Cafe (about 50 yards max) and the subway network.

I've always wanted to stay at this quaint, old-style motor lodge perfectly located on Sunset Blvd in Brentwood. However, I will never stay here again!

Small, cramped baths and an impossible parking lot topped off my regrettable stay.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Boston Longwarf Marriott
Great location, great restaurant, great food! ""Arrived"" to the main entrance, door man talking to one another. Valet also just stood there till I waved. Front desk Lady was extermely polite. Went right away to the restaurant, waitress not that friendly. Asked Concierge for help, that was even worse. Spoke to us in a condenscending voice, this guy is suppose to be a Concierge! what a start at the Marriott.
Filed a complaint immediately with the front desk. To my surprise he was there the next day. I've lived in 5 star hotels since I was 10, my father would have thrown him out on his [--] for the comments he made to us. I guess everybody is entitled to a bad day
In any event, the next three days were more joyful. The Warf area is cool, and it is so easy to get to all the cool shopping and tours from the Marriott . 
The bar offers a great Beer sample Set, and Wine sample too, I thought that was cool. Food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. The Breakfast Buffet was excellent, and the Omlette Chef was supurb! Rates were approved over the phone, accecpt the last day, which doubled and half. They claimed hotel was full. Just in case I called the same afternoon, there were a few empty rooms. I guess they have to make money somehow. Book way in advance if you want to get a reasonable rate.The only complaint I have about the room, is you can here all the noise in the lobby at night. Our door was still in front of a wall, but our kids room was exposed to the open atrium, and it was loud. No reason to complain that night, it was the policemen graduation!
Fitness room is nice if you like to work out.

"So bad that Sheraton dropped them
I have only two nice things to stay, so I will start there: 
1) good location with friendly staff and 
2) the beds are comfortable (they still have Sheraton beds, although they are no longer a Sheraton hotel)
The Bad: 
1) The a/c didn't work in the rooms. Not only in my room, but also in the three other rooms management and the hotel engineer (very friendly men) brought me to consider as alternatives. First, they tried to give me a whole song and dance about the motors, how long it takes them to kick in, etc. When they realized I knew about the inner workings of an HVAC (these old units look like thoseinstalled in the 1970's/80's), they admitted that many of them just don't function properly. I guess I should be grateful it was October and not June. After two requests for a fan, they brought me one and told me to open the windows on the 21st floor. 
2) The tub and sink were blocked up and the Front Desk and Reception wouldn't answer calls from rooms, so after my first shower, I did not get another one, as the tub was half full for the remainder of my stay). Gross. 
3)We checked in on October 1, Sheraton dumped this hotel, effective October 2 and our checkout was October 3. Chaos enused. The internet never worked (except in the lobby), the front desk could not provide a receipt on checkout because they no longer had access to my reservation. I was told to call Sheraton and do the legwork myself. Folios were not provided under room doors, so everyone had to stand in line to check out (at times, there were 20+ parties in line and never more than two people working the desk). 
Summary: This is an old, rundown hotel, with ownership that clearly was unwilling to conform to Sheraton standards, and was then kicked out of the Sheraton/Starwood brand. The carpets are old and stained, the bathrooms tiny, the amenities barely acceptable, the furniture aged/beaten and the plumbing/utilities decrepit.",2.0,1,1.0
"Almost great
The hotel served as the center of our week-long enjoyment of Chicago. The rooms were clean and spacious and service was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, we needed to use the sofabed for a third adult and the quality of that furniture was unacceptable. We moved to a different room with a Murphy bed that was better. Alas, this room had no outlet in the bathroom and the one in the bedroom was far from the mirror so my wife had to sit on the floor to use the hair dryer. And as with most hotels, supplies of coffee were always for two, not three, requiring multiple calls to housekeeping.",4.0,3,1.0

"Great Location-That's it!
$205 a night for creaking beds, an air conditioner 1 foot from my head while I slept, and plastic pillows. Pretty much sums it all up. I didn't sleep well for the two days we were there. The A/C was so loud and hard to even hear the tv. Also, there is construction going on near the building and our room shade didn't close all the way. The construction elevator would go up and down (beginning at 7:00 a.m.) and if they wanted to, they could look into our room at us sleeping. The bathroom was clean. That was the big plus, but my first night there, I turned the shower on and the water was freezing. I called downstairs and was told to let it run for 10 minutes. We did and waited. After some time, it finally did warm up. I asked the gentleman at the desk how we might get a taxi. He said to stand on the corner and yell for one. We moved to another hotel for the same price after two days at Park Savoy. The next hotel was a 4 star rated hotel. Hot water, high count cotton sheets and close to everything.

I was told by colleagues who stayed on the other side of the hall that their rooms were oppressively hot and could not be cooled off. While taking a shower, the water temperature varied annoyingly.
While attending a conference, we were given an internet code to access wi-fi in the meeting rooms. Many of us kept getting a message stating that the access for our group was full with other users. Again, extremely annoying.
On the positive side, the banquet food was above average.

We got a Hotwire rate at this hotel over Labor Day. We saw the website and had high expectations. Yes, the hotel is in a good central location near cafes, restaurants, subways and Central Park. But, the room we got was one of the smallest we have ever stayed at in Manhattan and that's saying something since NYC rooms tend to be small sometimes anyway. We had a view on the 2nd floor of what appeared to be the fire escape courtyard. The blinds were down when we checked in at 3 PM which probably was the first sign that this was not as good as the rooms as you see on the internet. The bathroom was ok but the industrial stainless steel sink was tiny. Fortunately, we did not spend much time in our tiny room.
Staff was friendly at least. The free wifi was a bonus. Maybe the other rooms on higher floors were much nicer but I don't think that this is a place we would stay at again if given the choice.

Who needs a great big space in which to sleep when you are in New York? There is so much more to see than the inside of a hotel room. We probably should have had a larger room as there were two adults and two teenagers, but we coped just fine, even with all of our shopping. Bathrooms are dated but again who spends hours in them. We had a wonderful experience and were looked after very well.

"Rotten on the inside
On the surface, it looks like a hip and happening place to stay in. The ""hotel"" is merely an afterthought. Serving its bar patrons seems paramount over accommodating hotel guests. My friend and I stayed one Sunday night in one of its suites. In chronological order, I will list items of poor hotel management: 
1) No bedding was provided for the futon couch in the living room in this ""two bedroom suite"". 
2) The ""lighting"" in the bathroom was dim as candlelight and there was no ability to adjust it either by the sink and mirror or behind the door where the shower and toilet were.
3) The fixtures for holding the face towels near the sink (two separate rings) were both separated from the wall nearly falling off. The paint was gone behind one and the other showed a cheap patch job had been attempted and failed.
4) The frosted glass screen separating the bathroom area from the bedroom had a large crack running through it from a point where it'd been hit.
5) The shower had mold.
6) The shower leaked and there were an inadequate number of towels to mop it up and dry oneself.
7) The patio was grungy and littered. It had three small tables and chairs made of plastic and/or metal which looked like they were gotten from the 99 cent store. They were grimy. The large pot of the potted tree/bush had an empty cigarette carton and other bits of trash in it. The painted grey cemented patio floor was ugly and needed to be mopped.
8) Of three identical seats at the end of the bed, one had most of its goat hair worn off of it.
9) The lady's room in the bathroom in the lobby was awful - and it was visited in the middle of the day on Monday when there was no ""club scene"" going on.
a) the first stall, with the door wide open, revealed a clogged toilet and had no lid over the top of its parts.
b) the second stall had no lock.
c) the third stall had one of your typical metal ""garbage"" pails attached to the side for tampon disposal, but this one was so gorged with plastic bag linings not only would the lid not close but you had to wrestle and untangle them to find an opening to discard your trash and then stuff it back in the giant wads of plastic bags the housekeeper crammed in the bin. 
d) ""club"" music playing all day long in the lobby/lobby lounges so that you can't make a phone call or work in peace.
10) their complimentary breakfast in the lobby touted bagels AND muffins as well as coffee from 7am until 11am. But there were the following problems:
a) At 8:45am I saw that only bagels. 
b) There was only two inches of coffee in the pot and it smelled nearly burned. 
c) The toaster was missing one of its knobs. 
d) There were no plates or napkins. 
e) There were only three small cream pods left in a bowl. 
f) There was no staff present at the bar where the items were offered to ask for napkins, plates, or more creamer. When I did find someone to ask, the person searched and searched in cupboards in the lobby, behind the bar, could find nothing and offered me some cocktail napkins. I asked why he couldn't just grab a plate from the restaurant they have in the hotel. He looked at me as if he'd never thought of it before and didn't know what to do and if he could do this. I just asked if I could consolidate items in one of the big serving bowls to carry my two bagels, orange and 2 coffees upstairs because I couldn't juggle them all with cocktail napkins.
g) Of the two oranges and apple in the fruit bowl, the apple had a large bruise and one of the oranges had a mushy area under a large enough area of its peel that I expected it was rotten inside.
11) The staff, although polite, give the impression that they don't take their jobs seriously and/or lack training in guest services. They are pleasant and helpful when you interact with them, but each time I did I felt as if I was a stranger knocking on one of their apartment doors asking to borrow a cup of sugar. They don't mind directing their attention away from what they are doing to serve you, but it always felt as if what they were ""doing"" (talking to other staff, or, perhaps, on Facebook) was more interesting than taking care of you.
12) Other details about the room I forgot to mention: the ""do not disturb"" sign looked like it had been smashed in an elevator door, there was a lid missing on the water well of the coffee maker, there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom near the sink, the hairdryer the hotel provided was grungy with clumps of dust on the screen on the back.
It's open for drinking until 2am and has a bar on the main level and a bar underground. It's a place to book a room and crash if you're too drunk to drive home from drinking in their bar. It seems that the only reason the 18 hotel rooms exist.
Other than that, the room did have some cool modern decor and nice bedding.",2.0,1,1.0
"Great Location but Horrible Service & Fraudulent Charge on Card- Awaiting Full Resolution as promised
I will update this review once I receive the resolution I was promised by the GM. I had the misfortune of staying here from 09/05 to 09/07/2012. This hotel was the only bad thing about my first visit to San Francisco, but I thought that it would be the BEST aspect during my check-in with Edwin and Hugo. However, things went downhill quickly. 
I found that my room could have been cleaner. i really disliked finding condom wrappers in the trash can, an OB tampon wrapper on the floor, and a filthy rag on top of the AC unit. However, I would have let everything slide if housekeeping would not have been rude. I had called to request forgotten toiletries, and was given a stern lecture by Rimel once he arrived an hour later. I was chided for asking for too many items, but he would hear no reasoning from me. So if you stay here, be aware that they give TUBES of toothpaste, not packets. This may save you from beiing treated like you are that poor that you have to rely on the Holiday Inn to supply your toothpaste.
The preceding was the beginning of a downhill spiral for me & my family at this hotel. I spent hours dealing with management about the lack of respect that I was shown, but things kept getting worse. The slow internet was an afterthought for me when compared to the my dealings at this hotel, including my little one hearing restaurant employee Hector (who I never even dealt with) call me a derogatory name. Management (not the GM) told me ""at least the meal was free"" when I spoke of this issue. Itwas evident that management thought that gradual discounts would pacify me, but all I wanted was respect. I felt like I was purchasing a car when dealing with this hotel, but the product that we were negotiating was to be treated right. I did get the respect that I am used to from traveling 100+ nights per year once I checked in somewhere else. 
Three days after checking out of the hotel, I was stunned to learned that the night that was supposed to be free was mysteriously charged to the card. They went back on their word! I immediately called my bank to close the card. I finally did get GM Sheila Martin on the phone, and she was sympathetic and understanding, but also unaware that I had any issues. She did agree to refund my entire stay, and called back to confirm. However, the card they issued the credit on is closed (due to the unauthorized charge for one night from them). My bank said that it will not go through, and I have to give them my new card number. At this point, I only feel comfortable talking to the GM. I'm hoping that I can get this resolved soon, and will update my review once this is resolved. 
In closing, the only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. Any good experiences were mostly marred by the bad. As a professional who stays in hotels over 100 nights per year, I was deeply disappointed with my experience here.",1.0,2,-1.0

"Dirty and smelly
We stayed at the La Quinta Jacksonville Orange Park last night, and we really wished we hadnât had a non-refundable reservation or we wouldâve left. The first impression wasnât good, itâs kind of hidden behind a maze of other hotels (that we wished we could have switched to). Thereâs a Country Inn and a Super 8 all sharing the same parking lot, so we couldnât tell which units went with which hotel. Once we found the front door, way in the back behind the other hotels, the entry area is clean enough and the desk staff was very nice, so we started to think it would all be fine. But the first room they gave us was way in the back of the farthest unit, which I donât really understand as the hotel seemed to be fairly empty. But we opened the door and basically turned around without putting down our bags, it reeked of cigarette smoke and mold. They moved us to another room on the other end of the hotel, in front of the little pool. It too smelled of mold, like a damp, musty basement, and some other chemical-like smell, we guessed probably pesticide. It was late and we convinced ourselves it would be fine to just sleep. Over the next couple of hours until we went to sleep we found long hairs on the dresser (not ours), cigarette ashes in the wastebasket, and questionable crusty stains on both the chairs. I couldnât get the smell out of my nose all night, and couldnât wait to get out of there in the morning.
There are so many choices right in the area, do your self a favor and go elsewhere.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Every hotel needs a manager like Mr. Katz
Prior to our stay I had call the hotel manager to ask a simple question. He called my cell phone back within the hour and was very helpful. Upon check in the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The lobby was clean and very quaint. Our room was a simple room w/ 2 double beds. The rooms are a bit dated but very, very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable! The location of the hotel was perfect! Once out the door of the hotel the world of Time's Square was at our fingertips!

The good point is that the bed was comfortable and the price was good for a one night stay passing through.",2.0,1,1.0
"Won't be staying here again
We had stayed here once before to attend a performance at Toby's Dinner Theater. The theater and performance were great, no complaints there. The hotel, on the other hand, was a sad disappointment this time. I made the reservations almost 2 months prior to our stay for a birthday gift for my husband. I called the morning of our scheduled arrival to ask a couple of questions about our reservation (arrival time, etc.), the clerk who answered found my reservation and everything was set to go. An hour before we were scheduled to leave I missed a call from the hotel manager who left a voicemail asking to confirm my reservation (thought I did that in the morning???). I returned the call 30 minutes later to find that my reservation had been cancelled and the hotel was now sold out. This clerk was very rude, kept interrupting me as I was trying to find out what happened and when I asked her to find us a room in a nearby hotel, she hung up on me. I called the 1-800 number for Best Western to file a complaint only to find that they would not honor my reservation, but could offer me a more expensive room across town at one of their other locations. I thanked her and told her I won't be staying with Best Western anymore. An hour later the hotel manager called back to tell me that they had a ""cancellation"" and could offer me a smoking room. When we arrived, they asked for an additional $100 deposit!! The hallway on the smoking floor was hot and uncomfortably dingy. The room had stains on the carpet, the beds were sloppily made, filthy fingerprints all over the bathroom door. The room keys wouldn't open the outside door after hours, only one room key opened the room. The beds were old and worn. The view of the Baltimore ghetto was unpleasant. Very, very disappointed. I definitely won't be staying here again. I would gladly attend Toby's, though, just stay somewhere else!",1.0,2,-1.0
"Quiet Hotel close to San Diego
Would have rated it higher but blanket on bed had skid mark on it. The front desk person immediatelty brought us a new blanket. The hotel was very quiet and in good condition. It is on a main street, but it was quiet. Overall, great price for family on a budget and very close to San Diego. Close to stores and restaurants and plenty of fast food places for families. Had a great time and front desk personnel was very helpful. We did not use the shuttle, but it would be great if you need transportation to and from the airport for a per person fee. Also, shuttle to San Diego if you don't have a car. 
Breakfast was okay, but the staff was very slow on refilling items like milk, hot water, etc. People were waiting and arrived before 9:00 am for breakfast and the staff was laughing and talking in the back and not paying attention as items ran out. They brought out milk and before the families could get it they pulled it and took it back. I don't think they should pull items when people were waiting before closing time on them to fill items. So they are cheap on providing items for breakfast. Only fruit was small oranges and apples. Had the waffles and a couple of cereals with apple and orange juice. 
Overall, good hotel at decent price for traveling families!",2.0,3,-1.0
"Awful Neighborhood-You Will Not Get A Good Nights Sleep
Room 541
This hotel is located in a terrible neighborhood, 10 minutes away from downtown, next to a subway.
There were fights below my window at the bus stop in the afternoon and at night when the bar let out. 
The subway train went by my window every 5-10 minutes until 6-7pm and then every 30 minutes until midnight. It would start up again around 4:30am.
The street itself was very busy with buses and heavy traffic. Cop cars and fire trucks went blaring by every other hour or so all night and day.
The bed was alright but the sheets were scratchy and I needed to pile on the extra blanket to keep warm.
They do not replace the soaps at all. I understand not doing so for a 2 day stay but this is unacceptable for a 4 day stay.
No HBO or HDTV to soften the blow of staying here.
The ""sports"" bar was overpriced and the food was ok at best and took a long time to get to us. (I will say this, bartender Lamar was the one saving grace for this establishment, he made us feel welcome and profusely apologized for the delay, even though it wasn't his fault)
Bottom line : If you are going to attend a convention at the McCormick DO NOT STAY HERE!

I booked this trip thru Expedia. I told the person I talked to we were senior citizens and if they offered a discount she said yes. We were offered a 20% discount the total was 186.00 with the discount. When I booked the room I was asked if I wanted double beds or a queen, I said queen. I was told they only had 1 room left which was a queen I booked it. When we arrived we were told they didn't have the queen and upgraded us to a double which was OK with us. When we went to room number 369 It looked clean until I went to take a shower, the shower didn't work right,the tub had cracks,we didn't have face clothes,also the ironing board was broke and when we looked out the window all we saw was a small roof with dirty clothes on it no view also someone was screaming in the hall at midnight for about half hour the air conditioner was noisy.

"Would have stayed somewhere else if I had my choice.
Arrived with a large group of teenagers (4 to a room) and parents. Once we got to our rooms which seemed to take FOREVER because one of 2 elevators were working near the front desk with another at a different end of the lobby and yet 2 more at another location but wouldn't connect me to my part of the building, I found its initial appearance to be rather nice. The room was neat and clean including the bathroom. The sleep number bed worked in my room while others on my trip either didn't have one or couldn't manage to get it to work. I actually heard a story of someone who attempted to use theirs but when they tried to inflate the bed it wouldn't stop inflating and they actually had to unplug it. I was told of showers that didn't have hot water but the bathroom sink did (confusing), people not being able to get towels etc. I attempted to plug my cpap maching in on the table by the bed but couldn't find an outlet. I had to plug it in on the other side of the room and rest it on the bed which isn't its recommended placement for proper use. (cpap is for apnea for those who don't know and must be used to sleep) The wifi in my room was very poor so I used my iphone as a personal hotspot. When arrived to my room the following day I found my bed made (with new linens I hope) and towels in the bathroom and new bathroom supplies (i.e. shampoo, conditioner, soaps, etc.) which was very nice as the others were not empty yet. I did however take a shower the following morning and those new towels from the previous day were still wet. On the trip home I heard of the same issue, wet towels being given to guests even when they went to the front desk and asked for them. This was not a very prepared establishment. My parents once managed a hotel that we actually lived at and this was not something we would ever have done. I can't tell you how many times we had to put all hands on deck (including myself) and wash linens to make sure the large group we were expecting had plenty, even if it meant we were up all night doing so. I did see another issue that was very sad. In the area surrounding the board room and ballrooms there had been an event that included drinking. The following morning as I am going out to do room checks I see a bunch of partially empty and empty beer bottles along with pizza boxes etc. It concerned me that our students would have to see this. Why wasn't this cleaned up after the event. This didn't look good for ANYONE, much less children. I actually had a student who refused to walk down that hall to leave the building, he chose to walk around the building to access the buses. So many complaints from several in our group to list.

"Prime Location and Unfriendly Service
We chose Super 8 Los Angeles Airport Hotel over the Internet. Yes the tarrif was moderate but the reception hostile. Coming in from a flight from San Francisco, the hotel provides a pick up from the airport. There is a catch here - the shuttle is only provided in the morning till check out time. Should you have an evening flight, you have to make your own arrangement . While the staff are eager to provide you a taxi, they do not tell you that there is a complementary bus service to the airport from a terminal a few blocks from the hotel. The receptionist some Gujerati guy was positively rude. We arrived at the hotel, he refused to give us our room on the condition that we must provide some identification. We did hear him shout and swear at some of the employees who worked at the hotel. Try and avoid this guy since he is positively crude and hostile to the clients. 
The rooms are well appointed - big enough, nothing fancy, some of the electrical fittings do not work, and the staff are not particularly helpful. Dont try asking too much since the staff at the reception are unfriendly. 
A complementary breakfast is provided, but the fare is rudimentary. Most of the items laid out are in short supply and the staff take their time to replenish the food.

"Disappointed in the cleanliness
I'll start by saying that the employees at the front desk were wonderful, even when the city of Seattle only gave them a moments notice that they were going to be shutting off the water from 8pm till 1am, the employees were scrambling to get bottled water for the guests and notifying them of what was going on. The beds were quite comfortable and the air conditioner was great. The breakfast wasn't bad, a bit more variety would have been nice but I still liked it. The cons were: The room was smaller than we expected, the bathroom only had a small shower which couldn't regulate the temperature of the water as you were showering. There was mold on the shower door and the water was very hard to shut off. The TV was blurry like it was dying. The maid service wasn't very good, the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned, the carpet wasn't vacuumed daily, nor was the desk or the bedside tables cleaned. We would use the coffee but they didn't replace it everyday. The coffee pot was a ""fancy"" Keurig brand single cup coffee maker, they would be better off just having the regular motel room coffee pots since you can only make about 10oz of hot water at a time for oatmeal or tea. The door keys didn't always work and when they did they took about three tries to get them to work. The window didn't have a safety stop on it and you could open it all the way open...very dangerous if you have small children (we were on the forth floor). I feel that the price was way too high for the low quality of the room. I plan on coming back out to Seattle within the next 12 months, but I will not be staying there.",2.0,3,-1.0

I live three hours south from denver so, I got online to try and find a hotel close, but nice enough to entertain my family for the time I would be gone visiting my friend and her son in the hospital. I found the Hyatt Regency which is about ten miles south of the hospital. The hotel had a winter special and it fell within our budget. The room and hotel looked great from the pictures and they had all the amenities I wanted such as fitness center, pool, hot tub and sauna, the only thing it did not have was a contenital or breakfast included which would have been nice (concidering the price even at a discount rate) zThe rooms looked cozy and clean, I read reviews stating this place was a winner. Well it was nice and it did look and appear to be everything I hoped it to be, untill I went in. The decor is out dated, expecially the carpet, the rooms were dusty and carpets stained. The first item to appear on the TV screan upon turning it on was an adult movie pay per view screen (scantly clad women on the screen)( I have a child) and the towels were few, and not very nicly displayed (as I would have expected at a hotel of this character)The beds were amazingly comportable though, and probably one of the best parts of the experiance.

I see the hotel books that show the hotel and all the surrounding area entertainment /resturaunts, so I open it up to try and find a place to eat and what do I see every mens escort service phone number, mens nudy clubs and strip joints...

My husband and I stayed at ink48 4/28/12. We wanted to stay there be cause of the very positive experience we had at the Baltimore, MD Kimpton. When we arrived it was past check in time, which at 3:00. We were thanked for choosing their hotel and then told that our room was not ready. So we stood at the front desk waiting and then the clerk suggested we go to the bar and have a drink. I just wanted to settle into the room, and besides, I don't drink. So I was not happy with her suggestion. We finally got up to our room and I was not very impressed with the decor. It was nothing like the Baltimore Kimpton. It was clean however. The bed was low to the floor and kind of hard. Not very comfortable. It had a HVC unit in the room which blew right into your face and was very noisy. Our view was supposed to be of the Hudson River. The pictures online showed unobstructed panaramic views, but what we got was a view of The Intrepid and some cruise ships out in front and buildings to the side. My husband thought it was ok to see the ships until their horns started blowing. It made us jump out of our skin! We went out for dinner and returned kind of late and all we wanted to do was go to sleep. When we turned out the lights, we heard a sort of thumping sound. We thought maybe we had some honeymooners next door or something, but we listened to the adjoining wall and that was not it. Then we realized it was rhythmic and then we felt slight vibration so we deduced it had to be music playing some where. That when on until 3:30 a.m. We finally got to sleep and got woken up at 9:30 a.m. by the cruise ship horns again. So we got up and showered and when I went to use the hair dryer the cord was so short it was impossible! I kept knocking into the wall with my elbow and I just could not maneuver it properly with such a short cord. On top of no sleep, an uncomfortable mattress and now bad hair, it was almost too much for me to take! We did not feel like we were bathed in luxury with a fabulous view. We were disappointed. This was our 24th wedding anniversary and we wanted it to be special, but it made me sad that we chose this hotel when there any number of hotels in NYC that we could have stayed at. We didn't complain about anything w hike we were there because we figured it would be more trouble than it would be worth, however, we did fill out a survey online explaining our experience and they took $100.00 off the bill.

My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento because I had an appointment with a specialist at the nearby Virginia Mason Hospital. The hotel is elegant without being fussy or pretentious.

The first night we stayed in a 5th floor corner suite with a lovely view over downtown to the bay. There is some street noise in these rooms. Luxurious bedding and lots of pillows. I especially liked the bathroom with its white marble and separate areas for shower/toilet and sink. French press coffee in the room with real cream and specialty tea are unexpected pleasures. 
We unexpectedly had to stay over a second night because of the need for another medical procedure and called the hotel at 4:30 p.m. to see if we could book another night. To our relief a room was available and when we checked in again, this time I asked for a room away from the street because we live on 10 acres and are used to silence at night. We received a complimentary upgrade to a more expensive room in order to be away from the street noise. While there was no view, the quiet fit our needs better for this night. I really appreciated the care and concern that the front desk staff demonstrated.
The public areas are warm and cozy with traditional Christmas decorations. The fireside room is beautiful, we relaxed there for a couple of hours after check out before leaving for the airport, and I could have stayed longer. We enjoyed dinner in the Hunt Club one evening.

Room: Stayed on a high floor in a king-sized room. Great view of the Bay Bridge and the city. The size of the room was standard (if not a bit smaller) than I expected. It really just fit a king-size bed. Trying to fit a roller bed would shrink the room two-fold. Amenities were good, room was clean & comfortable. Just wished the standard room was larger in square footage. 
Service: Great staff - willing to assist. 
Parking: Very difficult to find parking in downtown SF, so take advantage of the valet parking at the hotel, but at a rate of $48/night (in & out privileges). 
Overall: Probably would check out other hotels in the area, since this one didn't quite have the ""WOW"" factor I was looking for.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Great location with old school NYC charm!
Lets get something straight...this is a mid range hotel and not high end nor do they claim they are. Most people with complaints here are probably expecting the Penninsula at mid-range prices. Newsflash...hotels in NYC are expensive! If you are staying here, even for $250-300/night you are still paying for a mid range hotel. I have stayed here numerous times for business trips and have never experienced anything that was so negative that it would prompt me to waste my time writing a review. Now, I have experienced a room with an old/musty smell...also had a room that was not properly cleaned...but guess what?? I PICKED UP THE PHONE and changed my room! That's all it takes. Their staff is more than helpful and have always resolved any issues for me. The rooms are fine....the beds are comfortable and clean. The location cannot be beat and in my opinion you cant get a better deal. This review is from someone that has stayed here a total of 17 times!",5.0,3,2.0
"Excellent for my needs
This is the best place for all my needs in Austin. Staying South of I-35, close to the airport, away from the city's traffic and free parking. That is just perfect! The suite was clean, modern and I had a great stay. Excellent staff and very nice people staying there. It fits the bill, not a luxury hotel, not in the middle of the city, but a very very very short drive away. I will most definitely stay there again on my next visits to Austin. What shocked me more is that I was told that the next time around they would have renovated the suites! I thought they were in perfect conditions to start with. Truly impressed.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Hotel Airport best of a bad bunch
Stayed here when my flight was cancelled and after i refused to stay at the Holiday Inn O'Hare (which is the worst hotel in the world). The hotel is in a good location on the airport, is clean has a good breakfast and comfortable beds.The wifi is not free which it should be in a place like this but otherwise an ok place if you have to stay at the airport.",3.0,1,2.0
"Dirty & Nasty
I checked in for a 3 night business stay. Entered the room, it had a musty & urine smell. One of the first thing I always do when checking into a hotel is pull back the top sheets. I could clearly see the the sheet had nor been changed form the last occupant. The press marks from their bodies were still on the bottom sheet and hair on the pillows. I call the front desk, they sent housekeeping, about 5 ladies. They staired at the sheet, then staired at each other. One of the ladies moved a pillow, and a little black bug was taking a nap. I pointed to the insect, one cleaning lady said it was not a bug. Once she tried to move the bug, it started moving, more staring. All the sheets, blanket, mattress pad & pillow cases were changed. Along with a complete cleaning of the room was done, while I sat there.
The head of house keeping apologized over and over again. I told her that she is not the one that needs to apologize. The apologizes neen to come from mangement. I spend a least 250 to 300 days a year travling around the world, 3rd world countries and developing nations. This problem does happen quite often, trying to save a buck. Many policies from management is, if it look ok, just make the bed. When I mentioned this to the head of house keeping, I could see by her expression, that I was correct. 
When I woke up in the morning to take a shower. There were 2 pincher bugs crawling on the tile flooe in the restroom. I wiped them up and put them in the toilet. Pulled the shower curtian and a cricket was napping between the folds. I knocked it on the ground, and it jouned it's 2 friends in the toilet. I closed the lip and left a gift for house keeping. I can just amagine what else was crawling in the room. 
Management did call and do the P/R, B/S. Offered free meals in the facility. I turned them down, if what is crawling in their rooms, just might be crawling in their kitchen.",2.0,1,1.0
"Very expensive for an average, noisy hotel
I just returned from staying 4 nights at this hotel while attending a conference in San Francisco. The positives - very convenient location. Walking distance to Moscone Center, Union Square, BART Station, good restaurants. The negatives - very expensive and significant street noise - even on the 19th floor. I feel abused anytime a hotel charges for WiFi - $12.95 a day is absurd. Won't be returning here anytime soon. For that kind of money, there are far better choices in San Francisco with much more charm.",3.0,2,1.0
"Comfortable but noisy
I stayed at this hotel on a business trip. We chose it mainly for its location. The front desk staff were helpful and courteous. The room was comfortable and your typical hotel room.
The absolute best thing about the hotel is the free shuttle. It will take you anywhere within a mile, and considering the cold, rainy weather we had while in town, it was much appreciated. He took us to dinner and to our meeting. The valet staff was also helpful and happy to call us a cab or point us in the right direction.
The biggest downside to this hotel was the noise factor. It is across the street from Rush University Medical Center. During my 2nd night, I was awakened at 4:44am by a loud ambulance siren. The night before, there were almost constant sirens. In addition, the housekeeping staff gets started unusually early. My first morning, they started cleaning before 8am, slamming doors up and down the hallway. I heard every one of them; it was ridiculous. At 8:30am, I had to put out my ""do not disturb"" sign, because I wasn't ready to leave, yet. I can't figure out why they started so early.
I had breakfast one morning in the hotel's restaurant. The food was decent; the service was average and a little slow. It wasn't really worth it. Go out for breakfast if you have the time.
Overall, the stay was very good (above average, not excellent), and I'd probably stay here again if I had a another meeting in the area, but the noise really bothered me.",4.0,3,1.0
"Nice clean spot
Stayed on a Sunday & Monday, 2nd floor male dormshare. Overhead fan, window open, and extra fan in room blowing to help keep everything cool overnight. I slept great. Clean room, quiet, respectful roommates. Across the hall, in my case, was shower/sink in room where you could close door, and a toilet in a another room where you could close door. So, shared, but not at the same time. :) Shower/toilet areas real clean. There was also a sink/mirror to use in the dormshare room.
As far as hostels go in Denver, this is the best option I've found for sure. But, keep in mind this is not a ""traditional european backpacker hostel"", but a mixture of that and a halfway house of sorts for those of any age that need some temporary housing, however the latter folks may be living on a different floor than where the ""backpacker traveller"" type are placed. Everyone encountered was friendly. Also had a great selection of current area info brochures (tours, attractions, etc).
Real happy with stay! Would recommend.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Just book it!
So I stayed at the La quinta Inn for four days with some girlfriends. My stay was awesome. Ill start at the airport. I got in late from Chicago and I was assuming my cab ride would be expensive. I flew in from LGA. At the taxi stand the attendant will ask you what city. Once in the taxi the driver asked where was I going. I gave the address and the driver asked was it between 5th and 6th. Since I did my research I knew that it was. He asked which way would I like him to go. I said the fasted. He took the tunnel. The ride was maybe 20 min. And the fare was like $25. Wow! Cheap! Check inn was easy. The room was clean. Im glad I decided to stay in my own room separate from my girlfriends because the rooms are small! However it was really clean, the water was hot, the sheets were warm, the heat worked, no smells, no bugs. No loud noises. I have no complaints. I had the breakfast which was good. I liked the apple juice. The area cant be beat. Its on this block that takes you to asia! Your right off of the famous 5th ave. right down the street from Macys, Madison Square garden, The empire state building. Lots of gift shops, restaurants, little bars. The sub way is right there.

"Not as Good as it used to be
This property has always been a SA favorite for my family but I think next time we will try the JW. While still nice, the hotel is showing signs of age- Peeling paint in bath, chipped tub, etc. I also do not recall the noise from the hallways. Not what one would expect of a Hyatt property or really any property in this price category. The lazy river is till fun but it was full of leaves on all days of our stay - like it was never cleaned. The property felt like it was over capacity, especially on Sunday. There was rennovation underway on the grounds - Bobcats and workers in flourecent vests making noise. This was certainly not mentioned at time of reservation. The staff was great, however, and food at the buffet excellent. The gym is nice and the grounds are well landscaped.",3.0,2,1.0
"Excellent choice for the money
I read the reviews on this site and was not disappointed. The king suite was large and comfortable. The bed was super comfy. The breakfast was typical for a free buffet. The location was a bit weird...land'o'big hotels, but I'd stay here again for sure!",4.0,5,-1.0
"Ewww!...
Oh My where shall I start. I read the reviews before booking and thought it cant possibly be that bad, besides I just needed somewhere close to Universal Studios thinking it was in a short walking distance, although it's NOT. Be prepared to walk about 2 miles for that. The AC barely kept the room cool, and the place was as uncomfortable as can be, not to mention dirty and out dated as hell, dont get me started on the roach stalking me all night. The bath towels were stained, it stunk, no coffee maker. I had to sleep fully clothed afraid of catching something from the bedding as it was stained too. The only good thing about it was it had a fridge, even though it froze my soda pop. The continental breakfast was a JOKE! me and my partner couldn't stop laughing when we realized what they considered continental breakfast. To sum that funny moment for you.... We walked into a small room maybe the size of a small apartment closet. it had a fridge not for people staying there though. It was a cramped corner with a basket of the 99 cent store brand mini cinnamon buns, one coffee pot above the basket which didn't even taste like coffee, and half empty container of warm Sunny D. drink. My advise is spend the extra $30.00 at the next place!",2.0,1,1.0
"Lived out its time
The Congress Plaza, ideally situated in downtown Chicago, is a hotel with a long history. It is even rumoured that the place was regularly visited by Al Capone. The hotel breathes some 'old chic', but it seems to have outlived its time and needs urgent refurbishment.
If you want a good bed, clean bed linen and a hot bath in a quiet room, well that is what you can get. At least it is what I got. But do not look at the worn-out carpets, the paint that is falling of the walls, the below average plumbing, plastering and tiling, and so on. And internet at $9,99 ex taxes per 24 hrs for each device you have is way over the top nowadays.That should be complimentary in my opinion.
The in house restaurants are also average. Breakfast is relatively expensive at the Gazebo. Prices in Rafael's Restaurant are better fitting the quality of the meals served.
All in all this hotel seems to be over its top and needs urgent updating. The asset of the hotel being that it is located near university campuses and shops.
By the way, there is a strike going on for over 10 years now. The only thing you will notice is that once a while there is a picket line at the main entrance. But that is all, services are not interrupted. In fact, its more a folklore then a real strike.",2.0,3,-1.0

"Beautiful Hotel, but Rm. 2315 needs updating
We stayed the nights of 12-7-12 and 12-8-12. We originally reserved a $200 room on the 13th floor of the newer tower but, it wasn't ready when we arrived at 3pm check-in time. they graciously bumped us up to a $400 suite in the older 5-floor section of the hotel. Beautiful, Japanese-themed suite but, our Rm. 2315 is getting a tad long in the tooth and is missing some basic amenities like a dresser, microwave and refrigerator. 
(Hints: Elevate the mattress off the floor on a waterbed frame that doubles as a dresser. Place microwave and refrig on empty shelf in cavernous closet.)
Here's a list of the worn items that need fixing or replacing, and simple cleaning that's needed:
Both the shower/tub room and toilet room exhaust fans do not function.
Shower room wood door is not cedar and is peeling and mildew stained.
All bedroom seating pillows are worn/torn/stained.
Inadequate closet space to hang clothes.
The sink faucet spigot is very loose on countertop and sink pop-up does not function.
Room divider panels have multiple panes that are buckled and/or stained.
Closet sliding doors slide very hard in tracks (lube with wax, like a candle).
Toilet room wallpaper mildew stained and wrinkled.
Dead bugs in all ceiling lights.
Bedroom ceiling light chipped/broken.
Shower room towel bar very loose on wall.
Mildew in shower room wall tile grout.
Had guest services immediately change the original bedspread/quilt since it was dirty/stained.
We really liked the Hotel and our room though. Visually, the interiors and grounds are beautiful and personnel friendly and helpful. We'd stay again but, would never pay $400 a night for a suite.",4.0,2,2.0
"Disappointed
We were most excited about this hotel than any of our other locations on our previous trip. Well what a disappointment. It appears unless you look like you are dripping in money the staff are completely rude to you. The receptionist was so rude when she asked if we would like to pay for an upgrade on check-in and we stated no the room we booked will be fine, this did not please her at all! From the moment we arrived until the moment we left tips were expected for everything, including opening and closing the door as we walked in and out. Putting a towel on a sun bed by the pool, even when we didn't ask for help (quite happy to lay my own towel down). They just stand there and look at you for tips, then you give them a tip and they won't leave you alone. One day I had no change and was treated so rudely, and seriously the guy only waived a taxi over for me to get in.... geezuz. Next time we will go back to the Mondrian in Hollywood, not as stuffy as this hotel. P.S. We gave tips and dressed very well, but hey it wasn't Armani... lol",3.0,2,1.0

"Other hotels on the block better
I was in town for the Big 10 Championship football game 11/30/12. I don't like hotels with the electronic mini frig and if the $5 candy bar moves, you get charged for it. This hotel even had a couple more sensors on the desk for overpriced bottle water. In fact, all the plugs were occupied which lead me to charge my phone from an outlet behind the chair. Hence, I left my charger behind. I called a couple hours after check-out and Security went up to the room and found it. They assured me it would be there for me. My husband, who was still in town, forgot to stop by and pick it up. I called the next day and Security offered to mail it to me IF I gave him my credit card number over the phone (12/2/12 5:30pm). I was not comfortable giving my credit card number over the phone especially for only $2. I would be back in town the following weekend to pick it up. When I arrived a week later, the front desk clerk told me the computers were down and they could not locate the charger without it. The clerk took my address and phone number and promised to mail it to me. When the clerk learned that option was already offered to me by Security if I gave the man my credit card number over the phone, he was shocked and wanted to know the personâs name. [My instincts were right and the Security employee shouldnât have asked for my credit card number.] The clerk assured me when the computers were running, he would over-night the charger to me. Well, another week has passed and I have not received my charger.

"Nice place for stay-cation in LA, but watch the overnight parking fee.
I love the Kimpton properties, a fan of every single one i visit. I love the fact that they love pets (so much so they hi-light them with a sign at the door announcing their visit!), have a wine reception every night at 5pm (most I have visited honor a cocktail for non-wine drinkers, this property however does not), and give the InTouch members a 10 bucks raid the mini bar voucher (the red velvet choc bars are to die for!). The Westwood Palomar didnt get 5 stars from me on this trip for a couple of reasons...the first being that they wouldnt give a cocktail voucher for this non-wine drinking person (they have a bar that has cocktail service). In other cities such as Portland and San Fran I have been offered these vouchers and accepted gratefully. The second I have a huge issue with is the 35.00 overnight parking fee. The price has gone up since I was last there and the response from Matt the desk agent gave was that it was in keeping with the area's other rates. My reply was ""Be an example. Don't be a follower."" I took a set amount of cash with me for the evening and by paying this crazy parking fee I didnt get to enjoy the restaurant. They're parking is on-site in the basement. There should be no reason for an increase. Even parking off-site over night in San Fran was cheaper! Come on Kimpton. Your chain is better than this.

"Fine stay, but room for improvement
The Omni Chicago has a wealth of offerings to recommend it: unbeatable downtown location, a relaxing and sophisticated atmosphere, comfortable accommodations, and a staff that understands hospitality. If I were considering only my room and the foregoing, it would rate 4.5 stars. However, there were a few unexpected annoyances whose combined effect had me doubting I'd return. To wit: 
. a somewhat awkward check-in on the third floor instead of street level. I can't imagine most of us like having to schlep luggage down a hallway and up an elevator *before checking in*
. far too few elevators for a tower of this height, thus constant waits/packed cars at most times of day (both sets: street>3, and 3>penthouse)
. a vintage bathroom wall phone, positioned such that you couldn't avoid knocking it off the hook -- then had the tedious job of hanging it back up, always right out of the shower
. a family/pet-friendly atmosphere that was occasionally overwhelming: dogs loose in the hallways, noisy children everywhere, double-wide strollers blocking every conceivable doorway. I know, none of this is the hotel's fault -- but if you're courting that demographic, you need to have a plan in place to control it. 
. poor hallway acoustics that magnified the endless sounds of slamming doors and screaming children
In sum, I reiterate that the Omni is a fine property in a great location with top-notch staff. But I'd prefer to leave the Ugly American chaos of Michigan Avenue outside my hotel. That's difficult to do here.",3.0,4,-1.0
"Vintage Feel, Great Service
From the Airport: Takes about 30 minutes, which equates to a $40 taxi ride. 
Location: I personally think it's located in a great location, but that's coming from someone who doesn't mind taking public transportation around or walking 1+ miles. It's located on the corner of 3rd and Cherry. I believe the Cherry st entrance leads you to the front/valet area, whereas the 3rd st entrance leads you to a back entrance. Walking to pike's place market took about 15 minutes of leisure walking. All of the buses stop nearby with a 5 minute walk to get to the hotel front door. 
Booking: I booked once on $$ and once on points (50K/night). I think it's a little expensive in both dollar and point amounts, but in retrospect, I don't regret it.
Staff: They are extremely professional. On my first trip, I had a great, natural small conversation with the person checking me in. It definitely didn't feel forced from them. The second time I checked in, I was getting in around 11:30pm, so the guy checked me in as quickly as possible. The systems weren't working properly, but he mentioned that he had all of my info on file as a Hilton member and that I could just go ahead to my room, rather than wait for the system to boot up.
Experience: I was celebrating my boyfriend's birthday on my second trip. On my reservation, I noted this and requested an upgrade if available (upgrades for Hilton members are free when available). To my surprise, they not only upgraded me to a great room (top floor, end room, balcony, jet tub), they also greeted us with a bottle of wine! [Don't forget to get your cookie on arrival!].
Car Service from Hotel: I was a little confused here... when I called in, they said it would cost $50 to get picked up. As a result, I opted to taxi. But when I asked to get a taxi to go back to the hotel, they said they could provide the car service for $40. I guess it costs less getting dropped off than getting picked up. 
Rooms: The hotel overall is not your modern hotel. There's definitely a ""vintage"" vibe to it. To some, they may think it's outdated. To me, I think it's cute. Furniture is standard with a fluffy bed and sofa. The room they upgraded me to had a jet/spa like tub. The room and bathroom areas clean as can be, given it's a little old in architecture.
Entertainment: The tv is hard to navigate through the channels you want to watch. But despite that, there's a lot of channels to choose from. Internet is available (and for elite members, it is free. Just charge it to the room and it should be cleared on your bill.) 
Others: There's a bar available as well as a restaurant named Juno. As an elite member, they offered me a voucher for $8 to use at Juno. I took advantage of this during my first stay and got a bagel with salmon, cream cheese and capers, with a side of grapes. It was delicious! They also have umbrellas in the room for you to use during your stay.",5.0,4,1.0
"Not boutique.
Rather than stay at the hard rock hotel I decided on the ACME for 5 nights, based on the Stella reviews on here. All through my stay I kept wishing id stayed at the hard rock. Who on earth thought to call it ACME, a silly name, I just donât get it. Appearance wise it doesnât stand out and its right next to a grotty hostel. I walked past it twice when trying to find it. The check-in area is literally a room and a desk but hey its cool as it has graffiti on the walls to draw you attention away!
I was assured id be upgraded when I checked in however they couldnât as the manager wasnât there. I emailed him and had no reply. My room was a king on 15th floor, very cramped sidewise even though it was their biggest king. Two people would struggle to move around each other.
The water pressure is poor, the tap and shower dribble, very disappointing as itâs a lovely styled bathroom. Hairdryer barely dries you, itâs pathetic. The air-con is also poor, very noisy and doesnât give off much cool air. What annoyed me is that they advertise super fast blazing internet. This doesnât exist, just wifi thatâs only ok. I enquired at reception and the guy didnât know what I was talking about! Also, there is no âwireless audio system via a bowers and Wilkins systemâ like they advertise. I had a small cheap iPod dock. I had one window that looked into someone elseâs room so I couldnât have the blind up so it felt dark 24/7. The TV channels are also poor, no HBO or movies, just a basic cable package. Breakfast is basically a holiday inn express style buffet, good luck finding a table to sit. I sat on some stairs. In the room there is nowhere to put your luggage and no closet! Just wire racks with 3 hangers either size! 
Overall I was hugely disappointed and will not be going back, I paid allot of money, this is no way a boutique hotel. It is a glorified holiday inn express with nicer fittings and fixtures. Start scratching under the surface a bit and youâll see for yourself what I mean.",1.0,2,-1.0

The hotel was just ok. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't an amazing stay. I sort of felt like I had traveled back in time to the 90's with the decor and lighting. We had an issue with check-in and the hotel manager wasn't exactly warm, fuzzy or accomodating. I mostly just felt like she didn't care whether we stayed or left. We did eventually get the check-in figured out, but when we were on our way up to our room, another staff member we ran into in the elevator mentioned that the the manager was a ""peach"". I think having a manager that's not very service oriented says a lot about a hotel.

"Where do I begin?
Let's start at the beginning. I booked our room through priceline.com. I have done this in the past and never found a hotel that they booked for me in the River North area to be less than satisfactory. That changed on this trip. We checked into the hotel at about 9:00 PM. The desk person was friendly and there weren't any issues with check-in or check-out. We went up to our room just long enough to drop off our luggage before going out to have some dinner before calling it a night. I had read reviews on this hotel after it was booked, and didn't know whether or not to believe them. BELIEVE THEM! The room we had was SO TINY. A Ken and Barbie doll couple might have felt if was a fair sized room, but full grown people could never feel like these rooms are a descent size. Of course the bathrooms equal the room when it comes to being extremely small. One pedestal sink, one comode, one tub/shower. Two tiny glass shelves mounted on the wall which might be enough for just a man's toiletries. Thankfully my girfriend and I are not large sized people. If we were we couldn't have even both fit in the bathroom at the same time. There was shampoo, conditioner, and lotion on those shelves...but not a bar of soap to be found. The next day we bought a couple bars of soap at the Walgreen's down Michigan Avenue. Later that day when we stopped back at the room, we found that housekeeping had now left two bars of soap. Thanks. We were also fortunate enough to be placed in the room right next to the excersize room (probably their way of treating guests who book on priceline). So we got to hear every footfall of the people going for there stationary runs bright and early each morning. There are three elevators. Two were working. They match the size of the rooms. To put more than two people with luggage into one of the elevators is a stretch. The elevators are also extremely slow. Thank god we were on the third floor. We used the stairs more than not. The bedding was pretty rough, the air conditioner (which you can't help but sleep right next to) was very noisey, and the closet(?) was a small corner of the room with a curtain that went around it. The last morning of our stay we had no coffee in the room. Housekeeping was not very good at stocking what they were suppose to in the room at all. I did tip housekeeping every day except the last though. But after considering there being no soap the day we checked in and no coffee the morning we checked out, my normal thinking of ""anyone can have a bad day"" no longer seemed fitting. I use to not believe that there was any such thing as a bad hotel in this area of Chicago. This hotel changed that opinion. Here's what I can say on the good side for this hotel. The desk staff was pleasant enough on check-in and check-out. The location is wonderful. If you stayed there by yourself and only used the room for sleep and cleaning up, you might find this hotel tolerable. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Below Average
I've stayed at several La Quintas in Texas and throughout the US and this one is below average by far. The hallways were smoky, the walls were super thin, and the breakfast was lousy. For breakfast, everything was overcooked and the jelly was so old, it had hardened up. The biscuits were hard, sausage was greasy, and the food was far below average from other La Quintas that we've stayed at. As for the rooms, the towels and linens were cheap and thin. It was pretty noisy in the hallways with people screaming and doors slamming which doesn't lend to a good night's rest. And on a side note, the tv had prettty poor reception. The overall experience was pretty poor and really didn't compare to the other La Quinta's that we've stayed at.",2.0,1,1.0

"Please don't waste your time
First, I travel a lot and am a loyal Hilton customer. This is by far the worst Hilton based hotel I have ever stayed in. The pros: service. The waitstaff, front desk and maid staff are VERY friendly and helpful. But that is about all. This was my first stay in New York and I was ready for a small room but this room is ridiculous for the price. I could not turn around without bumping into my husband. The bathroom smelled of old urine. Another reviewer said that they don't provide enough towels. I was not that concerned with it before I arrived, but once I arrived, it was true and annoying. They knew two would be in the room but they only gave us one washcloth and was hesitant to give us another. The towels in the bath were dirty, and (for the ladies) they don't provide all the usual toilet items ( bath gel, shower cap, lotion). Breakfast was ok, but the dishes were very dirty to the point that they did not look like they had even been washed. We checked out and moved down 8th street to the Hampton Inn. The rooms had all the amenities, was twice as large, was closer to eating, sights, and 7 blocks to central park and was $50 cheaper a night. Stay there...stay anywhere but here.",2.0,1,1.0

This was my first stay at a Comfort Suites and I am now a fan. While certainly not in a garden setting it served my purposes well. The facility is especially nice. No worries about the bathroom being clean or if there are enough towels, etc. It is just a very professionally run operation and, in my view, a very good value for the money.

I would have given 4 stars but was overcharged for breakfast - hot buffet instead of cold. While not a significant amount of money it seemed to reflect the attitude ""He's on company expenses, he won't care"". It takes a small effort from the staff to observe, or ask, what has been consumed.
Plus: good size room, excellent wired internet (didn't try the wireless), good gym, business centre with free printing, liquid milk with the coffee maker - small touch, but so much better than the powder ""non dairy whitener"".

"Apartment suites very nice, but...
We stayed here during a recent conference. The apartment suites are huge and very comfortable. We had some trash in the room when we checked in, which the front desk cleaned up right away. We had some issues with the batteries on the lock system which kept us out of our room, but again front desk staff were helpful as well.
My one gripe. We accidentally forgot our prescription pills in the hotel room (our fault, of course) and didn't realize until we got back to Canada. We were in Seattle for 5 hours after checkout, and calling us after the items were found would have saved me 5 hours of driving back to Seattle and a day of lost wages the next day.",4.0,3,1.0
"Better Choices than this Hotel
I stayed here for a conference in March, next time I will stay elsewhere (such as the W) and just take a taxi to the conference.
This hotel is a typical large, busy conference hotel. It is also a bit out of the way with no stores or shops close by or places to run out and get a bit to eat. 
I stayed on the concierge level which was not worth the extra money. The morning breakfast and evening appetizers were not good at all. Your better off going downstairs to the cafe and getting a bagel. Also the rooms are typical, again not more than a basic conference hotel.",3.0,2,1.0
"Very Dissappointed!
We flew in from out of town and got to the hotel right at check in. We got to our room and put all our stuff away and left to make a wedding on time. We got back late that night to find that bathroom door makes a super loud screaching noise while trying to close it. This wasn't very convenient for our guests that came to our room. We tried using their audio block that goes through the tv to entertain our friends and found it wasn't working. Even the remote control for the TV wasn't even working! I had to physically get up and turn the tv channels myself. I decided I wasn't going to complain since this was our first vacation away from our 5 month old son. That came to a complete halt when early in the morning we heard dogs barking. The dogs barked every half hour. Just enough to fall back asleep and to be woken up again by high pitched dog barks. We complained to the front desk but they said that we were put on the dog floor. We didn't have a dog! I asked the man, why didn't you let us know you were putting us on the dog floor? Who in their right mind puts a wedding party on the dog floor??? The man said it depended on when we checked in. I told him we checked in right at check in. He just starred at me. With all the complaints we had about the room the guy did nothing to remedy the issue. I will never go to this hotel again. I might as well have just flushed my money down the toliet.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Adequate.
I was excited when i booked this hotel, judging by the pictures, it looked like we had booked a massive suite. However, when we arrived we found the bedroom to be so small there was hardly any room to walk around the bed and the separate living area was also short on space. The decor also seemed dated and not worth the massive amount of money we spent to stay there.
It literally is right in the heart of times square, if crowds bother you do not stay here, its quite a mission to try and get to the entrance of the hotel. 
Check in was speedy and the staff were pleasant, informing us that we had arrived on ""gang initiation night"" and what areas to avoid. The staff at the little cafe/bar are a different story. We were given a $5 voucher each to use at the cafe/bar, however they would only let one of us use the voucher saying that we could only use one per day. This was no where on the terms and conditions on the voucher. I asked for an extra strong latte, so they made up one latte, then a separate espresso and tried to charge me for both. I asked for an apricot danish and they gave me plum (????), perhaps they don't have a firm grasp on the English language.
We were also harassed into trying to attend a time share seminar, despite telling staff several times we were not interested.
Of course staying in times square, it does get quite noisy, lot of sirens and shouting in the street. We were also placed in the room directly next to the elevators but i didn't hear them so much at night over the sirens.
I would not stay near times square again. Its incredibly expensive and dirty, there is garbage all over the streets, and I'm sure there are nicer places just outside times square that would be more economical, cleaner and quiet.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Central, clean & compact
Stayed here 6 nights in June (am late in writing this up). Had a corner room away from the street. Took a little bit of getting used to the compact nature of the room, but once you do it's worth it. Very close to subway, within walking distance to Central Park and Fifth Ave. Rooms are cleaned daily and it helps to be tidy, but lots of hidden storage (under the bed). Comfortable nights sleep. Liked being able to open the windows. Shutters a nice touch. Good convenience store on the corner, and across the road from that. A quiet place to stay. Only downside was on the last day there were problems with the hot water so had a cold early morning shower, given the hotel was busy would have been good to get an emergency plumber to fix it, and reception quite blase (to the point of not really giving a damn) about it. Have graded service down accordingly.",4.0,3,1.0
"Nice Rooms.....But Lobby,Shops Not So Much
This is a downtown hotel in LA so not too much in the surrounding neighborhood even with the renaissance that is going on around the area. I like this hotel for the great views and location if you need to be downtown.
The rooms seem to have been recently updated. I have stayed here four times since March of 2011 - three suites and one regular king. The suites were outstanding - the room had been updated but did not seem as nicely done. Heavenly beds and baths were great, linens and amenties were good. All in line with the Westin brand but still one of the better Westins. 
Room service was good on all visits. Did have in room dinner with guests one night (full service in my room's dining room) that I had catered by room service - they did a great job but of course it was expensive. The steak house upstairs, LA Prime, is really good - food, service,etc....I recommened you try it if in the hotel. 
This is a big building, however most of the hotel services were effective. It can be a wait in the garage if you do not call in advance. The check in desk was quick and their were no problems.
I am not a fan of the lobby and shop services. The shops seem to have been there for decades and not updated. I went to the salon for a hair cut - very expensive and not a very good cut. Plus, they ""added"" an additional tip to the bill after I left - crooks - I had to have the charges reversed with the bank which was a big hassle. Another big issue is that you can not charge to your room at most of the shops as they are not part of the hotel even though they are in the lobby-mall of the hotel.
The work out faciltiy is good - lots of carido, free weights and machines. the pool is out doors and is nice but is not a ""LA pool scene"" which I liked but others may want more ""hip"" place.
Overall, I like this hotel but the rooms and hotel service are much better than the downstairs facilities, shops and services. It is a big 70's concreate design and not that inviting or comfortable for an extended stay. I would say this hotel is for business but not pleasure. As for the location- don't belive the hype about LA's new downtown scene. It is still pretty bleek after 5 PM and this is far from the LA LIVE development.",3.0,4,-1.0

My sister and I had traveled to Houston for a wedding and had stayed in an awful hotel the first night.

I did not notice signs of wear in the room we stayed in and everything was very clean. The staff was very friendly. The deskclerk was very helpful.

"Stay at Affinia Shelburne
My daughter aged 15 and I stayed in this hotel for a week which included five nights during and after Hurricane Sandy. The holiday was her 16th birthday present and I was hoping from the reviews that it would be a great hotel and the rooms would be as nice as they sounded as we would probably end up spending some time relaxing in our room at night after lots of sightseeing and shopping!
 The hotel is in a really nice location, mostly very helpful staff particularly reception and the room cleaning staff. We had a king size room with kitchenette which should have been great.
However, what really let the hotel down was the response to the loss of power after the hurricane. Despite days of warnings on the news to stock up on batteries etc, when the hotel lost power, the only thing the staff had to offer was a glow stick per room. Ours didn't work. There were some nightlights on offer later but these lit up a small part of the room and lasted about 6 hours so it still meant creeping around in the dark. When I asked if more lights were available, I was asked to hide the nightlight in my pocket as they had run out of even those.
Some guests went out and bought their own extension leads so they could use the sockets in the corridor but the hotel management didn't seem to consider buying any. 
I expected the hotel to reduce the price to compensate for the lost facilities but when I checked out and asked what reduction would be made on the bill, I was told they would check with management and the feedback was:
'you're lucky, other hotels have had to shut and guests have had to move'
'you're already on a reduced price' - not sure what this meant as had booked direct with the hotel??!
I was really surprised that the management considered this a reasonable and fair response to the lack of services - I will not be staying there again.",2.0,3,-1.0

"Unique older hotel close to the action
Joie de Vivre (similar to Kimpton Hotels) seems to specialize in older, vintage hotels that most people would characterize as ""quaint"" or ""charming"". Usually in my experience that means smaller properties and rooms that may not be up-to-date technologically compared to modern hotels (i.e. plumbing, heating/cooling, even room decor). As long as you know that going in and prefer or like those kinds of properties, you should enjoy staying here.
The hotel is located a few blocks west of Union Square so it is close to the action for tourists and if you want to get to shopping (the Westfield Mall is about a 20 minute walk south) and dining (although not that close to the North Beach or Mission Districts where the ""action"" seems to be now). The check-in desk was not as friendly or welcoming as I had expected especially since this was my first time staying here and I had booked a package and wanted to know what/how to redeem the extras (I was never offered this information). 
There is a small ""living room"" next to the check-in desk that is an all purpose room serving as lounge, bar and dining room. You can get a free drink of wine from 5-6pm (I believe almost every day) so that was a nice touch.
The room I received was really small----disappointing since it cost over $220/night. The bathroom was old but manageable and it was okay for the one night I stayed but not sure I could ""spread out"" if staying more days than that. Unfortunately, the most annoying/disappointing thing was that there was no air conditioning, fan or other means of cooling off the room except for opening a window (which backed out onto the noisy alley below). I mistakenly thought that the room temperature dial control in the room also worked for cooling but unfortunately it was the heating and only made the room more unbearable during what was a hot day (and night).
The morning breakfast was a buffet----nothing spectacular or that appealing about it and judging by the other 2 people there, not popular. I believe that you can get coffee for free at the bar as part of your stay. Because of the unbearable heat in my room, I couldn't wait to get out of there. Of course, when I checked out I was prepared to tell them my experience but didn't get the chance as the clerk couldn't seem bothered to do more than check me out and never once inquired how my stay was. Apparently, they must have a cadre of regulars who frequent the hotel so they don't need my return business.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Exceeded Expectations
This was our first stay at a Hyatt Place property. We were here for two nights around the R&R Marathon at the end of June. We had the room with king bed and sleeper sofa which was plenty of space for the three of us. I agree with the other reviews about the plentiful breakfast and friendly staff. (The breakfast really impressed my wife). In our 3rd floor room the view was of the Shell station next door. We did not choose the hotel for the view, but for the location.. which is only a few blocks (easy walk) from the Space Needle, which is where many of our events were held. We utilized the secure underground parking for $20 a day only because we planned to drive outside of town later in the week. Otherwise, we would have stuck with public transportation downtown. The wireless internet in our room was adequate though I was ""kicked off"" a couple of times. Our 13 year old daughter swam in the hotel's salt water pool.

"Short stay in SF
My friend and I stayed here over our short, 3 night visit to SF. I gave it a 2 of 5, as there is no 2.5 of 5 option. First off, the area is OK. A little further down Geary Blvd, away from Union Square area, the area gets sketchy. However, public transportation is pretty good in this city, so we didn't need to worry too much about the area we were staying in. My biggest complaint about this hotel was the lack of air conditioning. It got very hot throughout the day, making it uncomfy to sleep at night without the noisy ceiling fan on and the unscreened window open. Also, we were on the 7th (highest) floor, there is only one elevator, which does impose a 3 person limit (2 if you are carrying luggage)- if this rule isn't followed, you might get stuck. Room was pretty small. Overall clean. Continental breakfast was OK, although, as other reviewers have said, there was not enough space to accommodate everyone.

This was a great hotel. The staff made the stay. Upon check-in they offered to look for a closer suite to accommodate my husband's current need for a crutch, they recommended restaurants, and offered assistance at every turn.

For the Gaslamp district we were so pleasantly surprised at how quiet this room was. The small pool had great lounge chairs, umbrellas for shade, and, when we were there we had to pool to ourselves. We felt welcome and truly enjoyed the experience.
The only negative was the food and bar. I have never had a more expensive well drink with less flavor. The Mojito tasted like club soda with a mint sprig and the Mai Tai tasted like a kids fruit punch, far too sweet. Having to justify to the person taking the orders for room service the need for soy sauce for the Ahi Tuna and then wait 15 minutes to get it so I could eat my dinner, was irritating.

We booked for three people and once we reached the hotel we realized that the room had just one bed.

Adding taxes and charges, we paid over $ 600 a day for the room, without even having breakfast.

The only thing good is the Gotham Hotel is the location. Moreover, there is no reception, workers do not wear uniforms and when you do check in, literally, you donât know who you'll meet or where. The workers are young and good willing but lack the professionalism of a hotel of this price.

so,this is a tough one. hotel at check in was fast and efficient - we drove a long way in a snow storm, go there and were able to upgrade our room to what the call their ""executive suite"" - which meant you had a flat screen tv and some updated room amenities. we got into the room and compared to other places we stay in cities would say the room was ""adequate"" - TV was flat screen, but analog, no room refrigerator <which is usually helpful because of some dietary needs when I travel for several days> which meant I needed a good size ice bucket to keep certain things cold until morning; the room had no way to open window and was very stuffy <read below> - the towels were not luxurious but functional enough, the bathrooms were the tiniest I have been to in a long time <the door just ""cleared"" the edge of the toilet in swinging open and closed> - the ceiling was low - when I got into bathtub and stretched I hit the ceiling (I am 5'11"") - oh yeah - and the phone next to the bed was not working - - ok now onto day 2
I head out from room on Day 2 around 10 am - -get back around 1:30+/- and room has still not been attended - ok fine - so I sit down at desk to do some work and I hear ""drip drip drip"" - and get up , go to bathroom area - nothing in sink, then turn on light in shower/bath area and I see the ""drip drip drip"" is coming straight out of the light fixture above the toilet <good thing I left toilet seat open or I might have been wading in some of it>// so I IMMEDIATELY turn off the light as the ""light bowl"" was literally filled with water, go out to phone and call the desk to report the ""WATER PROBLEM"" in the bathroom coming through the ""ELECTRICAL FIXTURE"" - so I wait, and wait - and about 15 minutes later call and say: ""DID I MENTION THE WATER WAS DROPPING THROUGH AN ACTIVE LIGHT FIXTURE?"".....yes yes - they paged the engineer she should be on her way..... + 5 min: I open the hall door and askthe housekeeper to page the engineer or someone.....ok now +20 minutes I call again - the desk says the engineer is on her way - a few more minutes , and finally a knock on the door - the engineer comes in, looks and then mumbles something and runs out????!!! OK FINE - so I sit there and wait some more - about 10 minutes later engineer reappears with assistant - they unscrew light bowl and dump it out - dripping seems less and then stops - SO, the room above had a leak from the roof (<big snow storm nite before> and engineer tells me that I have option to move rooms - I GUESS SO - 
ANYWAY - to shorten this up - they do arrange a similar room on same floor and now I have to REPACK all my bags and materials, get the bell man up to help me move , let my husband know that room has changed and to call me before he returns from meeting - 
2 hours later - all set in new room - 2 hours of my life I would not get back
later that night - new room was even ""STUFFIER"" and warm that night ....if that was possible...
in the wee hours we decided to get up and check the actual wall unit - we opened it up <licky for us?> and took out the filter and the air started flowing better - in the sun, we looked at that filter and were totally grossed out - it was dirty and packed with dust and debris - we stuck our head out in the morning, caught housekeeping on the floor - who put in a nice clean filter - - WTH?! anyone got a maintenance checklist at this hotel????
Plus side : 
everyone was very professional, eager to correct the mistakes and front desk offered us some options as comps - we chose some drinks at their bar (reviewed separately)

My hubby and I stayed at this Marriott the Saturday after Thanksgiving because we had friends in town, and we were unwilling to join them at the Hard Rock Hotel for $299 per night (the Hard Rock refused to honor a corporate rate even though they had rooms available, so we probably won't ever stay there on principle).
This Marriott is beautiful, especially with all of the holiday decor. It's quite large, and there's generally a lot of traffic in the main areas. It's a super convenient location if you're looking to spend time on Mag Mile or in River North. We booked through Priceline, so we didn't end up with the best room (the view was overlooking part of the building, and we had two double beds), but it served the purpose. There's a Starbucks in the building, which is so nice. The beds are pretty comfortable, bathroom is decent size, and overall the rooms are above average.
Our interaction with the staff was minimal, but the housekeeper was lovely and the front desk handles check-in like a well oiled machine.",4.0,5,-1.0

"JW Indy
Spent four nights here for a work conference. Great facilities for our group of over 1000. Location is close to major sports, concert, tourist, and downtown eateries. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Hotel is a conference/convention design...not a swany resort setting as some JWs. Rooms were average size, good work area and large flat screen TV. Not much of a sitting area, one chair tucked into a corner with bad TV angle. Couple of our lunches were provided which were quite good. Had to eat lunch in one of the bars one day and had a terrible time getting my salad. Staff were very apologetic. Property is newer so everything looks/feels new and clean, nice sheets and linens. Other than the one problem getting lunch, no complaints or concerns, would stay again without any reservations.

"Three Star Hotel at best - disappointing !
Let me start by saying that I am a well travelled individual and have stayed in some beautiful hotels around the globe therefore I think my thoughts/opinions count.
This wasn't my first choice of hotel for my recent trip and it was with some trepidation that I agreed to stay here.
On arrival I was upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice touch - checking in process was acceptable. 
The general feel of the hotel is ""Tatty"" - the lift interior is scratched and bruised and the corridor leading to my room was littered with used food trays and wine glasses. Most of the hotel room doors had seen better days.
Wine glasses remained on the corridor floor for a 24 hour duration.
Entering my room took me back to a 1960's bedsit. The artex ceilings had seen better days and in places the paint had been renewed creating varying shades of white. The net curtains had a yellowish hue to them and were certainly in need of a good wash. 
The air vents were clogged with fluff and dust and the 1960's wooden interior had seen better days. The primitive double glazed windows had collected a lot of grime over the years and there was an array of dead moths/insects in the room which bewildering had not been cleaned up.
Breakfast 15 minute wait so went to a nice place on the corner - Rue 57.
The rate charged was well in excess of USD 500 (room only), and yet I was still charged USD 15.00 a day for wifi and USD 10.00 to use the Gym. In addition to this when I requested to use a computer/printer to arrange the boarding pass for my flight I was to find out that this would incur further charges.
This hotel is tired, dirty and behind the times - believe me, for the money they charge you can do a lot better in Manhattan. AVOID.",1.0,2,-1.0

It is very close to central park and there is a movie theater and shopping right across from the hotel. The room was very clean and spacious for a NYC room.

"A Good Stay for a Conference
Stayed here April 1-4 for a conference. The location cannot be any better especially I stayed closer to the conference side. Because I was there a day earlier and stayed at another hotel, I checked into the Marriott early at 9AM. They didn't have a king bed room, but was able to accommodate me with a double. The hotel is decent and pretty standard for any chain hotels. The area seems a bit shady (with a lot of homeless people, but that seems to be the case all over Philly) but close to Chinatown. I didn't visit it much, but loved that it's close to the Reading Terminal Market. Many great food options there. 
I ordered room service one night and asked that it be charged to the card I provided during check-in since my company paid for the room. Instead they still charged it to the card. I tried contacting the hotel after I returned but I still haven't received a call back since I left a voicemail. That sort of worries me. 
For my room service, I felt a little weirded by the man who found the need to have a whole conversation about my salad while in my room -- alone. He set the salad on my desk as I had asked and then just stood there telling me how he thinks it's best that the cheese and salad are on the side because he knows some people don't like them. I didn't have a problem with that but he prolonged the conversation by instructing me about the dinner rolls! He got me so weirded out I put the ""total amount"" on the ""tip"" line. While he was on his way out, he was still having a conversation with me about the conference. I just wasn't used to the chattiness. Otherwise, the food was great. I finished literally everything -- dinner rolls and all!
One thing about housekeeping that I find strange is this: Why would they provide me with conditioner and shampoo one day and then only a new bottle of conditioner and take away my bottle of shampoo? I usually bring my own travel size of products, so it's not a big deal for me, but I don't understand why that would happen.",3.0,4,-1.0

"Unexplained open room door & lax security wrecked my experience
I recently stayed at TRYP for two nights for business. The room was clean and comfortable (bring socks or flip flops for hardwood floor), the food in the restaurant was very good, and the wait staff were excellent. Here's why I'm giving a ""terrible"" rating: I returned to my room around 11 pm after a full day of meetings. That's when I noticed that there was no security (card reader or physical) to prevent unauthorized access to room floors. Imagine my dismay when I got to my room AND THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN! Not just unlocked, not just slightly ajar, but WIDE OPEN. (I'd pulled the door shut when I left and the room had been cleaned so I knew I wasn't the last person in it.) I immediately checked the room to make sure no one was in it and nothing was missing. (No one was and nothing was missing.) I was too tired to head back downstairs so called the front desk. I was on hold for 15 minutes. The person who I finally talked to said, ""Oh, that's odd. We'll send the engineers up to read the entrance scanner so we can find out what happened."" No apology. No security sent up to investigate. Waited up for 45 minutes for engineer and finally went to bed. When I checked out the next morning, I spoke with a manager who said ""Oh, the reader wasn't working. We'll get back to you."" No apology and, 3 days later, still no explanation as to why my door was wide open. I REALLY wanted to like this hotel.

When it was time to get two cabs so that we could move around, we only had to tell Jeff when we were departing and he made it happen. We occupied four rooms. One was much, much smaller than the others and difficult for the couple staying there. But that was our only challenge. Location is excellent.

Just recently returned to London after a great stay at the Andaz, on a trip with my mother.
We managed to get a very decent rate using a lowcost website, requesting for a twin room instead of a king size which was on offer. When we arrived at the hotel, we asked about this request and the gentleman at the desk told us that all twin rooms have gone, but they can put us in a large suite at no extra cost and have an extra rolled up bed in the room! The suite was large, clean and considering the price we paid, this was an absolute bargain.
Wifi, drinks in the fridge (except alcohol) and snacks in the room were complimentary, as well as wine and other refreshments in the Lobby.
Not sure why the other guest reviews say their rooms were hot, ours had a full set of controls for the air-conditioning by the bedside.

"Very dissapointed
I was in need of a non-smoking room that was handicap accessable and had two full or queen size beds. We had just arrived in Memphis and were looking for a room for the night. I had my American Express service help me with this. They called ahead to the hotel after finding one to confirm that is what we were getting since often these requirements are not listed on the website. She called the hotel directly and talk to a represenative and was assured that the accomidations were what we were looking for, they were not. When we arrived I was first given a regualar room with only one bed, then after I went back to say I needed the handicap room we reserved I was given another room with two beds but not handicap. After going back again I was taken to a dirty room that smelled of smoke and was told this is the only handicap room they have. All of there handicap rooms were smoking. This room was not at all acceptable. We were tired and had already pulled all of our items out of the car when we made the decission to stay in the room that did NOT have the accessability we needed. We did have with us a lift for the tolet but there was no way possible for the two ladies I had on this trip to take a shower safely. 
Other problems, a dead roach on the bathroom floor, a pill from somebody just sitting on the floor, the TV wouldn't work and had to be reset, the breakfeast was OK but coffee didn't seem to matter to the people there. 
The hotel has the appearance of looking nice but this experience was the worst I have ever had. When I talked to the person at the counter in the moring when checking out and told him how upset I was about the room situation he said that he was aware but all of their handicap rooms are smoking rooms. Everyone in Memphis smokes and that most hotels are for smokers. I am not sure that is a true statement but whe you say you have something available, and it is paid for, you better have it.

Chose this property for our one night stay due to its proximity to the airport. Terrible service at the front desk on check in --- waited 25 minutes while 3 people completely ignored everyone in line and made no effort to help out even though there were open computers. Person who checked us in told us they did not have king + double rooms even though that's what we booked on the Sheraton website. (Turns out our room was what we booked - go figure) Also no acknowledgement of SPG status. The room was spacious and good for a family of three --- but in need of some serious maintenance. Peeling paint inside and out of room, marred wallpaper, peeling varnish on marble counter in bathroom, cracked tiles.......needs a lot of work. Outside of building has scaffolding and is apparently under construction. We had a late dinner at Relish in the hotel lobby and while the food was okay/pricey - the service was horribly slow. So much so that we decided not to risk it the next morning for breakfast as we had to get to the airport for our flight. The other issue that arose was an emergency requiring all guests to evacuate the hotel and go outside around 10pm. A fire truck showed up - eventually - and after it left about 25 minutes later - people started shuffling back inside - with NO direction or instruction from management. Not one hotel employee communicated with the guests regarding our safety or gave us direction as to the evacuation. NOT ONE. We had to ask a food service manager what had happened once we went back inside. (Burnt popcorn in a microwave). Completely unacceptable. The only positive thing I can say is that in the morning, the shuttle to the airport was prompt. Will not stay here again and would not recommend it. Not sure how Priceline gives this property 3.5 stars. There are lots of other airport hotel options in the area that are bound to be better than the Sheraton Suites.",2.0,1,1.0

The positive aspects of the Millennium UN Plaza were the views and safe location as everyone states, but don't expect to have a clean room. Having stayed in NYC several times, I don't expect much when it comes to the room, but I have to comment on this one. Like another reviewer, we found that the counter tops were not clean in addition to the dirty paper towels left under the bed. The restroom had tons of dust on the side of the mirror and smelled of mold which proved to be annoying for my allergies. My friend and I literally purchased our own cleaning supplies and sanitized the room just so we could feel comfortable. If the room had been clean, I think we would have had a quietly pleasant time at this hotel. This one downfall is surprising given that every guest is a potential reviewer on the Internet.

I'm torn on how to review it, there was some really good and some not as great stuff. But like the title said, I was very happy with our hotwire deal to stay there, but at full price I might pass.
First off, the bed was AMAZING. Might be the most comfortable sleep I've ever had. Great bed, great pillows and blanket, just awesome.
Unfortunately it was quite loud outside our window for most of the evening. We stayed for one night before we went home after a Disneyland holiday, but it was Saturday night of Halloween weekend. Kind of expected some parties, but the music coming from whereever outside was quite noisy until at least midnight. And since we were on the 19th floor...can't imagine some of the lower floors.
Toilet was completely plugged when we got in, but fortunately someone came up pretty quick after we called to fix it. 
Only parking choice is valet, which is fine. But the number they give on your slip to call and get your car, I tried calling four times in the morning and it just rang forever with nobody picking up. Luckily it didn't take too long when we just came down to get the car in person, but a bit annoying anyways.
Drinks in the room were EXPENSIVE. Which you expect out of a hotel obviously, but this might have been the biggest prices I've ever seen. Knowing how much those beverages actually are in store, it was unreal. We never used any of them, but yeah, I disliked seeing those sort of crazy price hikes.

"Rooms and service are really bad
SUMMARY: location was great, but that was it. Service was bad, rooms were set up without thought (ie couldnt watch TV from the bed), bathroom was dirty and reeked of filth, and the customer service was underwhelming and disappointing (to put it politely). Save yourself the time and find a different place, there are enough hotels in the city in this price range that are far, far better. 
DETAILS: Stayed here over the weekend for a sunday night wedding that was taking place in the hotel. The location was perfect- right across from central park, lots to do in walking distance. But that was it.
When we wnt to check in, it took FOREVER. The line was really long and was not moving. Waited, waited, waited, until we FINALLY received our room. Room was a little shoddy - carpet was worn, furniture old and drab. I went to the bathroom and noticed that there was only one bathrobe and an empty hanger for the second with a tag that said ""if you take the robe on this hanger, you will be charged $100"". Well, I guess the occupants before me are getting charged $100... but why didnt housekeeping replace that robe? This was the least of my problems.
The bathroom shower was not clean - it actually reeked of dirt. Seems like they never scrubbed the tub or replaced the shower curtain, and years of dirt layered themsleves in the form of a film all along the inside of the shower curtain... was gross. 
The flatscreen TV was on the wall to the far left. But the bed didnt face that wall. And the bracket didnt swivel out. So guests cant watch TV from their bed, which is ridiculous. We needed to watch a movie while either sitting on the floor or on the one chair in the room, which we moved so that at least one of us could sit normally while watching. Ridiculous.
The clincher - the wedding was scheduled for 4pm. We stayed for two nights, and asked for a late check out at 4pm which I know they've offered to other guests. They said they could give me a check out at 2pm, but if I want 4pm, I need to pay the rate for an entire half day's stay! I couldnt believe it, I asked for a manager and explained that I'm part of a wedding party that was getting married in the hotel itself and we wanted the room so we could shower and get dressed, we'd be out by 4pm which is when the wedding starts. Surely they can accomodate that request rather than nickel and dime us for a whole half day when all we need is just two extra hours? Nope, no dice. It didnt matter that the wedding there was generating thousands of dollars in revenue for the hotel. They wanted the extra 150 bucks or whatever it was for a half day rate in order for me to have the room for the additional two hours. 
So, in sum, I wont go back. Theres a ton of hotels in NYC. This one was very expensive and simply didnt deliver. Waste of money.",2.0,1,1.0

Our first port of call on our first trip to New England. Most efficient front desk team. Our room was very comfortable and had everything we needed for a few nights.

Great pancakes for Breakfast took my mind off it - mostly! If I could ask for one thing, it would be for a second, quieter restaurant venue / lounge in which to relax. Clearly a lot of business meetings take place in the Bristol lounge.
The hotel is well-situated for those inclined to explore on foot the nearby landmarks and park. Peaceful bedroom for rest and relaxation. The air-conditioning was probably the quietest we have encountered.
On the day of departure, we over-looked a bag when we left the hotel's courtesy car. We had not realised it was missing when they called to let us know. To our delight, the driver immediately came back to our drop-off location to ensure that all was well as we embarked upon the next phase of our trip.

"Hairs in the towels and lackluster management; excellent valet/bag service
I really enjoyed what the personal staff did for my girlfriend and me during our stay. However, the management and administrative/desk staff caused more problems than they fixed, and this ultimately forced me to rate the hotel as 2 stars instead of 3.
My stay at the Westin St Francis this past weekend was a mixture of good and bad. The valet service and bellmen were fantastic. We had an emergency and had to leave quickly and our car was ready as soon as we asked. The person who checked us in on Saturday afternoon was excellent, and quickly gave us the best advice for getting to the airport at 5am - take a taxi.
Unfortunately, several things contributed to make our stay less than pleasant. My girlfriend and I were in town for a wedding and needed a hotel room for one extra night. The person who picked up the phone could not tell me when the airport shuttle operated. The lady who booked us the reservation also did not have this information. 
Second, as it was a multi-day wedding there was a lot of hectic running around that needed to be accomplished. We only had a few hours to ourselves the entire weekend, and we wanted to spend them relaxing together. Unfortunately, the hotel was completely unable to expedite cleaning our room. They couldn't even tell us when it would be ready by, except that it ""should be ready by check in time."" Of course it should, but if I'm asking you two hours ahead of time if you could clean it in the next two hours the answer should be yes, or you should give me a reason why you can't.
Finally, once we did get into the room, there were multiple hairs in the bathroom. There were hairs in the bath tub and in the towels themselves. This is simply unclean. What really bothers me though is the way the hotel responded.
I had to leave to fly an international flight very early in the morning. My girlfriend finished checking out later that morning, and when she told them that she wanted to file a complaint about the cleanliness of our room, according to her the person handling check out did not treat her concerns seriously and did not seem like they were going to follow up.
For $200 a night we deserve to get better service. Ultimately, despite the excellent service the valet and bellmen provided, I have to knock this rating down from 3 stars to 2, simply because of the way the hotel responded to an honest concern. That attitude clearly demonstrates a lack of respect for the client and a lack of respect for our business.",2.0,3,-1.0

Had spent the night before at a Radisson suites in buena park that we enjoyed very much for half the price, free wifi, free parking and complimentary breakfast buffet (no, not continental breakfast, real food). Granted the Radisson was a more hands on hotel but would stay there again before returning to the hilton.",4.0,3,1.0
"Nice Hotel but Understaffed
This wasn't a bad hotel but there was nothing that stood out either. The front desk is certainly understaffed. It took about 20 minutes of waiting in line before getting checked in and about 15 minutes when checking out (there was a problem on my folio.) Once I reached someone, they were very helpful. There is a small cafe in the lobby that serves coffee, drinks and sandwiches. I bought a sandwich (which was already made) but after waiting 20 minutes for them to warm it up, I cancelled. 
The rooms were very average but were quiet and the beds were fairly comfortable. The location is very nice...right in the middle of Union Square. Lots of things to do and see nearby. There is a nice bar downstairs and a great but pricy restaurant as well.
Overall, I would stay here again if I needed to but I will certainly look at some nearby locations as well before making that decision.",3.0,4,-1.0

"Weary at Waldorf Towers- Concierge Level a Sham
Booked a Weekend GetAway at the Waldorf Towers and horrified by the conditions. Checked into an upgraded room that was offered for an additional 99.00 a night. The room was in significant disrepair!! Holes in the walls by the bed, cracked chipped ceiling in the bathroom, stained curtains with sharpie marker on them, dust over a centimeter thick on the vents, used dental floss on the floor in the bathroom,and the best of it...... a hole in the floor. Called concierge and the lovely woman came up to the room and once I showed her all of the above she reported she was in shock and moved us within 2 minutes to a GIANT 2 Bed/2 Bath Suite with a ballroom sized living room. I was pleased once moved but found myself disappointed with the concierge level breakfast that is nothing more than stale breads, poor quality smoked salmon, fruit salad- out of a jar, poor quality coffee- burnt tasting. Sorry I like Matt's Coffee from Maine. It was just a really bad breakfast bonanza. All in all I was happy to have been moved.... but I ask myself this: What happens to the poor slob who gets that 1st room with the holes in the walls and doesn't speak up??? It just seems terrible to me that the hotel even uses that room at all... ROOM 2714 to be exact. Shame on you Waldorf and god help the poor person who doesnt like to complain. You will get what you get and Paris Hilton will say thanks as she builds her dog another 350,000 dog house. UGH.... Never again. I liked the Ritz Battery Park Much Better.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Brand new and sparkling
This place opened in May so it's new and off to a good start. We stayed in a Towneplace in Henderson NV, and liked it so decided to try another one. This newer one addressed our previous problems in Henderson. They added a larger closet to the kitchen area and the bathroom door didn't hit the bed, but in general it might have just been a bigger room. But most of all, the Â AC was perfect at this location. Â The vents didn't blast right in your face and the thermostat worked well. We were very comfortable and slept well, especially on the incredibly comfortable bed. Â As noted in our Henderson review this chain has a well organized extended stay setup. Also at this location, they had a great patio area with new, well equipped barbeque grills. We were here for 3 nights and wanted to give it 5 stars, but some service issues lost some points. Though friendly, the staff seemed disorganized. Our keys had to be reprogrammed everyday and this was a pain, especially when we came in late and had to go back downstairs. We were told several times to make sure we didn't carry the key near our cell phones even though we're fanatic about keeping the keys far away from our phones. And it wasn't just one key, it was both of our keys. Â One desk clerk said it happened all the time, the other said it should never happen. Another time housekeeping forgot to give us toilet paper and we requested more and it was delivered at midnight! Â They just need to work out some kinks in service, but otherwise a great stay.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Bring Ear Plugs...
We stayed in this hotel for one night and that was too long. We heard everyone coming and going in the hallway while trying to sleep. Yes, some guests were being loud, but some were talking while walking to their room or getting ice which was 6 doors down from our room and we heard EVERYTHING. If it is any consolation, our 4 year old didn't notice.

They gave us a new room and some breakfast vouchers (continental....) That room was dirty. A nice man volunteered to clean it, he was a very helpful employee. The room still smelled bad, and the air conditioner was noisy. The food was horrible, the sheets were dirty. The pool had no towels.

"Really liked this Hotel
I really liked this little hotel in LA. It is not the most luxurious hotel in the world but it has a nice feel about it and I felt very comfortable staying here. 
The staff are absolutely fantastic. They are so friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to help you in any way. 
The hotel is clean, rooms very spacious and have everything you need including a little kitchen area with fridge and table. We also found the hotel to be very quiet and got a good night's sleep every night.
The location of the hotel is excellent, right beside Walk of Fame and set in a lovely street off this.
There is parking available just around the corner which is great to have if you are driving.
Breakfast is provided which consists of croissants, pastries etc which was nice. Refreshments i.e. water, tea, coffee also provided throughout the day.
Although I did not really like LA I really liked this hotel. It is a great price and a nice little hotel with everything you need!",4.0,5,-1.0
"Read and Be Warned
READ AND BE WARNED ********************************************
We were very excited to stay at this hotel because of the great rating it got on Trip Advisor and great price. Now this place is haunts me in my dreams.
NOTE: I waited a few days to write this review because I wanted to remain somewhat impartial in writing this due to the aweful experience we had at this hotel.
 We checked in at midnight, due to a late flight. Parking was HORRIBLE to say the least. All the spots were taken, which would be fine if we knew before we got stuck by the dumpster. The parking area is very small and we drove to oneside looking for spots, but there were none. We wanted to turn around and look on the other side, but we had no room to do so! We had to slowly inch our way backwards up the small entrance to try park to the other side. We drove down the other side and went around a corner and up a small hill to find out that all those spots were taken. We understand it was late and tripadvisor warned us about finding spots, but they didn't warn us thay you will GET STUCK!
 We were up on a hill infront of a gate that is chained shut. We stopped the car slanted infront of a dumpster tow zone because we couldnt move anywhere. We couldn't reverse down the hill like before because there were so many cars. We couldn't turn the car around because there was absolutely NO ROOM. Additionally, we couldn't reverse down the hill because there was a tight corner and the cars were very close to the wall. We were stuck. 
 We went to the night auditor to ask what to do and he just stared at us with his mouth open, NO JOKE! I thought maybe he didn't understand english very well; which is understandable, but that was not the case. After I told him our story and showed him our stuck car on the security camera, I asked if he had any ideas for us. I asked it very nicely. He responded that he had none, and then he stared at me AGAIN. I said, I can't park in-front of the dumpster or we will be towed and at that point in the night towing looked like the only way to get our car out. He then didn't respond and went to go sit back down. I then asked if the gates would ever open and he said no.
 I kid you not, this happened. I swear it.
He then stared at me again and didn't even seem concerned. I then said thanks and walked away because it was no use to argue or anything. After an hour and a half we miracuosly got the car out by backing it up around the corner at 1 mph. It was the most difficult thing ever. 
We then went to our hotel room and we realized we didn't get the sofa sleeper like we had requested, so one of us just slept on the couch. I understand that we just requested to get a sofa sleeper, but we were disappointed because we doubled checked earlier that that we did get one in the end.
 That night I researched different hotels and found one, luckily, for our week long trip. In the morning we cancelled the rest of the stay and moved on. The morning gentlemen was nice when we told him we were leaving. He didn't ask why he were leaving, so maybe he already knew why or just didn't care. The breakfast was okay. There was a small selection of dry food and a waffle maker. I never really got a good look at the pool.
 When walking back to my room I saw a two little cockroaches scurry about. They were outside the room, but it was still a little jarring.
 The room was decent- there was a flat screen TV, good water pressure and temperature, clean sheets, iron, closet space, and wireless internet. The wireless wasn't the best, but at least it was free.
 I am still really dissatified with the trip because no one cared one bit about service recovery.
I know this may not be a big deal for most of you, but the workers didn't have name tags or comment cards. If you want to continually run a successful hotel you should always want to improve and be available. 
Would never stay here again or recommend. Be warned!! You might have big troubles here and the workers will not even care.
Thank you.",1.0,5,-4.0

"Awful rooms, awful facilities, awful service
The room we were given had a very loud and leaking air conditioner - which had obviously been leaking many times as there were old water stains on furniture. Sink faucet and taps was not secured, neither was bath faucet.
As we had checked in so late, we kindly put a waste basket under the leak. In the morning we packed our things, requested a new room at reception and asked that our bags be moved when the new room was ready.
When we arrived back in the evening, we asked for our new room number and the receptionist looked at us in surprise. Nothing had been done about our room, and our bags had not been moved. Luckily there was another room available. It had just as noisy an air conditioner - and of a level that woke you up every time it kicked on. The faucets in this room were also wobbly in the wall. The sink faucet was also wobbly that when it moved, water sprayed out from behind the wall and across the room.
Finally, the breakfast area was laughable. Six chairs and three small tables for the entire hotel.
I was glad when the whole experience was over.
No matter how cheap the rate - it is not worth staying at this hotel.",1.0,2,-1.0
"Not Hyatt standard
Booked two nights as I was arriving around midnight on a flight from LAX. The first problem was that every other airport hotel had shuttles circling the terminal. After 15 minutes and no sign of the Hyatt bus, I called the hotel and they sent it over. When I got to the room my first impressions were of a very tired property that had not been renovated in many years...Maybe some carpet and furniture replaced, but the bathroom looked original and what you would expect of a low grade motel and not a major brand. There was also a area of the room where a piece of furniture appeared to be missing. I then attempted to order room service and was told that room service had closed. Eventually after complaining, the manager said he might be arrange some Chinese takeout!!!...then I went to look for the mini bar only to find there was none. 
I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member and have stayed in many Hyatt's throughout the world so I'm aware of what to expect. Considering this hotel is located at a major international airport, the absence of both 24 hr room service and a mini bar is totally unacceptable. 
I accepted that I had made a serious mistake booking the Hyatt Harborside and was ready to check out immediately. However, as it was now 1am, I decided to endure till morning with no dinner. I checked out at 8am and moved to the Mandarin Oriental, which is clearly one of the best hotels in Boston.

"Nice Layover to Flight Back Home
We stayed here for two nights as we visited friends before heading back home after a long ski trip. The room was great, clean, spacious. We had the Deluxe King room with a sleeper sofa for us and our two small kids. The kids slept on the sleeper sofa and thought it was quite special to do so. The tub was really big which worked out well for the kids baths too. We ate at the Rialto Cafe a couple times which is attached to the hotel. The food was very good. We heard a little pedestrian celebratory noise from the 16th Street walking mall since we stayed on Friday and Saturday night - but nothing to loud to keep us awake. Overall we liked it there and would stay here again.",5.0,4,1.0
"Dirty and smelly hotel....I'm embarrassed to tell people I stayed here
I chose this hotel because it was pet-friendly and it offers free parking. The location is pretty good and the price is extremely reasonable for Chicago. In addition, the receptionist was very helpful and friendly whenever I phoned for information and also during our visit. All that said, when we arrived I couldn't believe how run down the hotel is. When we entered our building I was shocked by the dirty white tiles at the entrance and the dirty and smelly carpets in the hall and up the steps. Things didn't get much better when we saw our room. Nothing was crawling around and the bed was clean but it certainly needs cracks filled on the bathroom walls, wallpaper glued down and a major paint job. Also, when we looked closely, there were dirty corners and crevices.Ordinarily we would have turned on our heels and immediately walked out but we had a dog. I had no idea how I could go about finding another hotel that would accept him. We decided to stay and make the most of it. I always travel with Lysol and paper towels. I sprayed all surfaces and scrubbed the bathtub clean. I didn't even bother to complain because the dog would have gone crazy with someone else cleaning the room. I would definitely never stay here again but the parking, location and low price can't be beat.",1.0,2,-1.0

"Was expecting more from the well known hotel
We decided to stay our wedding night at the Brown Palace and my husband made a room reservation months in advance. Although our room was clean and spacious, we were disappointed in the customer service upon entering the hotel and throughout our stay. We had to walk around the lobby of the hotel (in our bride/groom attire of course) just trying to find the elevators to get to our room without a single staff member offering a hello or guidance. We finally had to ask another couple if they could help us out. Although the hotel knew it was our wedding night, there was nothing special about our room. Just a bottle of cheap champagne would have been a fabulous gesture towards newlyweds. We were told we would be 'taken care of' and I feel like we just stayed a night at the Marriott. Also, the shower in our room was extrememly clogged up and you couldnt be in the shower for more than a minute before the water was up to your ankles. I was just expecting more from the well known Brown Palace.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Location was perfect, particularly for the price.
This is a nice, clean hotel right on the Riverwalk. Some of the terraces overlook gardens, or another building. Our room was a 2 Queen deluxe with terrace, and the terrace overlooked the river and had a very lovely view - we were in room 637, and the rooms on that side of the building, as well as on another side, have the river below (it ""T""s at the hotel). We had travelled from Minnesota specifically to stay on the Riverwalk for 3 nights, and this hotel was perfect. The elevator takes you right down to Riverwalk, and there are restaurants and shops close by. 
There is also a convenience store a block away on street level - there is a bus stop there which has some not-too-great-looking people there, but other than that, it is fine. That would be the only negative; that one block can be avoided.
The hotel lobby is beautiful; people really pile in for the free breakfast and happy hour - 3 drinks for each guest, including beer, wine or cocktails - and munchies that often replaced our dinner. We would have breakfast at the hotel, an appetizer or lunch out at a restaurant on the riverwalk, and then often drinks and munchies at the hotel. It is a great way to save money, if you need to cut costs.
We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, and they answered all our questions. They have a book of menus for the restaurants on Riverwalk, too.
We really enjoyed our time at this hotel. The room had a fridge and microwave, nice LCD TV, and the beautiful terrace. Our rate was $110 a night, which was really reasonable considering the costs other hotels on Rivewalk. They do charge $14 per nite for parking. I also researched and found that there were ZERO bedbug reports at this hotel; some of the others in the area have had reports of them. 
 I highly recommend this hotel.",4.0,5,-1.0

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.Like many people i read all the reviews prior to going and was a little concerned.We had a room on the ocean with a balcony(128).Loved it!!!

"Nice, but check your bills
I stayed at this property recently. One night, quick trip and had a newly renovated suite. The staff were friendly and efficient and the room was pleasant, if a little eccentric (leopard print robes...?). Â The shower products, shampoo, conditioner were delivered by dispenser attached to the shower wall. I find this eco trend low rent and quite puzzling considering there was also a jacuzzi tub elsewhere in the bathroom with no bath products at all available for it (they were bolted to the wall in the shower).
I did a quick checkout eyeball of the bill the next morning and left. It was only when doing my expense report the following day I noticed an unauthorized restaurant charge for Sazerac. I called the hotel and they promised to investigate. A couple of days later I got an email saying the charge had been reversed. Great! Another week went by and I checked my credit card to verify the restaurant refund only to find an additional charge had been posted. More investigation and I find that I'd been billed for a $7 minibar bag of chips (again, not me). So more back and forth with the hotel to get that fixed.
The moral, nice property but check your bill as this seems to be a weakness.",4.0,3,1.0
"Impressed with service
Upon check-in we were upgraded to a ""larger room""...great! However, we found that our upgrade was actually a handicapped room. First of all, not being informed or not stating this upon check in is one of my peeves. Some probably like getting a larger room no matter what. Handicapped rooms are arranged differently (rightly so) with wheelchair access into showers (no tub), special bars, no counter space, etc. I mentioned this to the front desk not because I was expecting to move but because I think that customers should be informed or asked if they are ok with a handicapped room upon check-in. The front desk receptionist (Annette I think) was sooo understanding and very professional. She insisted on moving us to a room just down the hall which was one of their loft rooms. She was very customer focused and wanted to make sure that we were happy with our room. The new room was AMAZING. It had a large king bed on platform in one room, a separate living room/sitting area, and a third room with a large square bed/lounging area with projector for watching movies or tv on the wall. My daughter called it a party room. The bathroom was lovely and functional (plenty of counter space). The showers had large mounted bottles of high quality shampoo/products which is a great idea - and less wasteful! There were 3 flat screen televisions and the rooms were stylish and modern. The bed was very comfortable and included different types of pillows for varied tastes or comfort preferences. The sheets were of fine quality and very smooth. I did not get a chance to check out the spa or gym...maybe next time! Last of all, the valet personnel were exceptionally service oriented and friendly. Service, comfort and cleanliness are paramount for hotels and this one certainly provided it with a smile.",4.0,5,-1.0
"Close to interstate but maybe go on down the road.
It was convienient and looked like a really nice place. I got stuck in a handicap accessible room because there were no others available? I bet there were a ton of emties that night! The biggest deal was all of the long black hairs on the white tile floor, bathtub and even on my towel because it wound up on my face. The cleaning ladies would have to be blind not to see these. No where near enough parking spots because it shares a tiny lot with holiday inn express.

I knew this was an old hotel so I didn't expect much. The hotel itself is beautiful. Love the large room we had with two queen four poster beds.

Parking is way overpriced.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Down graded from my last review.
As you can see from my past reviews I am generally happy with almost all of my reviews. It usually takes a lot to upset me, but this CP has certainly done that.
 Our room was a standard room on the south side of the building. It has qualified for the smallest bathroom that I have ever seen. You have to stand between the toilet and the tub in order to shut the door. (see photo..taken from inside the tub). On top of all of this the area behind the toilet is disgusting. It looks like there has been years of water damage w/o repair. I wont even get into the large amount of hair that was left for us in the tub.
 I know that this is a ""historic"" building and I will give them credit for somethings being dated, but this was beyond the normal. I also realize that this hotel was built by a train station and I am not faulting them for that either.
 I am a Platinum level member of Priority Club. One of the benifits is an occasional upgrade, special gifts, acknowledgement of your status, and things along this line. On this trip I was not given any acknowledgement of my status, no offer of an upgrade(2nd time in 2 trips) even though at 9 pm there were still rooms available in the executive level, no freebies like water or drink vouchers.
 I am sorry, but I will not be returning to this CP. I have been very happy with the Intercontinental Hotel Group, but this hotel does not make the grade. I hope that IHG officials take a long look at what is going on here.",2.0,3,-1.0
"No customer service at The Hotel
I booked one night at this hotel for business back in April for my stay in June. When I arrived to the hotel at around 8:30 pm at night with my client (who had her own room reserved), the front desk informed me (in front of my client and other guests) that my reservation was cancelled because there was a problem with my card. I stood there dumbfounded that 1. this was even happening and 2. it was late and I had been traveling for 7 hours. It seems that they card I held the reservation with was cancelled by my credit card company for possible fraud (company wide, not my card only) and they issued me a new card. I asked why I wasn't called to provide a new card and wasn't given an answer. There were no other rooms and he was ready to move on to checking in my client. I'll save the 45 minute drama that ensued with me asking for an explanation and to possibly get other accomodations for that night. While I was on the phone with my credit card company to see what they could do from their end, he told my client he had a suite available if we were interested and she agreed to at least look at the room. As I mentioned, we booked 2 separate rooms for our 1-night stay and didn't really want to share a room. She came back and told me there was only one bathroom and it was in one of the rooms so one of us would be disturbed if they other needed it and we'd have to take turns in the morning getting ready. She asked the front desk if he would simply give me the suite since they cancelled my reservation w/out notice and he refused and said he couldn't do that. She asked if she could simply have her room and I have the suite. He told her he couldn't do that b/c he had given away HER room!! Now we're both speechless. In a matter of 5 minutes, he gave her room away thinking we were automatically going to take the suite when he offered to just SHOW her the room to see if we'd be comfortable in it. It's now after 9 pm, we're tired, hungry and realized we were literally going to be there for less than 12 hours. We relunctantly accepted the suite. The man working the front desk was rude, short and just awful. I will say that had this major issue not happened, we both thought the hotel ammenties and rooms were fine, comfortable and clean. I probably would have given them a 4 or 5 star rating based on location and price. I left a message for the hotel manager to discuss the incident the day after I returned and 3 weeks later, no returned call. I held off posting this negative review to give her time to respond. Based on all this, I would not recommend The Hotel. There are far too many other options in NYC that I suspect can offer the same ammenities AND decent customer service.

The only complaint is that there was just ONE mirror, excluding the bathroom and we had problems with the toilet running, until we fixed it ourselves. The room is a bit outdated - the TVs are new flat screens, but bring flip flops as the carpet and bathroom could use some freshening up. The beds were comfy, but had the gross, nasty comforters on them, which if you watch Hotel Impossible, you'll know to pull those off the beds immediately and wash your hands immediately afterwards. I left my phone in the room upon check-out and security was immediately on it and retrieved my phone for me from lost and found. Thanks to the housekeeping staff who turned in my phone!

I stayed at this hotel for 4 days while in town for a conference. The frugal traveler may appreciate the savings. However, I was staying here for business and honestly even if it was out of my own pocket upgrading to higher quality hotel would be well worth the money.
I get it that there are many older hotels in SF and I did not have high expectations. I honestly felt as though I was walking into a former brothel complete with the look and smell. Small tight hallways, loud doors shutting very close to me (all hours of day and night), very tight twin room and bigger but equally as akward gueen ""executive suite"". My first room did not have an AC and my second one had a portable AC which leaked water all over the floor. I had to run it constantly however due to the central radiator heat system (yes I said radiator). This made for a musty room and the smell was already poor upon move in. Furthermore I had zero view and there were very few windows in the hotel period making for a gloomy, low lighting, musty place.
In fairness the bed and bathroom were clean and the location was great but overall this is a 2 star hotel with the comporable 4 star price of any other city and honestly I rather pay $100 more per night to feel like I had a fresh air environment with light etc....

Stayed here on the final leg of a Travelsphere tour of the west coast of the USA. San Francisco is a fab and cosmopolitan place but I get the impression that accommodation there is very expensive which is probably why Travelsphere uses this one. Don't get me wrong - everything required for a comfortable stay is provided, if you are from the UK it could be compared with a well known no-frills budget chain - but I personally would have liked a bit more luxury to match the ambience of the city. The rooms are smaller than the average USA hotel bedroom; we were on the third floor and had a terrible view of a wall at the back of the building but I understand it's possible to get rooms (no doubt more expensive) with a view of San Francisco bay. The hotel throws in a free continental breakfast, but the breakfast room was too small and it was a free for all rabble to get something to eat and drink.........as I say, OK, but next time I'm in SF I hope I can stay somewhere better!",3.0,2,1.0

"Turned Me from a Doubter to a Fan
I was all ready to say negative things about this property, but have done a complete turnaround and now would not stay anywhere else. After trying three rooms to get a satisfactory one (see below), I finally got into a nice room. The important point is that the staff was profoundly concerned that I was completely satisfied. They continued to check with through my stay to make sure I was completely happy.
This is a typical Springhill Suites. Nothing particularly lavish, but very comfortable. A nice working area, mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave. The sofa in the suite is very large and very comfortable. Breakfast is what you expect for a free breakfast. The location is convenient to every type of dining and has a back entrance to the upscale shopping mall nearby.
Unless you want to complete details, you can stop here. But I would heartily endorse this property.
So I checked in early, and they already had my room ready. The first thing I noticed was the faint smell of smoke in the room. Kind of surprising given that itâs a non-smoking property. Well, I figured maybe a guest was inconsiderate, and after a couple minutes I got over it. I am not allergic to cigarette smoke or anything. But it was unusually hot for September, and after a couple hours the AC quit working. Just as the manager got there, it started working again. I was willing to try again, but he gave me the room next door, which I thought was nice. That room smelled like someone was still smoking in it! By my third trip to the front desk, I was afraid I was being a bad guest. Either that, or they had some serious cleaning and maintenance issues at this place. The third room was perfect, AC humming away efficiently and smelling clean and fresh. 
I ran into the manager in the elevator the next day, who of course asked how everything was. As we chatted about the condition of the first two rooms, he was equally surprised. He even mentioned they were going to shampoo the rugs and replace the curtains. That made me feel as though they were indeed serious about maintenance.",5.0,2,3.0
"Adequate and clean
We have stayed at this hotel on three separate visits to NYC. The rooms are small, but the beds are comfortable and the place is clean. We had a problem with the thermostat on the last visit, but it was replaced efficiently. Good value for the price paid and the staff is friendly.

Funky old hotel, has not been updated, but our room was clean , LARGE, and comfortable. It is a great location, and the staff was friendly.

My only complaint was that the pillows were thin, but my wife loves them, so it was a toss-up for us.

"Short stay at Broadway Plaza Hotel
My wife and I stayed at Broadway Plaza for 3 nights in late November. It was the least expensive of the midtown hotels we looked at. This is a small hotel near Empire State Building, about a 25 minute walk from Times Square. The rooms are good sized and fairly clean, with outdated furnishings. The staff is friendly. The only real complaint is that there is only one elevator to the upper floors, heavily used particularly in the morning, so expect long waits. The continental breakfast was bare bones. We arrived late at night at which time the neighborhood is mostly closed up with metal garage doors and barred gates, so kind of bleak looking and uninviting.

"Clean, comfortable, but really disappointed! Won't stay again.
I recently stayed here during a convention for 7 nights, over the July 4th week. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but service was less than desirable. My colleagues and I all shared the same impressions: below average food with small portions and high prices, unfriendly/aloof staff, and a lack of replaced items such as towels and toiletries. We decided to join the festivities for the 4th of July celebration offered by the hotel. Clearly, they were completely unprepared for the number of guests who participated in spite of knowing the number of guests staying at the hotel. They advertised food such as ""hot dogs and hamburgers"" would be available, which in reality was their regular bar menu- $10.00 for 3 hot dog sliders (small portions) and other bar menu items-which we waited over 1 hour to receive our first order and then we were told we could not order more because they were too backed up in the kitchen to fill the orders they had. We,(and many others) decided to have pizza delivered in our last night because we just didn't want the poor food in the hotel restaurant, nor the prices. ($9.00 just for 2 ice teas!!) Also, this hotel is located too far from the Metro to be convenient even though it is in a nice area. The pool was also a disappointment-just a small lap pool. Unfriendly service, poor planning, and not at all the experience you would expect from a Hilton.",3.0,2,1.0
"Some very cool/unique features
My wife and I stayed here on the last night of our visit to Austin. The hotel was very easy to find right off the freeway. I thought it was a nice touch having the front desk staff wear a traditional Japanese style clothing instead of the typical hotel uniform. The rooms look very nice and I loved the bathrooms. Very nice fixtures and the shower with dual shower heads was perfect. The big glass window from the bath to the room was a cool touch. This remodel had the right idea with the look and theme, but in my opinion the overall finishing was lacking some quality on the little details. I am overly critical though since I work for a different hotel company. I woke up a little late and found the continental breakfast unattended and 90% depleted. I was able to get some orange juice and cold cereal, but found it tricky to get it up to my room for both my wife and I since they had no trays to carry the breakfast on. The desk had no phone, but the toilet did??? is this a Japanese thing?",5.0,4,1.0
"Army Navy 2012
I have to give the 1 star based on housekeeping. I would have to say I give the housekeeping manager a 5 star based on his promptness and response. We came in early and Lo and behold they had a room ready. I was shocked because of it being 9 am. Well we put our stuff in the room and went out to rainy Philadelphia. Later in the day we went to eat with my mom and dad and then we went to the bar when we got back called Sole Food. They have a great chocolate martini, my wife loved it! Ok so now it is really late so we go up to the room, and crawl into bed, unfortunately not turning on the lights. 
So, the bad. We woke up and we had slept in dirty bed sheets. It appears to have been a nosebleed on the duvet and shall we say that time of month for someone for under the duvet. Needless to say we were grossed out when we woke up the next morning. It is really sad when you inspect your clothes because you are scared it might have been you and of course out clothes were fine.. Of course the gross out factor is worse when it wasn't you.
So, the good. The manager Arvel came up to the room, looked. Offered to comp the one night and asked if we wanted anything else. We actually did not. Can't really fix something like that. I would have probably comped both rooms and offered a future weekend stay or bumped our room up to a nicer room the last night. 
Super nice customer service. Navy won the game so our son got to stay overnight with us. I asked for a roll away bed and once we got back there was one in the room.
I do have to give kudos to Arvel and customer service.

"Great Stay! Can't wait to come back
I booked a ""Renew Your Soul"" staycation. Nevertheless, I was excited to look forward to an excuse to spend a Saturday night out in NYC. To top it off, the rate included a $10 mini bar credit, $10 metrocard, $10 coffee card, 1 free-in room movie, and access to the health spa and fitness center.
I arrived at the property around 11 am, and check in was a breeze. At check in, I was not asked to choose my gold amenity, nor was I given my $10 metrocard or $10 coffee card. Once I was settled in my room, I called the front desk to activate my in-room wifi as my gold amenity selection. The woman on the phone kept repeatedly telling me that it would cost me $14.95 for 24 hours, and that wifi was only offered as an amenity to platinum guests. After going back and forth a few times, she finally apologized and told me that wifi was indeed offered as a gold amenity. Iâm surprised that such a high-volume SPG hotel would be so unsure about their elite amenity choices. Either way, I told management about that little miscommunication and they made it right immediately. I commend the attentiveness manager, Miguel M.'s promptness of taking care of me - that goes to show you that excellent customer service is a priority at the hotel.
I also asked about the $10 metrocard and coffee card that was included in my rate. It turns out that they did not have any available at the moment, and then told me that theyâd have to mail them to my home address. That was a bit disappointing, but Iâm sure Iâll receive them (or at least I hope I doâ¦).
I was given a king room on the 12th floor, and the room itself was wonderful, comfortable, and spacious for NYC. The bed sure did live up to its âheavenlyâ claims. In fact, I think it has to be the single most comfortable hotel bed Iâve slept in to date! The room was quiet (no street noise what-so-ever), and the bathroom had a double-headed shower which provided amazing water pressure. Before heading out for the evening, I kicked back and watched my in-room movie (Thatâs My Boy), and I sure was glad that the in-room movie was included in the rate (my movie selection was priced at $16.95). I also enjoyed 2 cans of diet Coke ($5.50 each) to apply my $10 mini-bar credit.
As far as the fitness center/spa access, Iâm too ashamed to admit that I chose a burger and fries at Shake Shack (â¦and I even went back for custard) instead of utilizing the health center facilities, so I canât really provide a genuine ârenew your soulâ assessment in that regardsâ¦
The awesome double shower heads provided great water pressure!

"Would not recommend
I stayed in a garden suite room and was offered a lovely room with a view on a metal fence with a high wall. Basically no view at all! This is even more distressing as I did ask them by email to upgrade the room if it was available as my stay was part of a wedding anniversary. I was... totally ignored. I told the desk manager to ""fix"" it saying there is still time to do a little something for my wife: a rose - whatever but... they did nothing again. On top of this our room was not refreshed before late 5PM! nice! I wrote to the hotel manager Elizabeth Pelekis but had no response. Lovely service! 
The restaurants are overpriced but we eat well and the look is great. 
Parking at $32 is a total rip off but I was aware of it...
No wifi in the room and if you connect more than one pc to their dead slow cabled internet connection, you get... charged each time you add a device. Most hotels do a pack of 3 per connection. You get to relax in this hotel as you simply don't get wifi even by the pool it did not work!
Talking of the pool... it is messy and not cleaned - used towels were everywhere and new towels were sometimes not available at all. There were ducks who truly enjoyed the pool and were swimming in it! Nobody made an attempt at chasing the ducks away! Nice... on top there was some duck poo around the pool.
I will be forwarding pictures of myself and the ducks to the Health and safety in The US and CDC as a child could get very sick around duck poo!

We have used the Sportmen Lodge for over 20 years as it is convenient, decent and reasonable.
However, never in those 20 years have we encountered a base guitar pounding noise next door for two days both day and night. My 87 year old mother was the guest staying in the room and her first 2 days were fine. Then the pounding began. She couldn't even hear her TV. I know this is home for lots of bands but there is no excuse for this type of behavior. 
We talked to people at the desk 4 different times. We were told it was fine if he wasn't plugged into his amplifer. He was! When her grandson took her to the room after dinner, he went down to the desk to complain. The noise continued until 10:45 that night. My mom called at 10 and they told her they couldn't reach him on the phone and he wouldn't answer his door. Go figure, the guitar was so loud that he couldn't hear them! They offered her to move at that late time!
When definitely complained when checking out and they gave us a big deal discount of 10% off on our bill!

We stayed two separate nights on flights to and from LAX. I didn't take a lot of time to research hotels by the airport and just figured every HIE I've been in has been the same, so I booked it. However this hotel just seems a bit off of other HIE. 
When we landed at lax we called the hotel 3 times, and every time the phone was answered with ""hold please"". It was the third time I finally said we need the shuttle and she transferred us. Note that every hotel has continuous shuttle service. This HIE you have to call. 
The hotel did accommodate us checking in early, which we greatly appreciated. 
On our second night when we checked in we were told at the front desk the shuttle departs for the airport every 30 minutes, and they would hold it for 5 minutes if needed, but would leave after 5. While I appreciate the policy, the attitude/statement came across as a bit abrasive. 
I can't say to stay away from this hotel, I can't recommend it either. Everything just seemed a bit off without having anything really stick out as being wrong. If we fly through lax again, we will probably choose one of the other hotels by the airport.",3.0,2,1.0

Room service was great, I placed my breakfast order on the door and it came back perfect and right on time (I don't just tick boxes, I write lots of little notes and requests). 
My only one thing that was a little irritating was when I popped back to get something and asked the valet to PLEASE not take my car down, just leave it at the front as I will be back in 5 minutes. I came back down in 5 minutes and my car was gone. And then on top of that they had misplaced the key in that short time and took another 15mins to bring it back. Not cool when you in a rush and specifically asked for it to stay in front.
Overall great hotel with friendly reception staff. I would recommend it and will be back again. You cannot stay at this hotel if you don't have a car though...

The armchair was run down and dirty, like stained brown dirty, with paint streaks under one arm. The room service menu was missing the entire wine list page, and I found out later it was also outdated. When I looked in the bathroom, there were black hairs in the tub and sink. I called down to the front desk and requested a new room. The man I spoke to was very apologetic, and said he would send a bellman up immediately with a new room card. 20 minutes later, I heard staff outside. It was a bellman with someone's luggage, but he wasn't there for me. I brought my bags down to the front desk, and was immediately greeted by the same desk person who proceeded to apologize and said he ""just sent someone up"" with a card. He got another new card for me, and walked me to the new room personally. 
As we rode the elevator, he assured me that in his 2 MONTHS of employment, he had never seen anything like this happen. He explained that he had really tried to find me a room as close as possible to the original one, distance wise. I don't know why he thought that mattered. I explained that for me, the 2 important things were quiet, and a good view. We went up to the 4th floor, and walked what seemed like a mile of corridor to reach my new room. It was directly next to the ice machine. I commented on it, but the desk person laughed it off talking about how convenient it would be. As he was leaving, he asked if I'd be in the room for a while. I said yes, and he said he was going to be sending up ""something special"" for me in a little bit. 
The view was a ""courtyard view"" which apparently meant a view of gravel and other hotel room windows. The room was clean, but as I settled in, I heard the door on the other side of mine open and close, as several young children came barrelling out at full volume. they opened and closed the door several times, then went out for the afternoon. As I unpacked and settled in, I realized I was hungry but I didn't order food, since I had been told something special was going to be sent up. After an hour or so, I heard someone trying to open my door. I thought it was room service or something, but it was another child, this time from ACROSS the hall, who had mistaken my room for his. Periodically I would hear someone at my door, go to answer it, and find the same young boy being led into the correct room.
At about 6pm, I broke down and ordered soup and tea. The room service was prompt, polite, and friendly. I tipped them really well. Later in the evening, at bout maybe 9 or 10, there was a knock at the door. It was the room service with my ""something special"", 5 macaroons in berry and almond, and a little shot glass sized layered custard dessert. There was also an envelope, which contained a card with a picture of the Philadelphia Convention Center on the front. Inside was a handwritten apology from what I believe was the front desk and maybe the housekeeping staff, but it was difficult to read. The next morning when my room service breakfast arrived, I was told it was free of charge, which was a nice bonus. 
I truly appreciated the gestures, but in any other hotel, I would have been upgraded without a second thought. Instead I was practically downgraded to a lower floor in a worse location. Also, the ""King"" sized beds seemed small to me, more like a queen. I called down to ask if I had been mistakenly set up in a queen room, I was somewhat haughtily informed that the Four Seasons does not have queen beds, just double and kings. Without a tape measure, I couldn't tell for sure, but I know what a king size bed looks like, and this didn't feel wide enough to me.",3.0,2,1.0
"I would give it a miss if you can
It really is no better than OK.
The location is a bit dodgy and is not the cleanest. We stayed one night at the end of a tour and we had tried to extend our stay for the extra 3 nights we were in SF but thnakfully they were full and stayed in China town instead.
The Union Square location is slightly misleading as I can tell you it is not next to Prada and Gucci. There are a lot of crack heads about and is quite disconcerting.
The rooms were big enough but not very clean and the corridors etc could do with a good make over.
Breakfast was OK. You don't expect much in a budget place.

This is a large hotel near the convention center and shopping district. Crowded, busy elevators and parking. The carpet in my room was stained.

Parking was $60 for the night, they should be ashamed!

"Convenient location-terrible hotel
I called prior to booking my reservation. I spoke with an employee that stated the package I was booking included valet parking ($42/night otherwise). I asked if there was any way that we could get parking for cheaper (i.e. go park ourselves, street parking, etc.). The woman on the phone said not to worry because all rooms included the valet parking. With this information I booked the package. When we checked in, the desk employee said that no package includes parking and we would be charged for parking on our credit card. The package was nonrefundable since we booked in advance, otherwise we would have gone to a different hotel. The contradiction would have cost us and extra $146 had I been unable to finally convince the desk to knock the parking off. I am handicapped, so to us the convenient parking was significant. We got to our room and it was smelly, stains everywhere, and PILLS on the floor. I am glad we decided against brining our dog because he likely would have eaten them! All of the staff held out their hands for a tip-going to get the car and sending the car off was expected, but holding a door open or an elevator are just silly. I don't tip people a the mall for holding a door for me! The ice machine on our floor was broken and the room keys allow access to your floor/floors with amenities. Since we were on the same floor as the pool we were unable to ""floor hop"" to another ice machine. We called the front desk a couple of times to ask for ice for the water bottles that we brought. After waiting 30 minutes we finally just left so that we didn't waste more time from our vacation. The hotel lobby is nice and modern-everything else seems to be from the 20's. As I mentioned, there were stains all over our room and pills on the floor so room stewards were, for us, questionable at best. The thermostat on the wall is an illusion. It will not change the temperature of your room. We would have requested another room, but we were near an elevator (again, I am handicapped) so we tried to spend as little time in the room as possible.
We did not book the scenic view room, but by turning a little bit we had a nice view of the Washington Monument. The Smithsonian museums, Botanical gardens, and the monument mall was easily within walking distance. There were also taxis present at all times. The location can't be beat. Nothing is included, so we brought our own muffins for breakfast and sodas/snacks. The hotel is far overpriced for what you get.",2.0,1,1.0
"Beware!
We stayed overnight, on our way to Washington DC and that was enough! First off, there is no parking there: You can PARK in the parking lot next door, not real convenient or you could pay $20 for valet parking...ah no not for an overnight stay! Upon arrival, we were told the pool area was closed for a whole month. This is the reason for my booking the Hotel. Rooms were old but clean, unfortunately my husband woke up with 3 bites on his belly and side (hmmmm can you say BEDBUGS?) 
On the positive side the night check-in clerks were very nice, and directed use to Bar and Grill nearby within walking distance. The bellboys were courteous and helpful when we were leaving Tuesday morning. But the clerks were not friendly at all upon check out. No thank you, did you enjoy or stay or even a hello...I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",3.0,2,1.0
"So So - Expected Much Better from HI
Well, as always, I got a deal from hotwire for this hotel at 48/night as compared to the hotel rate of 100+ a night. We reached houston at around 10pm and had to wait for around 15mts to check in at the counter which was handled by one surely over worked staff. The first room that we were given (602) had a burnt smell coming up as soon as we switched on the A/C and I had to go down for a change of room which was given immediately, however, this meant having to re-pack and carry our bags again. The other room looked old and dated and finished in a hurry. The bathroom was super tiny; looked like they were literally built for kids! One of hte pillows had a massive stain - no way am forgiving the housekeeping staff for trying to keep this pillow below another one.
The A/C was out of the 90's and was badly fit and made a lot of noise - haven't they heard of central a/c?!? There was supposed to be free wifi, however, an access code was required, which was not provided during Check in. The card on the desk in the room said that I had to contact the front desk to get the code and the last thing I wanted to do was go back to frontdesk again. 
Pros
- close to HOU
- close to NASA 
- free parking
- free wifi (though I did not get a passcode)
- hotel had a laundrette (not sure if it was coin operated or gratis - never used it, but was pleased to see one)

I don't know where to start... So we had a conference to attend at the Hynes Convention Center so we needed something that was nearby and cheap.. We got there to a welcoming staff but that's as far as the positivity goes! The hotel is old and has some sort of a rotten atmosphere.. I managed to book a wrong date online (arrived one day in advance) so the management were nice enough to update the reservation and give us a room upon arrival.. we got to the room which is pleasantly large, however after endless flight hours we just wanted to crash.. I opened the bed and found remaining little hair on the bed (the linen were not changed from the previous visitors), the room had a dirty feeling to it.. so did the toilet... we were so tired on the first day that we didn't even bother, but got the staff to bring us clean bed linen for the second night.. All in all, it was not a pleasant experience and ruined a bit of the Boston experience for me.. Would I book in that hotel again? NOPE.. I'd pay a bit more and enjoy my stay!",1.0,2,-1.0

My husband, I & our twin daughters (14 yrs) flew into San Diego on a late flight a few days before my convention started.

We did not arrive until midnight on a Thursday...desk clerk was none to friendly. The room we were given was in the building closest to the road---was terribly noisy & rooms looked nothing like the photos on the internet. The carpet was torn, tub didn't drain well so you stood in water as you showered & the light above the vanity too about 30 minutes to come on. Since we were only there for two nights, it was okay for the price (internet was free, while the hotel we stayed at for my convention charged for internet--go figure!).

"Nice room
The room for some reason surprised me given it is a 3.5 star hotel. It was very comfortable. I had requested a premium city view King room. It had lots of mirrors, lots of lights, lots of electrical outlets, a very comfortable bed with nice linens, and a large bathroom (shower only). It was ideal size, layout, and perfectly furnished for a one week trip on business. 
Beware it does not have an inroom safe, so no storing a laptop or other valuables. Also, no honour bar, so bring your own snacks (there was an empty fridge to store)! And most strangely, when I called down for room service, they told me I didn't have the right menu?! That was frustrating and turned me off room service!... so somewhat disorganized in that dept.
I booked the city view because for me it wasn't worth paying for a view of the river. However, what they don't tell you, is that it's worth paying for the river for another reason....... if you have the 'city view' then you may back onto the alley where about 15 different garbage trucks roll through each night emptying dumpsters... On the 9th floor, it's extremely loud. If you don't like listening to garbage trucks at night - pay for the view!
Other than that the hotel was nice. I didn't have much interaction with the staff at all. The gym is overly adequate for a 3.5 star hotel or any hotel for that matter - a variety of equipment, mirrors, towels, and a view of the river.
I'd stay again, but I'd pay the premium for the river view....... my guess is that facing Wacker is quieter than facing the alley!",4.0,3,1.0

There is no room service and the bar is a sports bar. As I was exciting the the hotel this morning another traveler said to me ""Are you as excited as I am to get out of this hotel?"". I emphatically answered YES! Dirty, in poor condition and someplace I would never stay again. I heard through another traveler they are hiring a consultant to fix their issues.

From the outside, during the day, this looks like a nice place to stay. As you enter the hotel, front lobby area is very appealing. The front desk clerk, Brian, was extremely helpful and gave the hotel a very professional feeling. Overall, the room wasn't too bad. A few used kleenex littered the floor next to the bed, but otherwise the room was clean and functional. 
HOWEVER...once the sun goes down, you begin to see just what a BAD neighborhood this hotel is in. Hoodlum thugs littered the area like sand on a beach. Someone was getting arrested in the parking lot that night, and the flashing lights of the police car lit up my room like sunshine for over two hours. All the while, some lady was yelling at the officer and her wild toddler was running around the parking lot screaming at the top of his lungs. Coupled with the blaring police radio, I didn't get much sleep that night.",3.0,2,1.0

My husband and I drove from Houston to El Paso to visit family. We arrived at the hotel early Sunday morning, too early to check in, but we took a chance there might be a room available. Roland at the desk told us the hotel was packed and he didn't have a room available on the first floor (our preference) but he checked & found a room on the 2nd floor but without a microwave or refrigerator, and said we could have that room if we didn't mind. He offered to let us use the hotel refrigerator to store any medications we might have. We didn't have any medications and we also didn't mind not having a microwave/refrigerator or the 2nd floor room. We were able to park right by the stairs and it was not bad at all. The room was so nice and cold, the AC was on and it felt so good because even at 9:30 am, it was very hot outside. King size bed, flat screen t.v.........we were very pleased. Very clean room. Hotel is near the freeway but we had no problems at all with noise. Everything is nearby within walking distance, restaurants, grocery store (Big 8), and our family's house was 5 minutes away.

"A NY Classic
My wife and I were recently at the Pierre celebrating our anniversary. We were married in the ballroom of the Pierre. For this trip, we booked a basic suite, and were automatically upgraded to an 800 s/f executive suite overlooking the city. The hotel claims to have been through a major upgrade but to us it looked pretty much the same as it did many years ago. In some ways, this is probably appropriate. The hotel sits on the corner of 5th Ave and Central Park South abutting some of the most expensive real estate in the country. So all of the wall murals and the Persian style rugs; the elevator attendants in white gloves and the moldings and details along the ceilings... they seem appropriate for an age old classic hotel like the Pierre. So, while the hotel claims it has made updates, it still looks pretty old (and in some places a little ragged), but that was ok with us - it is a grand old NY hotel. The change of ownership to Taj hasn't affected much at all other than maybe the room service menu which features more South Asian flavored fare than in the past.
The service was excellent. Every one will have a different experience, but our's was first rate. From the doormen to the check in to the elevators and concierge, everyone smiled and was helpful. We had a breakfast included in our rate, and when we slept in and missed breakfast, they accommodated us immediately by telling us that they would add a $70 food credit so that we could order room service or have an early lunch in the hotel.
We ate in both restaurants. The tea room was great. The food in both restaurants is now provided by the owner of NY's Le Cirque, and everything was top notch from the smoked salmon dishes, to the cheese selections to the authentic pastas and sauces. 
I went for a run in Central Park, and also worked out in the gym. It is small but there was no one there and had everything I needed. There were complimentary smoothies, fruits, bottled water and newspapers.
Our bedroom had high ceilings and a separate living room overlooking northern Manhattan. The decor was a little dated, but again, probably fitting with the hotel's personality. 
The location is excellent. If you are here for museums, Central Park, Fifth or Madison Ave shopping - this location cannot be beat. 
On the negative side, there were some minor stale odors in the hallways, the carpentry, wall painting etc on the upper floors looked a little old or sloppy; but none of this was a real drawback. 
Obviously The Pierre holds some nostalgic value for me, but apart from that it is simply a classic NYC hotel, with full service in every way, excellent food and a stellar experience. And in terms of value, while our room was expensive,, all in all, it was only about $200 more per night than many other newer hotels with closets for rooms. Our room was gigantic by NY standards and I think it actually represented good value.",4.0,5,-1.0
"It could be a much better hotel if the housekeeping staff did not try to get guests up every morning
I have stayed at this hotel dozens of times, and each visit, however good, has been marred by what is clearly intentional conduct by house keeping to get us all up and out of our rooms by their schedules, not ours. I have stayed in every part of the hotel and on every floor. It never fails. That the management does not stop this is crazy. I know that the housekeepers work hard and everywhere else I stay I always leave a gratuity on the bed. At this hotel, however, I want to practically scream as the daily cacophony begins when housekeeping arrives on the floor. I stay in hotels every week, just about, but this one is unique for this bad feature. I have complained but truly, the management does nothing to change it over the years so why bother anymore? It is like the hallways were a mall or a private home where anything goes at any volume.
The rooms are fine, generally spacious and clean. The location, while certainly not downtown, has a Metro stop at the bottom of the driveway and that gets you anywhere. The meeting space is good, and older rooms are always being renovated and freshened up. If yours seems old and tired, ask to be moved. They will do it.
The restaurants are fine but even better dining is right outside on Connecticut a
Avenue and nearby streets. There is underground parking, and the neighborhood is very safe. Proximity to Zoo and Metro makes this a good place for families.
The walls are a little thin and rooms with doors between them are a bit noisier than they should be, but this average rating I have given would be much higher if only someone trained housekeeping that guests want to wake up on their own schedules, not those of the cleaning crew. It really is quite amazing and the worst on a routine (not isolated) basis of any hotel at which I stay.

"You get what you pay for
I several nights in the Mayor Hotel and will never stay again. I don't know how people gave this place 4 stars!
First off, it's located in Chinatown, which I personally am not a fan of. Nothing is in English, so something as simple as finding a store to buy a soda is difficult. I find that Chinatown is one of the dirtiest, smelliest parts of NYC. But if you don't care about that, it is a decent location in the Lower East Side. Just a short walk to some hotspots near Little Italy and a very short cab to SoHO and the Village.
But that was it for the good stuff. The standard room was 1 full size bed with about 1 foot of room around it, and a wardrobe. Which made it tight for 2 people. The bed, oh the bed was the deal breaker. It was like lying on plywood with a thin pad over it. I actually woke in pain from how hard it was. The pillows were decorative pillows that were flat with ruffled pillow cases on them, not real pillows. There is no temp control, the front desk controls the whole floor. So if you get hot or cold, too bad. It sits across from the Manhattan Bridge so it's loud, if you sleep light, bring earplugs. 
I skipped on daily breakfast because it's in the basement with the washer/dryer and next to the linen room, and looked gross.
I will say the front desk staff during the weekday's was super friendly and helpful. The weekend staff however couldn't be bothered from Skyping to help me find a place to get coffee and soda's in the morning. I stood there for at least 5 minutes and she only looked up once and never attempted to help me.

I stayed here for a week, along with my 2 friends. We arrived at 11 pm on Sunday night and was suprised the hotel is right next to the 9/11 memorial. Btw, we recived tickets to the memorial, compliments of the hotel. Our room was clean, small, but manageable. Plus I was expecting it as I read other comments about New York City. We had a small kitchinette with most of the things you need such as plates, bowls, glasses, utensils, and pots. In the hallway of every floor, there is a filtered water station with a well stocked supply of empty bottles. There is also a washer and dryer on the 12th floor, you just need your own detergent. On the common living room there is an awesome coffee/esspreso/cappuchino machine. And they have complimantary tea, sodas, fresh fruit and depending on the time of day prepackaged pasties such as special k and such. Free computer use and a nice little area to just relax. 
It is a green hotel. the shower and toilet are adjusted as such. But I can't complain about the shower pressure. They have cards that ask you to please re-use towels, but they are very helpful when you need additional towels. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room tidy every day. 
It is a must to go to either the terrace or the restaurant on the 20th floor, or both. The views are breathtaking. From the restaurant you get an amazing view of the 9/11 memorial. From the terrace, it's another great view Manhattan.
On the second day we were there it was raining pretty hard. The hotel had umbrellas for its guests, which I thought it was great. This hotel is in a great location, like I said right next to the memorial. It is close to battery park where you can get the ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island. Also Wall street is a short walking distance. Although I didn't use the subway, they were within a block or two.

I stayed for several nights through a major national meeting which was at McCormick Place. 
The location on the Magnificent Mile, the suites and the buffet breakfast, which caters for different national food preferences, were great. 
If there is a downside to the hotel, its the logistics of getting in and out.
The hotel has a relatively small street frontage and the entrance is a little clumsy with people milling around inside and outside the door. There is limited space for taxis act at the front. The lobby itself has a coffee place that sells sandwiches and drinks to go and some seating. 
The in/out issues were evident when on the first morning, I needed to get to McCormick Place early. Allowing an hour, I rounded the corner to the conference bus in front of the Westin, to find the queue extending well up Michigan.

I made reservations before reading any reviews. Really, I just booked 3 days in a haunted hotel?! I wasn't about to tell my 15 and 16 yr. old. The day we were leaving I told my youngest. He thought the hallways were creepy and reminded him of ""The Shining"". Thank god I never saw the movie. All 3 of us said we'd stay again. Location was great, staff was very helpful, beds were real comfy. I myself liked the history of it. It is old, but old with character. There's a chair in the lobby donated to the hotel from The White House. It was used by Polk, Van Buren and I believe Tyler. Beautiful chair. I can't wait for my next visit, and I highly recommend The Congress Plaza.",5.0,4,1.0
"ehhh...
its a great place to stay if you like antique things and an eclectic feel! however me and my girlfriend didn't find it romantic at all... honestly i remember her saying ""it's cool but... it's kinda creeping me out."" and the two real problems i had was the old school air condition that really didn't cool the room so we had to open a window... needless to mention it was pouring rain outside. the other real problem i had was that the only accessible power outlets were in the bathroom... so i had to leave my phone charging in the bathroom hoping that it wouldn't get knocked down into the toilet. oh and one more thing the bed wasn't comfy at all! for 100+ i would expect something more than they have to offer. we stayed 1 out of 4 night of our trip and stayed across the bay in Emeryville, even though we had to cross the bridge and pay a toll going into san fran. it was worth it and we saved quite a few bucks doing so.",2.0,3,-1.0
"Close to the fire station
Firstly I have to say that I had a bad experience with the Radisson Customer Care Department before to stay in it. According to its Web (Best Online Rate Radisson) If you find a lower publically available rate on another website within 24 hours of booking your hotel room on radisson.com, you will receive the lower rate and they will discount that rate by 25%. I found it, I submitted it fulfilling all the requirements, but Radisson Customer Care did not face up its offer and they denied giving me the discount. I exchanged several emails with them. Finally they just said that they give the issue as closed without any explanation. I repeated my claim during the checking and the receptionist ignored me, and after send the client survey, the manager contacted me without any answer and from a non reply address.
The hotel is a new nice building located between the river and the millennium Park. Therefore itâs a good option for business if you go to the loop, or for tourist, because it is at walking distance to all Chicago attractions. The hotel has a very good fitness and leisure premises, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, solarium, an athletics track, and game rooms. Rooms are spacious, but be careful, there is a fire station close to the hotel, so be ready to hear the sirens every time the fireman have to leave the fire station.",2.0,3,-1.0

I have stayed here on numerous occasions & it is a bit special. No great big chandeliers or razmatazz. It is what it is. A great location, with great staff and an atmosphere that is second to none. We usually stayed during the Christmas Season & it is an ideal location for shopping , sight seeing & the theatre. You could drop your bags & order afternoon tea in the lobby with a minimum of fuss. It was a guest friendly hotel in every sense of the word.If you are looking for large rooms with jacussiz, etc. It is not the place for you. But if you want a place that is vibrant enough with a serenity that is relaxing this is the one. Staff all seem to have genuine Photogenic memories & welcome you back as old friends. They always had a cabaret artist that would return season after season, and be in keeping with the surroundings. The nostalgic surroundings make it well worth a visit, even if just for afternoon tea. Why it's being marketed as Times Square I simply don't know. If you want the Algonquin & it's laid back ambience why would you want Times sq?",5.0,4,1.0
"Got a ""downgrade"" for standard price!
The problem began when I checked in around 5PM. I understood the woman at the front desk to say that the room reserved for me had no working TV or phone, but that I could upgrade to a nicer (model) room at no extra charge, so I agreed because I did want a TV and phone. When I looked at the room, it seemed fine. I was in a rush because I had to leave to be on time for a dinner reservation.
When I returned around 10PM, I turned on the TV and realized it didn't work. I checked the phone...dead. Apparently I misunderstood her offer. She thought I would be willing to give up the TV and phone to have a king bed instead of a queen, even though I was by myself. Then I figured out that I was offered an ""upgrade"" to a room with no amenities whatsoever. As it turned out, these are the other amenities that were missing:
1. No ice bucket
2. No cups or glasses
3. No hangers in closet to hang up my clothes
4. Drawers were already filled electrical stuff and plumbing parts
5. No kleenex
6. No waste baskets
7. Less than a half roll of toilet paper and no extras
8. No note paper, pen or printed info about the hotel or surrounding area, not even a phone number for the front desk!
9. No hairdryer
10. No phone book
At that time of night, I didn't feel like getting dressed again to go to the lobby with a list of items needing correction, so I just made the best of it.

"Nice hotel
We stayed here for 4 nights after previously staying in Downtown LA. The hotel entrance area is lovely although small. The staff on reception werent the most friendly or welcoming. They looked a bit miserable to be honest. We found everything we needed in our room, which had a lovely view of the hills. The room was comfortable, the bathroom was stylish and there were lovely bath robes. The bed was perfect and we slept very well despite there being an earthquake one night! The cleaning staff did an impeccable job.
The rooftop area is lovely - the pool is small but nice. I suppose it's a criticism but we felt like it was quite intimidating to use the pool as there are restaurant tables all around it and we felt like everyone was watching us take a dip while they ate their lunch. It's just a tiny bit too crowded and you don't feel like you can sunbathe and chill out much. 
We had bar service and ate at the rooftop restaurant in the day and evening. The bar staff in the day are fantastic and the food was incredible. The grilled cheese sandwich was amazing and I recommend the Wilshire salad.... Best salad I have ever had. The evening staff were okay - our waiter was a bit obnoxious. He was quite rude actually and it was quite obvious he only cared about trying to get a good tip. He failed to impress. The evening atmosphere wasnt really my scene. Lots of young people in tarty dresses getting drunk and being rowdy, which shocked me. I also thought the manager should have taken control but nothing was done despite the fact we had people backing up to our table and others trying to throw each other in the pool whilst we were trying to enjoy a nice evening meal. 
Location - okay but there isn't much around the hotel's immediate area, so it's a car, bus or taxi if you want to get about.

"Way better than I expected.
Stayed at this hotel for this my fourth trip to Memphis because we had a dog with us, and the other downtown hotels that allowed pets were way too pricey. Read the reviews and was a little hesitant, but have to say - was happily surprised. Clean, nice and close location to Beale Street (closer than when we used to stay at the Holiday Select!). 
I have to say it's an interesting motel layout, two separate buildings and some warehouse type building by and between it, with fencing and barbed wire. Parking lot was gated to go out to the street to get to downtown, but they open it up in the later afternoon, which makes for a shorter walk to Beale. People at the hotel were great and friendly and helpful. I see that people may mention the ""neighborhood"" but it's really fine, and is across the street for the baseball stadium there, and just a few minute walk to Beale which is what we wanted. Free parking to drive to other parts of Memphis. Pet friendly -although no great green areas for pottying the dog, but made due fine with our border collie.

Pacific Shores Inn is located in the heart of Pacific Beach. Just a 1 minute walk and you are on the sands of the Pacific.

"Earplugs and sleeping tablets required
Second and last Hyatt hotel ever. If the guys at Hyatt dare selling such a low quality service, I don't even want to take the risk and try another Hyatt resort.
We've had 6 never ending nights in a ""deluxe"" room.
And for the first time ever, we've had to use sleeping tablets and earplugs in a resort.
Make no mistake, I have been living in huge and noisy cities, travelled through noisy Manhattan, Las Vegas strip or Paris.
But never, never, ever experienced such a noisy hotel. 
So no, it is is not a 4 stars resort. Actually, It is not even a hotel :
The main thing man expects from a hotel is the ability to have a decent rest. This is what hotels have tried to achieve for centuries in the western world. This is their reason to be.
Well, there, at Hyatt, walls are so thin that you can hear you neighbors having sex. 
But wait, not only can you hear their voices. You can even hear the noise of their skins.
Insane. Family resort they say. I don't know what kind of families. 
However, make sure you'll also hear every single car, noisy chopper or motorcycle, plane, seal. Half a mile around.The power of thin walls and windows that is. 
Poor isolation is such a waste of energy. But at Hyatt, they're going green anyway : they don't clean the towels unless necessary. 
Also, they don't take 'em away either. So you can leave a dirty towel on the ground. Well. It stays on the ground!
Ecology they say. 
Furnitures are exhausted. Mattress needs to be replaced. Cheap pillows. Pool is crowded. 
Front desk agent forgot to smile during check in process (John, a smile is so unexpensive you know). 
Fitness center is roughly 500 square feet big.
Also, the guys there will charge you for about anything. You'd almost expect them to charge you for flushing the toilets. 
Do not trust them and be aware of their tricks. First day, we used the valet service ($25 a night).
Second day : nothing and parked our car in the street. 
Well, Hyatt charged us a $20 selfpark night. They never gave us the ticket that comes along with selfpark and even tho' we've complained about it, they've never removed the charge (nor gave us the ticket by the way). 
So pathethic, it was almost getting funny.
The next days we returned to the valet service. This time they immediately charged the expected $25 (mistakes only happen in a certain way at Hyatt).
One day, we've left the privacy tag on our door. When we left our room, at 10 am, we took it away. When we returned, at 2pm, we found a small paper under our door. It said : due to your request for privacy, the room hasn't been made. 
No comment. Thanks Hyatt. 
At 1pm, Einsteins bagels had almost nothing left. No salads, no bakeries.
The only good point was the Red Marlin restaurant. 
The list goes on and on. 
What a waste of vacations time ... We've had such a good time at the Scottsdale's Hyatt regency.

"stellar service, grimy room
I chose to stay at this hotel ostensibly because of the comments about friendly, helpful service and staff at this hotel -- and, to that extent, I was not disappointed. Staff members were very friendly, helpful, and pleasant. On that note, I would have given the Carlton Midway an ""excellent"" rating.
What pulls it down to ""poor,"" however, was the state of my groundfloor room. Now, I didn't have any pretensions of expecting the Hilton or Hyatt. I was anticipating, as many of the reviews pointed out, ""basic and clean."" Basic and clean is fine. 
But grimy? And dank? And dark? That's not OK.
The carpet was filthy. I like to walk around barefoot, but my feet (and the shower, as a result) were black on the soles from walking on the carpet. Was this a smoking room, I wondered? I'm usually very sensitive to the smell of tobacco smoke, and did not detect it, so I have no idea why the floor was so dirty other than insufficient cleaning (and that raises the issue of insufficient cleaning elsewhere, too ... what a gross thought).
The room was dank. It smelled damp. The AC had a distinct odor that smelt like burning dust. The lighting was insufficient: even with all the lights on in my room it was so dark in one half of the (very tiny) room that a pair of black shoes placed on the floor were invisible. 
The dispenser soap/shampoo in the bathroom were just nasty: poor quality, awful smell. I went out and bought a cake of soap to overcome this (and would recommend that those who wish to stay at this hotel do likewise). 
The noise from the outside roadway was very loud and did interfere with sleep. I was surprised at this because noise is not usually an issue for me (I generally sleep well). The fact that it was an issue on this trip either speaks to the unusually loud volume of the traffic -- and noisy people talking loudly outside my door -- or that I was just plain uncomfortable in the room to begin with.
The free breakfast was reasonable for the inclusive price. As others have pointed out, it consists of coffee (not bad, but not good), bagels, fruit spreads, and microwaveable ""Dunkin' Donut"" breakfast sandwiches -- if one can stomach the latter (I can't). 
I deliberated over marking this review as ""average""; I wanted to mark it as ""very good"" or even excellent (because of the outstanding service). But, overall, the state of the room was so disappointing and so awful that I just can't.",2.0,3,-1.0

The Allerton is a nice-sized hotel - not too big or small that has lots of historic touches and fairly modern rooms.

I cannot comment about value as I stayed on business at a vendor's corporate rate. If the rack rate is anything like the corporate rate, The Allerton would be deemed an excellant bargain. Only downside was a large, dead cockroach in the bathroom. At least it was not alive. Despite the roach, I highly recommend this hotel.",5.0,4,1.0
"Low rate hotel, know what your getting.
I stayed here for a quick night and yeh I must admit the low rate was the reason. This is a nice location south just off of I-35 which should have been a clue, My room faced the highway and the windows offer no sound barrier to the noise right outside the window. Another noise issue are the room walls, you can actually hear people talking in the other rooms.
This is pretty much a blue collar worker stay hotel. Yup, their outside drinking and smoking in the parking lot/around the lobby outside door, hanging out in the lobby. I'd say if you were a single women you may not want to stay here because of this issue.

-Keep in mind the cost.
-There are several other hotels of a higher brand just next door.
-Rooms not bad if you recall your College dorm days.
-Brings your own disinfectant spray and use it like you mean it.
-Turn the air ALL the way up its helps drown out the road noise, you'll still hear the larger trucks.
-If you can avoid the west side facing I-35 (east side) rooms, you may have better luck with the road noise. If you have them bring those ear plugs, you'll be glad you did.
-Be ready for incoming 2am partiers, that's when the bar's right down the road close, you will be able to hear their drunken stores, as the arrive.",3.0,2,1.0
"Mixed Reviews for this Hotel
We surprised our girls (ages 5, 8, 10) for Thanksgiving with a trip to NYC~ After much debate we went with Le Parker Meridien mainly because of the location & the fact that any negative response someone posted was quickly answered by Lisa in Guest Relations. Not every hotel is going to be perfect & that goes a long way in my book. 
Positives:
Close to EVERYTHING...quick (5) min walk to Central Park
quick 10 min walk to Times Square/The plaza/Rockefeller Center/Broadway, etc (we walked almost everywhere with my girls)
Guest Relations sent up Cookies the first night welcoming my girls to NYC for their first trip (big thumbs up from the girls)
Hotel was clean, not overly crowded (although it was close to sold out), staff @ front desk was friendly,etc
Kids loved cartoons in elevator
The Pool upstairs was great. The view was one of the best in the city. You have to go to the outside area & up the stairs to really take it all in. The guy @ the pool was super nice. 
Yes, its $15 per day per family, however, my kids really enjoyed it & it gave us a nice break from the hustle bustle of the day.
Negatives:
Concierge...since we were traveling during a ""holiday"" I expected a little bit more from the Concierge desk. They did not know a lot about anything except what was right around the hotel. 
This to me is the biggest draw back of the hotel. Not the most friendly group of women I have dealt with on my travels. I called weeks in advance for help with Thanksgiving dinner reservations & they seemed a little put off that I was calling. I even asked for help when we arrived & it was very apparent that a ""local"" restuarant had dropped off their menu to sell to the guests. That being said, there was brown haired curly guy, that was very helpful. He sent us to Brooklyn Diner (Diner is too informal of a word for this place) for dinner. I am pretty particular & I have to say it was wonderful. Super nice staff & excellent food. The hotel needs to step up their game with Concierge especially in a place like NYC. They did not go out of the their way to help you with anything. Very disappointing...
House Keeping....Again, not the best. The room was clean, however, the first night a bag of lotion, shampoo, etc was just dropped off on our bed...not even sure why it was there. I used one of the bathrobes & never saw it again. They do not look to see what is in the sheets before sending off to be laundered. They actually took my daughters ""blankie"" with the sheets. As you can imagine the sheer panic when my 5 year old realized it was gone. We did end up finding it (thank goodness) with the help of some very helpful front desk staff. A VERY big shout out to them! We also realized this morning that another item (my little ones panda pillow pet) was sent out with the wash as well. Too late at this point~Do not leave anything in the bed...it will be lost forever....
Side Notes:
The doorless shower drains all over the floor. The hotel really needs to look into fixing it. Nice size though...we had the JR Suite & it fit our family of (5) just perfect!
The Hamburger place was fine, not the best I have ever had but certainly good. We had a better burger @ SarahBeths down the street. 
Coffee/Bar was great. Super nice people!
Do not take ""bike taxi""~total rip off, as they do not tell you the price is per person in addition to per block.
The hotel does charge for everything. If you want to have your own items in the room you have to rent a seperate mini fridge which I found to be funny (we did not do it). The window does open a little bit in each of the rooms which was nice because we could not get the temp to regulate at night. There is not a coffee pot in the room which surprised me a little but there is a Starbucks on every corner, literally! 
The rooms are pretty quiet when the windows are closed. We brought a sound machine just in case & did not have to use it. 
Overall it was a fine stay. I would not rate it as a ""luxury stay"" but fine all the way around. Would I stay there again, yes & would I recommend it to others, yes mainly because of the location.",4.0,3,1.0

We booked the Four Points in Chelsea because it was convenient to where my brother was hosting his 50th birthday party.

There the story would end if it weren't for the major failure -- no heat in the room. The hotel was booked solid. It was late. Etc. etc. etc. They did give us a space heater -- but it was one of the coldest nights of the year in New York. The thermostat said it was 55 degrees in the room.

"Mostly fine. Kimpton, why such weird, tiny bathrooms??
I'm currently staying at the Vintage Park. I've had many stays at other Kimpton properties; in comparison, this one is fine but not distinctive. I did appreciate that my room was available when I arrived around noon (I had notified them of my early arrival when I made the reservation, but certainly wasn't counting on it). 
For the most part, my room is fine. One pro: One can open the windows, which is a rarity and something I really appreciate. 
However, there are 2 notable cons: 
1) I have appreciated that Kimpton hotels typically don't charge utterly extortionate prices for items in their mini-bars (ie, the prices might be double the retail cost of the items, rather than 4-5x the retail cost). However, mini-bar prices at this hotel are definitely on the higher end. 
2) I paid extra for a ""Corner King Deluxe"" room, which should be the nicest aside from the much more expensive suite at the hotel. Why is the bathroom so ridiculously small--so much so that it's not as functional as it ought to be? This is something I've noticed at a number of Kimpton hotels. Did I just get unlucky and get the 'premier' room with the awful bathroom? I hope not, since I'm a frequent Kimpton customer. Perhaps someone who works for the hotel will comment--should this happen again in the future, should I request a different room? Or are they all equally badly laid out? If they're all different, why do I seem to so often pull the short straw and get a less than desirable room, when I am a frequent business traveler who stays at Kimptons at least 1x/month on average?",4.0,3,1.0
"Very disappointing!
For a Hilton property we were quite disappointed. My boyfriend booked a King sized, whirlpool suite which was a handicapped room. The shower was a very small stand up stall with a chair inside. The floor and the drain for the shower stall were the same. It was gross. The room itself was old and the carpet at the edge of the bathroom was coming apart. It took about 30 minutes to get the whirlpool tub filled up...very slow water flow. 
I paid for the breakfast buffet (which is a $10 charge). The food and service was good, but I had to request for other dishes due to everything being dirty. The server said the dishwasher had been giving them problems...yuck! 
The pool and hot tub were disgusting. Large amounts of dirt, pine straw were covering the bottom of both and there was a nasty film on the top of the water. Needless to say, it was a short trip to the pool.

"W Chicago Lakeshore- 4-star FRAUD
Let me start this review by stating that I am not the target demographic that aspires to this hip hotel brand. I lucked out (or so I thought) purchasing a room for myself for a weekend in Chicago. I did not choose the W-Lakeshore, I purchased it blind through Hotwire and was enticed after learning it was a 4-star hotel and I had received an amazing deal. After staying here for the last 2 nights, I cannot recommend this hotel and in fact, have stayed at far better 2 and 3 star hotels.
My biggest gripe with the room was the connecting doors between rooms. I was awoken at 4 AM by incredibly ignorant, drunk and loud morons from the room next door. After banging on the adjoining door and asking them to keep it down, I finally called security. While I understand that being situated near unruly hotel guests is unfortunate luck, I am surprised that a 4-star hotel would have this feature in their guest rooms. The rooms design also leaves much to be desired as the bathroom sliding door and windows do not retain heat well from the shower- a definite plus for colder Chicago AMs, when you step out of the shower. Additionally, the shades covering the windows do not do a very good job of blocking out the light, so an early wake-up was my bonus for staying in such a chic botique hotel room. 
Two other things really made me feel that the W-Lakeshore was nickel and diming their customers. The first was being given a complimentary plastic water bottle on arrival into the room. I also saw two other bottles of water in the room as well, but when I read the tags on the other bottles I realized that these were $2 each. I imagine some W Marketing genius decided that this was a great way to ""increase value"" at the hotel. I call that deceptive and gouging. The other nickle-and-dime move is the hotel charging fees for WiFi use. What's the matter Starwood, the room rate isn't enough for you? I've stayed at 2 and 3-star hotels that gave me free WiFi- plus I even got a chocolate chip cookie...for free. 
So in conclusion- W-Lakeshore bad; W-group- I don't see the value in your brand, but perhaps that's the point, I'm just not cool enough to get it.",2.0,1,1.0

I would rate this hotel at the bottom of the list of all the hotels that I have stayed for the following reasons, The linen was not particularly white or new it was very worn and obviously used frequently. The decor was outdated. The room that I was assigned was on the side of the building that faced the train, which meant we heard the train passing quite frequently. More over, we were on the third floor which meant that we could hear the karaoke which is the entertainment for the bar on the first floor and that continued until 2:30 AM. This hotel is not located in an area in which outside restaurants shopping or entertainment is near. You must either use public transportation the bus, or transit system, or take a taxi. I travel frequently, and this hotel does not make the cut. However, this hotel does have a somewhat quaint cafÃ© that opens early enough to assist you in purchasing a decent cup of coffee and a pretty good breakfast sandwich. I've given this hotel to stars, however for the service persons I would lean towards adding one star. I cut my stay at this hotel one day short because of the location. There was a shooting at the public housing which is very near to this hotel. Search out other hotels not this one.",2.0,3,-1.0
"poor
we stayed there one night, the staff on reception were just about welcome.The rooms less than clean. At breafast; between the guests talking, the TV on Loud and the background music in is hard to chat as a couple. 
The Gym should be closed, nothing worked and it was a bit dirty",1.0,2,-1.0
"Comfortable & Quick
Excellent location for a one night stay for business and pleasure. Check in and out was quick and the staff were helpful and friendly. I recommend seeking a room in the higher floors as the hotel offers some decent views of Cambridge, south Boston, and Boston harbor islands.",4.0,5,-1.0
