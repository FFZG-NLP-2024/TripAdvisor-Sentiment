1,1221,"An incredible experience.  Highly recommended (if you can afford it)  Like other commentators, I am also not a vegetarian  and when I saw the menu was skeptical. Well, it was awesome food throughout the dinner. Tasty and savors, tastes never tried before. The chef uses little known and local herbs, plants and vegetables,  masterfully combined in delicious dishes.  Portion and the menu are well balance. Service excellent with the chef in the room almost all the time.  Food: Excellent 5/5 Location: Excellent 5/5. Literally in a small castle... Quiet, romantic, stunning. Few people . Service: Excellent 5/5 Price: 3-4/5 this incredible experience comes at a steep price, even for Luxembourg.",547,21/1/2024,A L,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r934863178-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html,5,en,5 (positive),5 (positive),5 (positive),5 (positive),4 (mostly positive)
2,529,"This was my first time eating at such a distinguished and awarded restaurant and I was not disappointed. Each of the 16 courses was beautiful, visually and in terms of flavor. The freshness of the herbs, leaves, fruits, and vegetables made them the star of the meal. Such great combinations and delicious flavor. The river trout was local and just seemed to make sense in this beautiful mountain setting. The carrot ice cream was a game changer and I was searching for recipes right after we left the restaurant.  I’m not a fan of game meats and did not enjoy the roebuck at all, but each and every bite of the other 15 courses was a special once in a lifetime experience.",537,21/6/2024,Mike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r956070509-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html,5,en,4 (mostly positive),5 (positive),5 (positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive)
3,1021,"This location is as special as it can get and the journey starts already on your way from the parking lot to the castle. Take the way through the garden, the view in the castle is breathtaking. The staff do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable, it’s a balance act between top class food and down to earth atmosphere in a castle that’s one of a kind. Hardly ever have I enjoyed a lunch lasting over 4:30hrs and wished for more.  Hint: if it’s warm/sunny, try having the aperitif on the terrace, even better on the tower.  The food, well it’s a piece of art and I won’t try comparing it to anything because I just do t have the words for it.

4,737,"Simply exquisite night out to celebrate an occasion, just being in Copenhagen, or the art of food.  Service is flawless and the definition of gracious without being haughty in the slightest.  The dishes are food as art, and the ingredients are the epitome and essence of themselves if that makes sense.  As fine as dining gets and distinctions in this ethereal realm between 2 and 3 star Michelin eateries are hard to discern.  The only tiny critique: the non-alcohol drink pairings were a little one-not and on the sweet-tangy side.  A couple had the main fruit juice component overwhelm the other flavors.  A bit more variation with tonics, bitters, kombuchas and the like would elevate the “flight.”",562,29/8/2021,kyle10014,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r807063539-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en,4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive)
5,545,"It's hard to pick the word that would express all my feelings that I felt during the dinner; but if I have to choose I would go with perfection. From the moment of our arrival, to aperitif (Mountain sour=TOP), dinning experience which each plate is taking you somewhere else but you are constantly in Slovenia with carefully picked ingredients. We were entertained by amazing young waiters, we went with funky pairing which was more than just amazing. During the night we got company by chef's from the kitchen and that made our stay at Hisa Franko just perfect.

6,569,"It’s very different from most other 3-star restaurants. The place truly has a soul and a meaning with its focus on fresh, organic and sustainable sea food. We enjoyed the history, the stories about the food, the educational bits, the exceptional service and most of all the food of course.   And yes, it’s really expensive for a Cadiz where you can often have an amazing dinner including a drink for 10-15 euros per person. This makes it challenging as the comparison is so completely out of balance. In London a good dinner is often 100 pounds per person and an exceptional 200 pounds which makes Aponiente great value.  To us it was well worth it but don’t set the expectations too high beforehand.",558,17/8/2019,Magicmange,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r700063517-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,5,en,4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive),4 (mostly positive)
7,696,"Big disappointment! I made reservation while I was in the U.S.,  suppose be a good treat for my dad who I didn’t see for 7 years.  But boy what a disappointment , first of all they force you to pick same price /set course menu for all people on the table, which is limited the option to try different things. They have 3 sets of menu with different prices. My dad was upset about that but I was still hope the food is good, but the disappointment continues, same material repeat on most of dishes, basically tofu, bamboo or mushrooms , tastes is not good at all,  I was really questioning how they even got 3 Michelin stars?! The service was also not to the standard, don’t waste your money there!!",542,31/7/2024,Jen C,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r962617536-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,1,en,1 (negative),1 (negative),1 (negative),1 (negative),1 (negative)

The food was creative with explosions of unexpected flavour, beautifully presented and delivered by dedicated staff who had their eye on detail and a positive guest experience.  The setting in the tent was quirky and fun and reminded you of where your food came from.  Add in the glorious fall day in Niagara, and you could not ask for anything more!

The drawback is one hour somehow complicated  drive from Zagreb and last but certainly not least , much to high price for a winery restaurant so far from Zagreb . If our bill would have been halved  ( half price ) I would enthusiastically recommend it the visit.

10,713,"Had a very slow and relaxing afternoon! Started with fresh fruit platter and traditional sweets Savoury platter was nice too with Chinese pasteries  Recommend to have an empty tummy before you come (skip lunch!), though there is only one piece for each sweet/ savoury to share between two, it is still in a very generous portion, you also get to choose and add extra bite whichever is your favourite one  Our server Carter was very professional and attended to details, you would never run out of tea and make sure everything is alright   Did I mention about the live music harp performance?

11,1237,"The food was good but the atmosphere was very stiff. When I told my son where I was going he said "" I hope your not hungry!"" One of the couses was literally one cherry cut in half covered with some cheese.  As a special effect for dessert the waiter brought dry ice in a bowl and poured Hermes Perfum over it so the table would be covered in perfumed smoke ( what the heck?) When we left with a bill of 630€ for 4, the chef who had sat down at the table next to us, did not even look up let alone said good-bye.  If they want another Michelin Star they need to step it up and polish up on their manners! Also, the toilets are not up to standard. Will NOT go back!

My only point of unpleasementless was the sommelier which was quite passive and did not help us to make the best choise.

The food has made my imagination and my attention to translate visually every taste tasted flavor, but I did not understand why being careful not to waste and to enhance what the territory offers, were combined with French wines that in my opinion did not link with the flavors of local food.

The team was amazing and attentive and there when needed, but otherwise not hovering. Everyone was friendly and it was a pleasure seeing how the kitchen staff worked on the dishes.   Except for the prawns which were a little too rich for me, all dishes were amazing -- especially the peas wrapped in fig leaves which reminded me of a Peruvian childhood dish. The smoked salmon was to die for, so was the hake. Desserts were delicious, too.   The vibe was not pretentious or stiff at all, which made the evening even more fun. Definitely worth 2 Michelin stars!

Aponem truly gives you an experience you've never had before. Every dish was a piece of art and mouth-watering. One gentle advice to the sommelier is to serve a broader variety of drinks for non-alcohol drinking guests accompanying the marvelous dishes, that would really make it complete.

The staff was very attentive, although I noticed that the executive and sous chefs seemed more focused on the tables of the celebrities dining alongside us. Perhaps next time, we can also receive a greeting from the chefs.  While I found it to be overpriced, it is definitely an experience worth having at least once in a lifetime.

17,1317,This restaurant uses fresh local ingredients. We  had a 3 course dinner with their wine. It was amazing. We went with a group and everyone was raving how wonderful it was. The chocolate dessert with strawberries had hot fudge poured over it that melted the hollow ball of chocolate. The flavor was addicting! Service  was excellent and they explained each course. They are proud of their restaurant and should be.

20,1272,Firstly we have to praise the fabulous restaurant which provided exquisite food with a small but varied menu.  It was fairly pricey - 3 courses E47 per head - but well worth it.  The staff were charming and extremely courteous.  Unfortunately we cannot be as generous about our room.  This was situated in the Pavilion and was dated and clumsy in appearance.  The bathroom had mould around the shower area which needs addressing.  There were no toiletries (only a used shampoo and sewing kit!) or bottles of complementary water which tends to be standard in many hotels if this calibre.    The Spa!  This was super and we made use of it twice being able to book it out privately for E15 per head.

Started out with some delicious amuses. The main (pigeon) was seriously the best pigeon I ever ate. The garden view was also perfect. Only minor criticism I have is that when you come there, you go to the first room to have some snacks. And there is only the option to have some champagne or other sparkling wine as a aperitif. It would be -for me- also good to order a bottle of wine and already start there.

Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.
