The rooms need an update to my opinion. But for the rest… it’s an incredible achievement to run this place for years in the the top in Europe.

2022-07-29,Rolf van der Pol,"Lovely setting, friendly staff, all dishes (close to) perfect and yet. We had perhaps in total 20 little dishes with all at least 5 ingredients prepared 3 different ways in 3 hours time (lunch). It's all just too much so there's not 1 dish that stood out, not 1 experience that we can remember.  What we will remember is the hostess in a way too tight outfit who we haven't seen smiling one time. The staff kept walking around, we liked the seating which is informal and facing the center of the courtyard (we sat next to each other which was very cozy and pleasant) , service was great, but cutlery was not always clean.  An experience definitely and we wouldn't want to have missed it (not even for 250 euro pp without drinks) but there's no 1 dish we will remember and we probably won't go back...   oh and parking an electric car in the vicinity... the car park with 400 lotz in total has only 2 for electric cars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r850739637-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html,3,en

If you are dining as a couple at the Librije you are seated next to each other but the tables are more or less in a circle so you all end up staring at each other. Food was good but not always warm by the time it gets to the table.

2020-09-27,Raymond M,"Business lunch should always be like this...  This is probably the worlds most accessible three star Michelin restaurant. Very casual, very down to earth accessible with mind-blowing dishes with lots of thought, techniques and presentation both very old school and quite new school. Skill is not used for the sake of skill but to deliver the sensation, the experience and the emotion. Most memorable are the ‘ Broodje Paling’ and the ‘ Hunnebedden’. About the former: Based on local cuisine, the chefs personal taste, old technique, some table-side cooking and a very original cocktail this is a unique amalgation of both haute cuisine , Dutch Cucina Povere and originality. A very thought provoking take on eal sandwich. For me, this is Dutch culture at it’s best: Bravo! Concerning ‘ Hunnebedden’: The young chef responsible for this dish deserves praise; this dish is a reimagination of ‘Desert’. Describing it does not do any justice to the experience. Surprise, wonder, reward comes to mind. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r772077372-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html,5,en

2019-12-29,Sander1987,"We were looking forward to eating at Librije and would give the food 5 stars, it was amazing. We especially enjoyed the fish dishes and the duck, but the best dish for me was the steak tartare from watermelon, mindblowing how much flavour watermelon can have.   The reason we only give a 3 star rating is that the service was sometimes poor service. A few things happened that did not match our expectations of a three star restaurant and the price level. First, our water was not refilled automatically and after we notified the staff that we would like a refill of our water, we saw a waiter walking around with water and refilling the water at all tables except for our table. When our next course was served the staff saw that we still hadn’t got any water and then waiter came up to our table and said that there was a miscommunication and he asked if we want sparkling or still water. They should have asked directly and not waiting so long. Secondly, my girlfriends wine was served promptly, while I had to wait a while for my beer that matched the dish to be served. Finally, there was a mix up in the tea and coffee order. I got my girlfriends order and she got mine. Again, this wouldnt have bothered us at a “regular” restaurant, but it matters at this price point.  Positive regarding the service; Sommelier served me my  favoriete beer that matched our desert and did not put on the bill. We had discussed craft beers during the evening and he had figured out that I would really like the Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait.

Some of the dishes were delicious, many were 'interesting'. They were composed of many ingredients and beautifully made up. It was made and served with much care by the big (and friendly) staff. But. It is all a question of taste, but I did not like the concept. You can hardly and mostly not recignize the food you are eating. All the courses were very tiny, in fact you get 15 amuses. Besides, you get the food on black or dark plates, and I prefer white ones. So it is very special, interesting, very good.

2019-10-29,Exroosje,"We visited the Librije on a saturday evening. We decided to go for the  8 course menu, as 10 seemed a bit too much. We asked for pairing wines, with a focus on red wines (generally you end to get more whites than reds otherwise) . During the menu we decided to extend with the cheese trolley.  The experience was nearly perfect (we only had to ask once for a refill of our water glasses) without getting pretentious.   The focus is clearly on excellent food, much less on posh appearance.    We started off with a few amuses and then Jonny Boer came with the first course (as it is made from eel and other fish from his birth ground). Then we got (a.o.) a crab salad, ceviche from lobster, a curry like dish, the famous librije egg with caviar, main was the dry aged duck and desert was fermented pineapple.   All dishes are served with a small card, describing the dish, to take home.  Interestingly we drank  a variety of reds (and a champagne from Eric Rodez) with the dishes, that still were dominant (shell) fish (sometimes paired with duck liver). But they were were a good fit, a Regent from NL (""Kiss of Therese""), South African wine made from portugese grapes (Sijnn), a Montalcino wine (Troncone), Australian Cabernet Malbec Blend. Recioto Valpollicella .  During the meal we got a tour through the kitchen and later also through the cellars.

Each dish was beautifully presented and many of the courses came with a story. The appetizers and especially the fish and duck was absolutely amazing. The desserts were nowhere near as good but still interesting and fine! Too bad the restaurant is over one hour drive from Amsterdam..

The food itself is incredible, mostly humble ingredients with complex preparations from all over the world and balanced flavours.

2019-08-15,Mikexyz,"We booked the restaurant quite a time before our visit, perhaps 6 months. We stayed in Amsterdam and caught the train to Zwolle and back. The train is a frequent service and runs very late. The restaurant is a 15 minute walk from the station. No taxis in Zwolle was our experience so plan time for the walk. Zwolle is delightful. De Librije building is fabulous and I loved the art they had crammed inside. Lounge and restaurant spaces very different but decor fabulous. Table spacing in restaurant very generous so other diners not intruding upon our space or conversation.  Service. Almost perfect. Had to ask for water but only because glasses are badly designed and staff cannot see when they are empty. A very professional team and goodness they work hard. Food. We chose the seven menu. There are a large variety of options for your degustation which made me nervous on their part as I wasn’t sure why they wanted to tempt fate by introducing the complexity of so many options. The execution was almost perfect. Just two waits that seemed oddly lengthy when it looked to me that they were synchronising diners. Overall the experience from in to out took four hours which felt 30/45 minutes too long. Food. Presentation flawless. Variety of flavours and textures excellent. Food. Seven was though courses for us. We counted 15 dishes including all the amuse bouche and others. It felt generous. Wine. We chose the cheapest bottle in the menu which was recommended on the first page of the list. I was very impressed that the menu would recommend a 45 euro bottle. And of course it was very satisfactory. Theatre. Yes there is some accompanying theatre, colour and movement. We were very impressed both jonnie and therese spoke to us ( and everyone ) as part of the experience. We loved the kitchen tour.  Go to dish? For me it was langoustine so moist and flavoursome. Eggs, trout, duck and citrus all memorable dishes also.   Value. We paid AUD 880 (for two seven courses with one bottle of wine) excluding train to Zwolle which was AUD 130 return for two. Conversion rate of Aussie to Euro is 1.64 today. It’s expensive. Nevertheless I thought the experience was fabulous. We are both very pleased we went. We recommend the experience to anyone contemplating booking. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r699246868-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html,5,en

2019-06-06,Ohh Cuisine,"Three Michelin stars, a reputation of the best restaurant in the Benelux ánd a former designation on the list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. We had been very curious for prestigious restaurant De Librije in Zwolle, The Netherlands, for a long time and now we were given the opportunity to visit De Librije with our team. Our expectations were high.   We arrived at the impressive property, which used to be a prison from the 18th century. Five members of the staff were waiting for our arrival and welcomed us in an attentive and formal way. We immediately felt very welcome. While our coats were carried away by one of them, another one took us through the narrow corridors right to the lounge area. Well, this space did not always function as the ‘lounge area’ it is today: it used to be a prisoners cell. It felt strange and exciting at the same time to be aware of the fact that prisoners – men, women, children – served their sentences right at this place where at this moment a festive glass of bubbly Champagne was poured to us before our extensive royal meal would be served. Kind of sinister, but interesting and enthralling at the same time.   In this mysterious room surrounded by lots of natural elements, we were pleased to be welcomed by co-owner and renowned sommelier Thérèse de Boer. Her formal yet cordial hospitality and genuine interest secured us of the feeling we were in for a perfectly organized experience at her restaurant. Just in case we were not looking forward to our dinner already, several bites made sure to make us salivate for more, under which there was a crisp of Mangalitza bacon and a duo of celery and gherkin with mayonaise and piccalilli. The taste of each bite was delicate and refined and the presentation of the bites was purely outstanding. You could notice lots of attention had been given to the presentation and use of colors.   Our experience continued by Thérèse leading us the way to the restaurant area. A playful, open and light space full of round tables with rough, leather tablecloths on them. The place where the prisoners could receive their daylight was turned into a unique gastronomic ambiance. A nice thing about this space is that during lunch, you can enjoy the daylight because of the glass ceiling. Big plus is that you can really admire all photogenic dishes with optimal lighting this way!   At lunch, the same dishes are served as during dinner. During our visit, the impressive sounding 10-course ‘Librije menu’ was served to us, accompanied by 6 pairing premium wines selected by wine expert Thérèse de Boer herself.   Concerning the food and wines: in this article we will not explicitly point out that each dish and each glass of wine was so well balanced and tasteful. They all were, trust us. And even though the one dish could be considered more complex than the other, all courses – from the bread with butter on the table to the friandises – were of high quality in terms of the taste of ingredients, the presentation and originality.   All 10 courses of the menu had its own classical touch.   At first, chef Jonnie de Boer introduced himself to our table. While doing so, he presented several exciting amuses together with a little card from his small and typically Dutch hometown Giethoorn. Something personal, we like that! The presentation of the amuses made it worth admiring them all for a while before we had the pleasure to finally taste them. The soft tasting amuses truly did what they had to do: making us curious for more to come.   Oyster, goat cheese and seaweed is what came to us then. An unusual combination of unique flavors put together in a superb way. For the ones with a goat cheese allergy among our team, a plate of vegetarian steak tartare of dried water melon with piccalilli was served. Besides the subtle yet full and fruity taste, the contrast created by the combination of the spicy redness of the tartare and the grey plate made it a dish to remember.   De Librije is a restaurant where offal is a frequently used ingredient. Besides a piece of brown crab in juice of toasted celery, chicken liver and heart of veal could be found on the dish served to us as a second course. Classic and intense flavors. A glass of Chenin blanc full of acids and oak flavors was served with this course, which managed to create a rich, round taste in combination with the food.   The same wine turned out the be a great match with the third course as well: a tender piece of langoustine, prepared as ceviche in a fermented Japanese tea, combined with tomatoes, kombucha and snake beans. The sour tea found its balance through the high level of acids in the wine.   The fourth course – yes, we’re not even halfway yet – consisted of saibling, pumpkin, lovage and a juice of sherry and almonds. Now, how can it be possible that we have always eaten saibling without any juice of sherry and almonds?! The taste combination was exactly how it should be. An excellent wine, a Mâcon-Charnay of 100% chardonnay from 2017 from Winehouse Jean Maciat in France, was served in gigantic crystal glasses in order to bring out the specific, nutty character of the wine.   Oriental scents were coming out of the open kitchen when the fifth course came out of it. A curry with monkfish, nasturtium, screw tree and pandan rice was shining on our plates. Delicious.   ‘Egg caviar’ was the name of our sixth course. This course is considered a real classic of De Librije. Lukewarm egg yolk with cream and a dash of 10 grams of the finest caviar on top of it – what is there not to love here?   Another classic on the menu formed the seventh course. First, Thérèse poured us a glass of Pombal do Vesuvio Douro from 2015, originating from the North of Portugal, which had been matured in wood for over 14 months. The wine went great with the natural and earthy tones coming out of the food: veal sweetbread with spicy pineapple and shrimps in peanut sauce. An interesting combination of ingredients that each had an intense taste on its own.   This dish illustrates one of the powers of chef Jonnie de Boer and De Librije: the ability to make dining an actual experience through providing surprising and tricky food combinations which can sometimes even be a bit uncomfortable. That’s when it gets fun. The art is to still let such a dish make sense at the same time and we think Jonnie de Boer is a true artist in this respect.   The eighth course consisted of ‘Ermelo’s duck’ which had been dried for two days, stuffed with hay and dandelion and then matured in parafine for ten days in order to draw the flavors as much as possible. After this process, the duck had been fried on its carcass and then cut in the form of a T-bone. Next to the duck, our plate was filled with marinated duck skin with meat offal in it, ragout of the stomach of the duck and a juice of fermented celery. Again, in our opinion this was an intense and deeply tasteful dish presented in a unique way.   A very interesting Macvin du Jura was brought to us to go with the ninth course: a traditional Macvin of chardonnay (non-fermented grape juice mixed with Marc de Jura) which aged on wood for three years and resulted in a fine dessert drink of 17,5% alcohol and sweet, earthy tones which immediately let us think of the strong, old tasting flavors of rye bread. With this wine, we received a dish of red cheese from the Bourgogne with chorizo, potato juice and tiny rabbit kidneys. Yes, cheese and rabbit kidneys.   A lovely intermezzo was created through introducing De Librije’s ice cream car at our table. We got to pick our favorite ice cream. All ice cream was homemade and inspired by summery blossom flowers.   Then the grand finale followed: a dessert made up of various citrus fruits, each in a different bowl. The first bowl was about salt. It was filled with orange and salted caramel. The second bowl had a sweet theme and had blood orange as a main ingredient. Sour was the taste of what was inside the third and last bowl: citrus with cucumber.   After our dessert, we were invited for a tour in the kitchen. It was impressive to see the hardworking staff fully focussed on preparing only the best for their guests.   Our dining experience – and it was an experience indeed – ended with a cup of fine coffee and friandises made by reputable patisserie Bontom, all nicely presented on wooden roots on a trolley.   All in all, our heigh expectations have truly been met. Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride. We don’t advise you to go here when you are someone who says ‘I rather don’t eat this or that’ in advance – but in case you are in for some surprises and oddities, De Librije is the food jail get entertained. Trust Jonnie and Thérèse de Boer to take you through the different spaces of the restaurant and be openminded for them sharing all the carefully selected fine food and beautiful wines with you. It’s truly a special experience, without any fuss, ending with a standing ovation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r679525355-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html,5,en

Every guest at dinner is given the chance to tour the kitchen, and your table is yours for the night. We walked through the gardens earlier in the day and saw a chef coming out of a poly tunnel - that's how fresh some ingredients are. And although the classic salmon and sorrel dish is not part of the menu anymore, the kitchen will happily cook it for you ahead of time. The acidity and freshness of each dish comes through in every bite, and I didn't feel overly stuffed at the end.

Their new restaurant and hotel were wonderful, offering a Michelin three-star experience (unlike some three-star restaurants that I believe deserve only one star or none). The food was delicious, from the simple asparagus to the Charolais steak. The selection of cheeses was impressive, with probably about 50 varieties available. Dessert was also good, and the service was excellent. The food's presentation is not particularly artistic, the focus here is more on taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r957875686-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,5,en

2023-07-18,schmidtmg,"Troisgros is among the iconic 3 star restaurants in France and indeed in the world. Cesar Troisgros has taken over from his father Michel in the fourth generation, and the culinary sparkle is still there. We chose to eat à la carte, and all dishes were very good to excellent to memorable. Cesar Troisgros is not afraid to offer some bold flavour combinations, such as in the (cold) starter of langoustines with vegetables (beetroot ravioli) and flowers. The aiguillette de saint pierre au shizo was superb, showing some of the Japanese inspirations of the chef (he had some training in Japan).  Only my dessert, an Ali Baba with pear au calvados, was not quite in the same league. We had a superb bottle of 2014 Meursault Coche Dury and a half bottle of 2006 Santenay. Service was superb throughout, and we had very nice chats with Michel and Cesar Troisgros.

The Maison is built in such a way as to make it seem that you are dining in the middle of nature, in the middle of the forest. From the bread to the last dish of the tasting menu I've had, everything was just delicious. The style of the cooking here is my favorite one : perfect textures and memorable sauces with acidity to be the host. Just perfect for my taste. I don't know if this big Maison is the best restaurant in the world because I've not been in every restaurant of the world but I can surely say that this is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to.

Fantastic dining experience. A great progression in the  dishes. Top quality, top service top everything. You do not get *** from Michelin by accident. The dining room and the place is close to extraordinary.   All this said, at some point you get a bill. We had chosen local wines 125 & 250 EUR / bottle. Nothing fancy. 388 EUR / p at the end ! 28 EUR  (x 10) for the welcoming cocktail ... (which was very good)  My point is we all have a psychological price we ca accept. Clearly above my standard here. We have tasted last year 2* Michelin which was nearly as good at less than 1/2 the price !    Do not get me wrong ... This is a UNIQUE experience. It is worth the trip from anywhere on the planet. But ... too expensive in my opinion and you do not get the 'value'. Purely a personal appreciation.

2019-04-23,Françoise V,"It is my first three star restaurant experience and I chose Troisgros' Le bois sans feuilles"" restaurant because they recently reinvented themselves. I was curious what a 51 years in a raw 3star restaurant could still have to discover. The place itself as well as the cuisine took some risks: probably decoration as well as culinary choices were taken at risk and this is precisely the reason why you feel like nowhere else. Don't take me wrong, I would never dear talk about ""faute de goût"". I am saying that experience here includes risk into the model. I would not share my views on the taste of the food as we are all unique and taste is personal. But I would certainly advise you to live the Troisgros experience fully, staying at the hotel being part of it. Some goodies can be purchased such as beautiful glaces, water carafes, oil lamps... at the lobby.

Gone are the beautifully appointed plates replaced with browns/tans and no visual appeal.  Gone is the creativity.  I went twice in the last year, once in the fall and once in the spring and had the lunch menu.  Except for one dish, it was literally the same meal.  Very disappointing.

2018-09-28,Pioneer64765,"I have waited several days to write this so as to be sure of my negative feelings that remain. This is the first critical  review I have given. I have read the reviews from others, many of which are excellent, but  importantly there are marked similarities with our experience and others critical comments, that for me indicates a worrying trend. Before I get into the detail it is important to remember that many guests are, like us, coming to celebrate life’s milestones and achievements. The questions for you are why do we and why is  a 3 star restaurant so often a choice.  I think it is because we expect you to create a sense of wonder, of excellence, of the weaving of beauty and surprise. We want to be charmed and amazed by your creativity and skill I didn’t experience this particularly through the food. The restaurant setting and architecture are stunning and as the outer layer they are marvelous. The next layer are the staff and their skills. There were inexperienced. One would talk to us in English and another in rapid French that we cannot follow. When we questioned a wine match we were just told why it was made and our left over wine was just removed. They leant over us to serve rather than walk around. When a fly landed in my wife’s glass and crawled out the waiter just shooed it away and left. Towards the end of the meal the staff  were saying goodbye to each other in the restaurant. This regular pattern of life is not what we come for. The food itself was simple. It could not create wonder because it was so obvious. I know what kidney and crayfish looks and tastes like with or without fruit flavors although they were so small I couldnt wonder about the flavor but about how little it must have cost. The panna cotta on the melon is still as others have said totally overpowered by the hastily cut melon slice under it. There were no wonderful dishes. The whole tasting menu came out quickly and coupled with the wine pairing per course we were drinking too fast and eating too little. We felt rushed and processed. This continued for the whole meal. I sat for a while and asked to speak to the most senior staff in charge. They asked if I wanted an autograph.... His reply was I didn’t understand what they were trying to achieve which was elegant simplicity and it wasn’t possible to please everyone. There is a fine line between elegant simplicity and plain simplicity and I think it has been crossed. I don’t need to pay these prices for simplicity. There was no beauty or wonder in the food experience for us. We felt like a profit centre. Today we went to Lameloise that restored our faith.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r620300185-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,2,en

Cab fare from the train station is about 16 -17 E .      The new location in Oches is incredible as it the decor and visual stimulus on a spring day  is worthy of mention.   It doesn't get much better that this  This place is legendary and I went with the full tasting menu with pared wines about 450E, with service included which for a place of this caliber for a 3.5 hour meal is not unreasonable..      I noted  that they do have a mini menu for children.   However  I dont recommend this place for for children  who can not grasp the experience any more than they could at Burger King.   ( I did see an american couple who brought their 7 and 8 yearold girls to dine.  The girls wore head phones and played with their phones the whole time oblivious to everything...What a sad waste) I traveled here from LA...6000 miles just for the experience as a pilgrim to a shrine. Cuisine has always interested me to the extent I took professional training to better appreciate its nuances.The tasting menu is 7 courses  + 3 amuse and +3 deserts   It was a further treat to me to be invited into the kitchen to talk with the chefs, who were both as great at their meals. Chef.Ceasar Troisgros has studied  with Thomas Keller of the French Laundry, and several of his dishes reflected some of Kellers technique.. It was a pleasure to watch the brigade from Gard to Sous working with such focus and attention to detail.    I think I enjoyed that experience as much as I did the meal.   It was food for the soul.     The wait staff, too, was warm and outgoing, and eager and would carefully explain in detail each course answering detailed questions as to ingredients.   At Troisgros, turn your self over to their  skill and passion. you will not regret it. I have dined around the world seeking out the best of the best  Troisgros is one of the finest and has held 3*** with Michelin  for 50 years !!

2024-01-17,Jean Helly,"My wife and I and our daughter celebrated our 20th Anniversary at Amber last night. I personnally had been for dinner and lunch before, but not my wife.  The ambiance: The restaurant was re-decorated a few years ago and the new decoration looks much better than before. Newer style, very clean, the tables are very spacious. The restaurant was only half full last night so it was also very quiet. Everything on the table was clean and tidy, as it should be with a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  The staff: The staff is well trained, very amicable and willing to chat just the right amount. The dishes were explained very clearly and my wife (who is an excellent cook herself) was able to ask questions. Getting the attention of the staff was no issue.  Visit of the kitchen: With our Full Amber Experience came a visit of the kitchen. A nice touch that we appreciated, which I don't think too many restaurants in HK offer. Our Spanish Mackerel dish was prepared before our eyes by the chef with full explanation. We then had our dish in the kitchen while the chef was explaining to us how the whole kitchen is working. A totally cool experience.  The wine list: The wine list is extensive and comparable to Restaurant Petrus for example, and more extensive than Gaddis. The markups are a little on the high side compared to other fine dining restaurants in HK. I had chosen my wine in advance and went with a 2012 Malhadinha (a red Portuguese wine) that lived up to my expextations entirely. The glasses used by the sommelier were the correct ones.  The food: The menu is an absolute masterpiece. Each dish is extremely well crafted, the ingredients used of the highest quality. The flavours are very complex and goes along very well with the presentation of the dishes. 2 things to note: - the menus are entirely sustainably sourced and Amber gets a Green Star from Michelin for this. - there is a vegetarian menu option, which my daughter ordered, and the portions are meaningfully more copious than the non-vegetarian menu, similar to my previous experience at Amber. Not an issue of course, but worth noting.  Our Anniversary dinner was a complete success, and we'll definitely come back to Amber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r934542017-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en
2024-01-09,tobeslo,"My wife and I revisited Amber for a birthday lunch celebration after many years - the last time was some years back before its renovation.  We liked the softer ambiance and the natural light filled space.  The dishes were meticulously put together with taste profiles as precisely executed as we could remember. We chose the “Extended Amber Experience” with four courses and it was sumptuous and satisfying.  We were delighted by the prawn consommé which was flavoursome, the tooth fish and scallop with was tender with freshness, the duck that was so gamey, while the signature Red Sea Urchin “cauliflower” lobster caviar was as memorable as our last visit.  The petit four combo was one of the most impressive with fruits, and freshly made Ying Yang (coffee and tea) mix.  Staff were professional and attentive, who explained each dish clearly; and the wine list comprehensive and advice was spot on - the range of wine-by-the-glass is large.  We enjoyed the experience from start to finish, with each element working nicely together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r932985561-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en

My friend and I booked a table for 2 in Amber for a special Four Hands Dinner of Amber x Syrco BASE in 13 Courses menu. I really enjoyed the new concept of Amber restaurant after the renovation.  (Amber's progressive menu showcases pure flavours, masterful techniques and chef Richard Ekkebus's creative vision. Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt. Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)  Needless to say the guest chef Syrco created an amazing & interesting menu with the combination of Dutch & Indonesian flavours. My favourite dishes are the Pigeon Kobocha Foie Gras from Amber and the Grouper Turmeric Cabbage from Syrco BASE. Looking forward to the new restaurant Syrco BASE opening in Bali in Q4 2023.

The highlights of our menu degustation is the bread (mind blowing!!) and the fish soup (one of the signature dishes of the restaurant); we loved the fact that all products in the menu are produced in private farm of The Margi hotel; huge turn to sustainability!!

2017-07-22,Liana P,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with my mother and her friend and we were so thrilled with our experience. We had their Greek (left side) 6-course tasting menu with the Greek wine pairings - the meal started with an aperitif of 4 different small delicious treats and then a sundried strawberry and hazelnut amuse-bouche paired with a sparkling rose wine, moved onto a sea urchin dish, a choice of scallops or lobster (I had the lobster, which was served with the best mango/mint/other things I can't remember salad I've ever tasted), a cod dish (my favorite) which they served with their aged sourdough and homemade olive oil (definitely going home with a few bottles, you can't buy them online!!), an amazing lamb sous vide, a selection of Greek cheeses, and ending with a millefeuille and cherry sorbet. The dishes were consistently delicious, the presentation was beautiful, the wine pairings were 100% on point, and our server Zacharias was attentive and informative and made us feel comfortable and at home.  For anyone living in or visiting this area, I cannot sing my praises loudly enough for this restaurant. The ONLY critique I can offer is that the Margi does not promote this restaurant enough. Also, the restaurant is only open during the summer and only on weekdays, but it is still quite new (2 years old I believe) and my hope is that they will gain more well-deserved popularity and attract a broader clientele which may allow them to stay open during peak weekend hours. Their style of dining is not for everyone, but for the price and quality this should be a destination for couples and groups of adults looking for an exciting, sophisticated night out and a meal that is more art than food. I recently ate at L'Espadon at the Ritz in Paris (2 Michelin stars) and La Tour d'Argent (1 Michelin star) and while I am no food critic, the meal I had last night at Patio was a very close rival, if not better in some respects, and CERTAINLY better in terms of the price.  12/10 would dine here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r504375416-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,5,en

We may give a praise to Zaharias who took care of our entire meal (3 hours duration) with such a professional and stylish way.  Patio restaurant consists of 9 tables in total and it is the ideal place for a unique, semiprivate and romantic dinner. We would definitely come back.  P.S.

2022-11-05,Duckjibe68,"After two pandemic years and two birthdays spent alone, I was looking for something special, this year. How did I find Magdalena? By searching the Michelin website for something innovative in the Swiss territory. Being Italian, pasta or meat or fish are always present in any kind of meal, so an innovative vegetarian experience geared toward new Swiss culinary creativity clearly appealed to me. After carefully reading the comprehensive and exhaustive menu, we decided on a seven-course menu with alcohol-free beverage pairings. To open the dancing, only alcoholic part of our dinner, was a wonderful sparkling wine from biodynamic producer Kluss 177. This is the only part that I can clearly describe, being the amuse bouche, all seven courses, the pre-dessert, and the ""petit patisserie"" so articulated that it would probably require too many words and knowledge that I certainly do not have. What to say, then? Well, the experience started already with a very high level of taste, maintained consistently until the end. Every single course was a perfect balanced mix of ingredients and taste, leaving a mixed feeling of relaxation and amazement, wondering if the next step would be able to surpass the previous one. And this happened, every time. Special mention for the cauliflower, which left me totally amazed (I have never been able to enjoy a single piece of cauliflower with pleasure in my entire life), the pre-dessert and the incredible dessert. The most difficult dish? The ""cheese"", at the time totally unexpected and therefore misunderstood, but coming back to my mind, now perfectly placed in the full picture of this culinary journey. Very interesting pairing with the soft drinks. I would have liked some tea, but it would not have been too local. Location? Cozy and casual with a really nice view (not from our table, but we had the couch). Crew? Young, friendly, knowledgeable and always with the right pace. Espresso coffee at the end of dinner? They challenged a real Italian, coffee lover...and they were right. Excellent espresso. Bill? Aligned with the dining experience. What else can I say?

2024-06-02,Avner V,"The Terra - The Magic Place, is indeed magical. If you are looking for the perfect escape/indulgence, this is the place. First, you drive on a small road that climbs through the amazing alpine landscape; when you reach to Terra, you are at the top of the mountain. The place only contains a small number of rooms, which means you have all the privacy you want to look out at the outstanding mountain view of the Dolomites and stars at night. Then, of course, is dinner in the two stars Michelin restaurant – for three hours you will have one of the most unforgettable meals. The local wine selections that accompany the dishes are incredible.

The combination of the secluded location, the restaurant, the wine, and the breathtaking panorama view of the Dolomites is memorable. We look forward to coming back!

The wellness area is small but beautiful and welcoming, adequate for the number of guests. But let's get to the top... dinner. A long and delicious tasting menu, where every single dish deserved the attention of multiple senses... from sight... to aromas... to taste. All accompanied by an excellent wine tasting proposed by Mrs. Gisela. Our first experience in a ** star hotel and we were able to understand and appreciate the research, the study, the work that brings incredible dishes to the table! Much attention also for my celiac wife. The gourmet breakfast is also excellent with dishes and ingredients of the highest quality.

We all had the degustation menu and the execution was outstanding in all respects: exquisite presentation, perfect execution. Excellent service. We had a total of 6 courses with many ""amuse bouches"" in between; We never waited more than a few minutes before being presented with a dish or some preparation meant to intrigue us.

2022-05-31,Jeffrey R,"When any French Michelin 3 star restaurant chef/owner tells me that he appreciates my comments about a fairly priced wine list and not gouging his customers with only a list of expensive bottles, as so many of his peers do,  I know I am going to love his place. And we did. What a meal. Reserving for the few spots six months in advance so worth it. From the glorious surroundings of the dining room itself to the exquisite menu and all the extra little dishes that show up along the way. Mushroom foods and things everywhere. Everything is so creative and delicious. Each course a delight. The service so superb—even beyond expectations. The wines we chose by the glass and bottle so reasonably priced. One of the major complaints I have had over the years in France is dining at these 2 and 3 and stars and leaving feeling abused by the wine prices. Regis and Jacques disagree with their expansive and fair list list but many under 100 euros for the bottle, and reasonable by the glass, too. A tour of the kitchen conducted by Jacques himself and the fromage room just splendid. The breakfast looking out into the countryside  equally a delight. The hotel itself built into the side of the Auvergne hill is so interesting and rooms so comfortable. Perfect. Well worth the cost.

2021-08-12,BibouHunter,"Nested in the middle of nowhere, there is little chance that you come to the village by chance. Like Vonnas and Georges Blanc, the village lives thanks to the Marcon. At the entrance, there is a nice bar, and you can buy souvenir or food in one of the shops. And the village keeps its true character. If you do not have the chance to have a room in the main hotel, no problem. We stayed in the Clos des Cimes and everything was nice. The restaurant is some hundreds meter from the hotel but there is a limousine service that takes you to the restaurant and back. So, you can let your own car in the dedicated parking for the night.   The dining room is very elegant, and the view is just great. We were there for dinner but visited the dining room at daylight and the landscape is so beautiful and very changing (we had bright day coming and fog and storm the next morning when departing).  I suggest, as meals are prepared according to the seasons to follow the Maitre d’Hotel’ suggestions, do not worry, all is just excellent, fine, well-prepared and good-looking. Staff is great, kind and very professional. The sommelier we had was very helpful and made us discovered some unknown designation.

It may be my own taste that has changed over the years, but the menu does mention that they are making an effort to serve light, healthy food...

It is not just the great food, lovingly prepared and to an extent based on local traditional recipes and produce, but the whole ambience.  Great food, great service, great wines, but without the pretentiousness of many one star or two stars in France, let alone three stars. Everyone can feel comfortable here.  The service here is immaculate, attentive and efficient, without being overbearing.  The dining room is wonderfully managed and the sommelier, so well informed and helpful.

The wines were delicious and matched perfectly but we would have enjoyed more description, albeit we appreciate our language differences may have been the reason for this.

I wondered how someone who didn’t like mushrooms would fare but we were reassured that they would happily cope with this or any other dietary requirement.

2018-06-22,Ontheroadagainsoon,"One definition of a Michelin 3 restaurant is it is a destination. This one truly was for us. We were traveling Southern France and Switzerland and based on a friend's good raves, we sidestepped by a 3 hour drive and 24 hours of our itinerary to experience Regis & Jacques Marcon's restaurant and lodging. It is definitely a highlight of our entire trip and will be an everlasting special memory. To begin with the hotel was amazing. The pictures did not impress me so I was expecting to be underwhelmed. Instead I encountered minimalism but in the design hands of architectural genius. Even the parking garage was amazing! The meal also went beyond expectations. The food was creative and balanced and delicious, the service was attentive, and after 4 hours of eating what had to be 17 or more courses we were pleased to only have a few steps to walk to our room!  I am devoting another paragraph to give some help in getting reservations. The diners are mostly French and the staff is all French although most had a decent comfort with speaking English. However, I found the securing of reservations very confusing. Their website is only in French and all of their email communications were only in French. There is a restraint on advanced reservations. When I was finally allowed to make our reservations I could not find a way on the website to reserve a single night at the main lodging. I therefore sent an email and was promptly given confirmation of our lodging for 1 night and our dinner. (There is an alternative lodging but if you are going the distance go the whole way!) With the confirmation email which, again was in French, we had a very detailed instruction on how to secure the reservation. It involved going to our local bank and they had to transfer the money to the French bank. We have never had to make such a transfer for a reservation before and having it all instructed in French was difficult for us as well as for our banker! The good news is that we had an amazing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r589776904-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html,5,en

It's the sort of meal that stays with you for the next day in the memory of the tastes and textures. The only disappointment was that during the evening of our visit there was a lengthy power cut (2-3 hours). The staff ensured a fantastic atmosphere by candlelight and it's quite incredible that they managed to continue to cook and present such amazing food working by candlelight and cooking on gas in the kitchen. All the same, it meant some delays, which led to us waiting long periods in between the early courses, and being rushed through the final courses. In the end the meal we started at 8:30pm didn't finish until 1am. I credit the staff for continuing, and it didn't affect the quality of the food, but had we known in advance (the power cut was before we arrived) then I think we would have postponed, because we were so tired towards the end of the meal that we appreciated it less than we might have done.

2015-11-13,fanoffrance,"One of the specialties of this fine restaurant is the local mushrooms, which of course are available in abundant variety in October.  I was served a little frying pan containing an assortment of delectable mushrooms, and the chefs also used them to good advantage in the recipes.  I've dined here 4-5 times over the years and have always been satisfied.  The standout dish for me this time was the perfectly cooked rouget--one of the two best fish dishes I have ever eaten--with its tender, juicy flesh and crispy skin, accompanied by delicious sauces and vegetables.  The cooking style in general is light and airy, without much fat; still, I ended up feeling stuffed after a ""small"" menu, and the couple at the table next to me had to ask their waiter to omit a considerable portion of the (larger) menu they had ordered, because they were already full!

He was right. I could enjoy from starter to dessert with greatest satisfaction. When the starter was served, I was really surprised, not was impressed. In my impression, it will show picking nice food from the forest. Following it, all did not betray may expectation. During the course, we are offered kichen tour. It was very impressive as well. He, Chef Regis, has absolute confidence for his policy.  Dinner ended up around 23:00. Next morning, when I had morning walk around our hotel, big SUV stopped in front of Bistro and a guy got out. He was Regis and after I said hellow to him, he went into the Bistro kitchen.

2015-04-23,StephaneTreppoz,"We went there for dinner and one night at the Relais & Châteaux hotel. We took the discovery menu which comprises of six courses (properly sized so that you enjoy each and every one) + cheese + dessert not including mignardises and a couple of other surprises. The meal was outstanding be it for fish, meat and of course vegetables (asparagus, forgotten vegetables...) / mushrooms (morels) which are a local specialty. The waiter offered a visit of the kitchen where the chef and the entire squad work with razor sharp efficiency and smile  The dining area oversees the mountain and it is beautiful and peaceful to look at. The architecture of the building is a mixture of modern style and more local treats. You are in the middle of nowhere in the mountain (1.200 m high) with fog pretty often which gives a rather surealistic touch to the experience that my wife, my father and I loved. As we said during dinner, this is in restaurants like this that you experience what ""the Genius of French cuisine"" is. Even though this is an expensive meal (you are in a 3-star Michelin restaurant), you pay a fraction of the price that you would pay in Paris for the same experience. You can run there for a 24-hour romantic getaway eyes closed!

Everything from the views (both in the room and the dinning-room) to the overall feel of quality in the place is remarkable. Food is breathtaking, the tasting menu, recommended by the restaurant manager, is worth every penny. The service is flawless and the dishes (about a dozen) come and go at a very steady stomac friendly pace, We spent 4 hours dinning and it did not feel that long at all, the theme is clearly ""mushroom everything"" and the chef is truly a master when it comes to cooking them and making them part of the experience (you even get mushroom shaped sugars with your coffee!). Pricing is high as you'r dinning in a 3 michelin stars restaurant but compared to a similar place in a big capital city it isn't bad at all.We only found one thing a bit odd, none of the silverware was polished, it was very strange for this kind of establishment but maybe there is a eco concept behind it (the entire hotel complex is built with green sustainable enery in mind)?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r265394119-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html,5,en

Crippa is managing to elevate simple ingredients to an explosion of flavors. My favorite dish? The Borscht soup, amazing!

There was a choice of an optional dish (at an extra cost of from Euro20-00 to Euro40-00) from four dishes and you could also do wine pairing for Euro90-00 each.  This restaurant is on the first floor of a building that overlooks the Piazza Duomo and has its entrance off a small side street. the Vicolo dell'Arco. The interior is modern and chic with pink walls.   Our four course luncheon degustation started out with nine amuse bouche/starters There followed our additional option dish called Salad 21..31..41..51 (Euro40-00 each) that amazingly had over 80 different salad ingredients. After a short break we started the main menu with Codfish, almond and lavender, zucchini and clams, followed by Rooibos risotto, Duck breast Marrakech and for dessert, Yoghurt and honey. Interesting coffee and tea menu (Coffees Euro10-00 each). Coffee came with 6 different petit fours each. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish, the range of which really set tested the taste buds. Some dishes better than others but not a miss amongst them.  Wine list was a tome. Our bottle of 2018 Barolo from E Pira & Figli was Euro150-00 and excellent.  Service was exceptional. Staff were attentive and explained all of the dishes well.  As we left we met the genius behind it all, Enrico Crippi.  This is fine dining at its best though it is not cheap.

The tasting menu has 8 courses, plus an amuse Bouche and bonus dessert. Portion sizes are appropriate for the number of courses, so that one can enjoy all of the items without feeling overwhelmed.

2021-11-18,Yukari K,"Piazza Duomo marked the end of two solid days of eating white truffles throughout the area - this is our fourth trip to Alba. We were at Piazza Duomo with a friend and of course we ordered the truffle menu. The first thing we were astonished by was to learn that the 270 euro price did not include the price of any truffles, which were charged by each gram we used. The price of the truffles was 13 euros a gram, more than 2x the street price (the price charged at well-reputed trattorias), which seemed egregious. Our Italian friend who eats in Alba every year was shocked by this system.   Needless to say, their ""generosity"" shaving truffles on our dishes seemed more extractive than generous (whereas we left a meal the previous night with the exact opposite impression of a restaurant that included the truffle cost in the price of the menu)  Most of the dishes were very good, and the chef's reputation is well deserved. There was only one dish that missed the mark. Like so many other chefs, this chef also tried to pair truffles with chicken, perhaps to marry the simple with the sublime? Either way, it rarely works, and his dish didn't either. He actually had a delicious marsala sauce on it that married well with the flavor of the truffles. We all scraped the sauce off the chicken and ate that with the truffles. We ate the chicken separately.  The chef is reputed to be known in Italy for his experience in Japan, and he is known to marry the east with the west in his cooking. As a Japanese national who is intimately familiar with Japanese cuisine, I must say that I saw little trace of that influence. His weakness in fact appears to be vegetables, even though that is a big element in Japanese cuisine (to be fair we did not have the salad he's supposedly famous for). There was one savory custard dish that was stunning that could possibly have  been influenced by the Japanese chawanmushi though it also could have been a variation of the sformato.   The biggest issue here is the service. We found the wait staff to be pushy, impersonal and lacking in knowledge. The descriptions of the dishes were perfunctory at best, a recitation of the ingredients. Chefs that produce dishes of this caliber usually like to share the story about the source of the ingredients or the intentions behind the dish, but the descriptions were little more than a recitation of the ingredients. We also would've expected the servers to be a little more excited and engaged in the dishes, but you almost got a sense of boredom from them. Incidentally, when my husband went to the restroom, he saw three of the servers chatting amongst themselves with no attention on the guests.   At the end of the dinner, the server presented us with a menu for eight different coffees. When we asked for the difference between them, they were unable to tell us more than how one had the flavor of chocolate or another had a little more acidity than the others. Or that all of them were 100% arabica beans. If you are charging 15 euros for high-end espresso, they should have a little more information than that.   If you come here, you will for sure have a wonderful meal, but for us once was enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194664-d1492721-r819207124-Piazza_Duomo-Alba_Province_of_Cuneo_Piedmont.html,3,en

There was several wow moments with the food, but it got a little laboured near in the end.   Perhaps there is too many dishes and too much richness?    For me, I felt that the service dissapointed.

2024-05-21,Anna M,"We travelled to Girona specifically to visit this restaurant.  We were so excited to get a reservation and built our trip around this visit.  We wanted to visit after seeing the Chef's Table episode on Netflix and were expecting something very special.  We have been to many Michelin restaurants with a few 3 star under our belts.  This experience was very average and does not align with what one would expect for a 3 star rating.  It was awkward from the moment we entered where there was no one at the front to greet us and we stood around looking for someone to help us out.  We thought maybe we came through the wrong door!!  Not a single question was asked of why we were there (Anniversary, Birthday, etc.) , where we were from, etc..  The restaurant itself is very nice - very comfortable setting with a beautiful natural landscape in the center and nicely spaced tables.  After sitting we waited a while again for the menu and water service, which in Europe I am OK with, but for a place like this it is not acceptable.  These are little things, but definitely not what is expected for a restaurant at this level.  We were at Disfrutar a few nights earlier and the service was exceptional and they made a real effort to appreciate that you were at their establishment.    As far as the menu goes we opted for the short menu - our mistake - if you do go be sure to get the longer experience because the timing isn't much longer and some key dishes are missing from the short menu - especially the desserts.  The food was good but nothing was exceptional.  Execution and quality of the ingredients is what you would expect, but nothing was good enough to talk to your friends about.  In fact, the main meat dish, which was a take on a beef Wellington, but used poultry elements was just not good and not incredibly original.  The ratio of the dough to the filling was off so there was more crust than needed and not a very tasty execution of the proteins.    The biggest letdown was the desserts, the primary reason we came, which were very average.  The first dish was an ensemble made from sheep's milk - this was pretty good and had a cone that had the scent of a sheep which made it kind of fun.  The next dish was confusing.  It was supposed to be a take on the memories from reading books, I think, where the aroma is supposed to based on the smell of old books.  We were given a splash of oil on the hands that was supposed to be this scent, which you licked before embarking on eating the dish.  The dish was not interesting and did not provide any sort of continuity both in flavor or texture and did not seem to align with the theme that was explained to us.  The dish also did not go well with the first dessert because both desserts were pretty heavy milk based recipes.  Finally - in fear of sounding pretentious, when I went to go to the restrooms I was super confused on where they were so I walked back and forth across the mirrored walls looking for the door, which ended my night in a similar way that it started - awkward...  Most Michelin restaurants walk you to the restrooms and ensure that you know your way around.  Our opinion is that El Celler de Can Roca is at a Michelin level but definitely not worth a special trip nor did the service or food stand out as anything special.  We have had more creative dishes both in presentation and flavor at many other restaurants and service was not on par with the other 2 and 3 star restaurants we have visited.  Even many of the one star restaurants had a more immersive and welcoming experience than El Celler de Can Roca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r951771154-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,3,en
2024-05-04,Greg T,"We've tried for two years to get a booking as we've lost out to the bots, so we had high hopes for our one-year wedding anniversary dinner after staying up until midnight to get this booking (we got married near Girona, so this place had a lot of meaning.) We also chose to have our wedding dessert from rocambolesc last year so this restaurant meant so much to us. We actually told the staff this, and they didn't care at all!!!!. The last 3 Michelin-starred restaurant we ate at was HÉLÈNE DARROZE last month, and wow, did they bring out all the stops!!! (they made a special newspaper for us and as soon as we entered they told us how grateful they were to choose them to celebrate our lunch with them. From the moment we entered their restaurant, we were made to feel so special. At el celler de can rocca, however,  no one was made to feel special that we could see, especially us! . We chose to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary here, and we truly regret this decision. We had even said before we would bring our wedding party back here for our ten years - sadly, we wouldn't even come back for petit fours.   When you choose to save and spend your hard-earned money at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant, which is at least £1000 for a couple, you would hope that you at least get greeted well. They couldn't even find out booking initially!   The food, in all honesty, was pretty boring, void of fun and personality, and everything had a foam or emulsion that tasted the same.  I've never felt the need to say something in a place like this, but I was so frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. When I excused myself and asked to speak to someone, I was met with excuses of how they were going to bring out a dessert for us. However, it was a little too late. The effort should have been made from the moment we arrived. I appreciated the apology, but it wasn't really heart felt.   This restaurant has no business holding three Michelin stars! That extra star is reserved for the wonderful restaurants that go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and appreciated.   I had hoped something special would happen at the end the meal to make up for the truly poor experience but it did not manifest.   take your money elsewhere to restaurants that do not rely on reputation.    A real, real, really wasted evening!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r949511572-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en

2023-08-08,melandashfoodies,"Sorry for my belated review, I am playing catch up. Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.  It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.  The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me,  having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more  theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine!   The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.  A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r908812594-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2023-08-02,James T,"This is everything you'd expect from a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars.  The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre.  The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.  We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience.""  We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours.  A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink.  The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.  Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.  I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.  The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.  Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything.  It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc).  The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.  The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.  A truly memorable experience highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r907384675-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en

It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment.

2023-07-06,Joanne P,"We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines).  There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch.   Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post'  - put in my bag for later disposal).  There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac,  the langostine and the caramelised apricot.  Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r900948718-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en

2023-06-14,Oscar,"Service/Decor: The restaurant is beautiful—modern, clean, and simply decorated without being sterile, the decor and natural lighting makes the place warm and inviting. The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.  Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.  Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.

2024-02-29,Tom-Erik Falla,"This place has been on our wish list for a while and finally we found the opportunity (on a Wednesday in the middle of the week!) and it really was a party night. The venue is very pleasant, few tables, high ceilings and absolutely no intrusive music. We sat right next to the small kitchen where the ""magic arts"" were performed; very fun to ""follow along"". The dishes (just under 15, with small and large) were served at a relaxed pace, by waiters (and chefs) who knew what was being served. No for granted everywhere, that!  The wine pairing was thoughtfully put together; 6 out of 7 wines I had never heard of, but all tasted excellent. I would like to object that the wine menu was in the most expensive tier (and the pour somewhat modest), but never mind, never mind - don't detract from that, certainly sensible! The dinner party had non-alcoholic pairings; here certain variants were more ""interesting"", so to speak. But these were also skillfully presented.  There were beautiful glasses throughout, as well as serving plates, chips etc. - lots of fun. And the food was consistently comparable to some of the best we have been served!

And also delivering the food explanations.   So what was odd.  Minor points but there were misses such as a sticky table, wine going missing and messy aprons on servers.   So this felt like an excellent meal delivered in a friendly place and therefore not quite perfection.

2024-09-25,princess and pea,"After seeing its third Michelin star awarded we made a special journey from London for dinner at L’Enclume. We have never been so disappointed by a three star restaurant.  The first five appetisers were delicious, promising a wonderful meal.  From then on it went rapidly downhill, every dish being either much too salty or dominated by an aggressive pickled vegetable flavour. By the end of the meat course I had an unpleasant taste in my mouth I could not shake off.   Such a shame.  The service was outstanding, the project management left us in awe and the cooking was incredibly precise, well up to the standards we have seen at Moor Hall, the Ledbury and Core. Whoever had the idea to ruin all this with clumsy seasoning and inappropriate sequencing of similar-tasting dishes scarcely deserves a single Michelin star.

Our taxi dropped us off outside a random building and we were a little confused, except for the very small sign on the wall fairly low down the entrance is nearly invisible. As soon as you walk in you are met by one of the many truly wonderful, friendly warm staff members who immediately do everything they can to make your visit special. This isn’t a stuffy over priced restaurant, it’s a wonderful experience of amazing food, fantastic wines and engaging staff. I honestly can’t compliment the staff enough. They were all extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, wines, produce and history of the building.  I now get to say I’ve  licked my plate in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, in front of one of the staff and I was absolutely egged on by them (it isn’t something I’ve ever done in any restaurant let alone my own home but it was hilarious).    There were so maybe fabulous courses to try that picking just one favourite is too hard and I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who likes to be surprised. I will however say that they need to register the word crumplings (a crumpet dumpling hybrid) and they were delicious.

2024-07-09,John G,"Our “Break in the Lakes” has been fortunate enough to allow us to experience this Restaurant - one of only nine in the UK to have 3 Michelin Stars.   We didn’t expect to be able to get a reservation at such short notice but we were pleasantly surprised when we did - only a few days before.   L’Enclume (French for “The Anvil”) has the feel of a top class establishment when you arrive, with a discreet entrance and a minimalistic layout.   Throughout the evening you can experience a cast delivering top quality service and food to match. Unlike the Fat Duck this is all about the dishes and the locally sourced ingredients, if you an “experience” then head a few hundred miles south to Bray - this cannot be compared to that.   Nevertheless this meets the objective of a unique and memorable meal - and the wine flight to accompany each course is recommended, the Sommelier will ensure you leave educated and tipsy!   So, why a 4/5 rating? For the price of the evening it didn’t quite meet expectations. Perhaps the Michelin Star “Rogan & Co” option that Simon has literally just down the road in Cartmel may have been a better fit for us (and our budget).

2023-07-16,jbrown2665," This is now the second time we have been to Delta and both experiences have been outstanding.    Last summer, we visited the restaurant shortly after they first opened and before their Michelin two-star rating, but even then, you could easily understand that they were destined for greatness.    When we went back last week, it was nice to see that the staff remembered us from almost exactly a year ago.  While there was one similar dish from the year before, every new addition to their repertoire was surprising, flawlessly presented and perfectly executed.  Another reviewer said it perfectly that “this is not only a restaurant; it’s a full experience” and it is an experience that should not be missed if you can manage it.   Well done, “Delta”.

The commitment to sustainability is beyond admirable, and the presentation of each course is truly phenomenal and without equal.  At the end of the evening, however, I felt that maybe the taste of the food was at times secondary to its appearance.  I am not trying to be overly critical, as most of the courses were excellent, but the ""early spring insect of lobster"" in the form of a bumblebee and the ""edible butterfly"" of chilled aerated beeswax cream and other ingredients are examples of too much focus on presentation and not enough on taste.  Neither dish was particularly great, while the pluma iberico course, which was plated in a straightforward manner, was fantastic.

2023-07-03,Fiorenza,"We had dinner here while being in Athens for holiday as both I and my husband really enjoy trying Michelin star restaurants. It’s definitely different from a lot of other starred restaurants in the sense that each dish of the 12-courses menu has a history in itself and it goes way beyond the simple tasting experience. It’s just pure magic! We enjoyed everything, from the appetizers to the dessert. What can be improved though is the service: in a 2-stars restaurant you expect definitely more attention to the guest (from the type of water You drink to the kindness of waiters)…definitely what you do not expect is having a waitress telling you that you cannot go to the restroom if then the next course comes 15 minutes later!… But again, the food is worth the whole experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r900027982-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,5,en

They expect them to be ‘Okay’ with their seafood menu which is not very appetising… The next best option was mushrooms which was extremely tangy and lacked flavour… I personally found it very disappointing because they couldn’t even cover up with some amazing desserts at the end that one would expect at such a highly rated restaurant.. Extremely average desserts after a disappointing meal..   Fine crockery, great service as expected and possibly the only thing they have worked on..

2023-04-09,riva_e_o,"after visiting Geranium we were really excited to try delta - as one of the chefs was assistant Head Chef there. the restaurant design was amazing - we were seated in front the window that overlooked the marine. the service was attentive and the dishes were unique in flavor.   so why the bad review? i belive that a 2 star MICHELIN  restaurant isn't just about good food but also the 360° experience - something phenomenal  that goes with you days later - this restaurant disappointed in that aspect.  as i do not eat pork i was served Turbot kissed by the fire and served with a sauce of seasonal offerings and my companions got the Pluma iberico seasoned . after 20 mins i told my husband that i have Heartburn. 10 min later i started to fell nausea and blamed it on fatigue and asked for tea. after 50 min from eating the  Turbot  i was trying not to throw up in the restaurant. came back to the hotel and as i laughingly said to my husband the next morning - ""i throw away 200 EURO to the toilet"".  it was a horrible night.    for concern to other guests and for the name of the restaurant i sent them  an email stating that i was not writing for a refund just for there knowledge as i was the only one that was so sick.   no email. no phone call - no nothing from them. not even how I'm feeling. waited a week an wrote this review.   so if you want to go to a restaurant that looks at you as as walking EURO and not as customer or a guest - enjoy.  i didn't.

2023-03-30,Nico,"I discovered that after reservation, the restaurant silently increased tasting menu price from 170 to 200 EUR.  The setting is stunning. A lot of space, high ceilings, trees floating in the air, an excellent view. The music, as in most reataurants, was (slightly) too loud, so that I didn‘t understand everything our waiter explained to us. Service was excellent in the beginning. The food was interesting and tasty, but the initial courses were too small. One course was literally just one little mushroom.  In the end, they dropped the ball completely. After the last course was served, they just forgot us. We had to ask multiple times for the bill. When we left, nobody said goodbye or even looked at us. Yes, the restaurant was full. But I simply expect more from a 2-star Michelin restaurant. For what we paid, I was disappointed. Price/value ratio is not good here. It also didn‘t help that there was a baby that made noise druing the whole evening. A restaurant like this should outright forbid the presence of small children.  Overall, disappointed not just with this restaurant, but with Michelin as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r884157586-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,3,en

2022-11-03,zvoomb,"We went to this aesthetically superb space in a building designed by Renzo Piano with great expectations, but we left somehow disappointed. Our experience from other 2-Michelin-stars restaurants made us hope for a memorable evening, yet tastewise there was something not right. Although visually the dishes—also the tableware—were stunning, they let us down. Many of them were often unfamiliarly sweet — we didn’t like, for instance, lobster with lotus fruit. There was seafood with strawberries and fish with prunes; are we traditionalists? Maybe. Yet we enjoy enormously Asian or fusion food. The menu was unbalanced: a long series of dishes based on seafood and fish, then suddenly only one with meat (Iberico) and then all of a sudden three deserts together. The wine served was also disappointing, there were some biodynamic wines who are not to everybody’s liking, although the pairing was good. Also, wine pairing started after the hors d’œuvres which means that one has to take an aperitif (we did), otherwise there is nothing there. The team that served us was impeccable, very professional and at the same time not pretentious and friendly. Our sommelier was a pleasure to listen to. One last thing: for my partner who hates fingerfood, there was a problem; a large part of the menu is to be eaten with the fingers. This restaurant has the potential to become better; we all know that Michelin stars are not everything, especially if other factors, such as service and aesthetics, contribute to their attribution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r867104434-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,4,en

2022-07-03,jbrown2665,"Friends suggested we visit “Delta” and although I was resistant, simply because I can be a picky eater, I must say that the dinner was outstanding, and the entire experience was absolutely perfect.   Although we had been to the Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center a few times in the past and have always loved it, this time was very different because we capped off the visit with an incredible, 13 course meal from two world class chefs and a staff that was equally trained to ensure that their guests left completely satisfied and with huge smiles.   Athens certainly has several world restaurants, some with Michelin stars, but this is without a doubt, my favorite. Delta is unique for sure. Each dish was a wonderful surprise of flavors, presentation, artistry, and they all perfectly test and satisfy your senses.   I could describe the dishes we had, but I believe that would destroy the experience of going because not knowing in advance and allowing these master chefs to surprise you with every plate is all part its intrigue.   Special thanks to the team that made our meal absolutely memorable in the very best of ways and for being able to keep a restless person like me not just engaged, but actually wanting more after each turn along their wonderful culinary journey.   One piece of advice though is to book the 17-course option instead of the 13 we had. We knew instantly, that the 13 course was a mistake and that we would be wanting and in fact, needing more. Because the restaurant is conscious of waste and sustainability, upgrading to the 17-course meal during your visit is impossible. However, we now know, and we will most certainly return and do it even better the next time around.   BRAVO, DELTA!!  We will see you again and we will definitely recommend you to everyone as you most certainly earned that and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r846098811-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,5,en

It was an extraordinary gastronomic journey, beginning with four amuse bouche where I fell in love with the fried oyster in miso, then we continued with seven dishes where colours and flavours  combined like magic. The main course was the lamb, it was very juicy and extremely tender. We had the opportunity to taste this dish inside the kitchen at the chef’s table and it was great seeing the chef’s team at work. The dinner closed with an amazing dessert, that combined tomatoes with raspberry, and with the friandise. Everything was perfect.

Wine paring goes from Kombucha, Sake, Sherry and biodynamic wines, adding an incredible feeling to each course.  We also ordered Krug 171eme by the glass, such a treat.

2024-07-09,Kristin R,"The best thing about this restaurant was the bread. The other (extremely meager) courses had poorly matched flavor and texture, heavily focused on grassiness. We left hungry and hassled because the service was prolonged as well. Despite our clear requests upon booking and arrival at the restaurant that we finish in 2.5 hours, they failed to complete service in under 3 hours, and we raced to the airport to catch our flight. To provide context, we have eaten in Michelin restaurants for over 30 years throughout Europe and the US, and this was the most disappointing meal to date. We have allergies and dietary requirements, which were fully communicated to the restaurant in advance, but they still struggled to serve a first amuse-bouche after 45 minutes of waiting. The staff became defensive, saying they had to adapt to the diets causing the delay, but this information had been provided long in advance. They simply were not prepared. One amuse-bouche of kohlrabi with sour broth and gummy mini dumplings lacked seasoning and enjoyable texture. It was served in a partially- hollowed kohlrabi on a bed of leaves, but 95% of what was plated was inedible. We regretted not having a goat with us to enjoy most of what was served. This dish also resulted in a stomach ache for my son, leaving him in the bathroom for much of the meal and unable to eat any further courses. (More on that later!)  The other amuse-bouche of a cucumber and leaf with green oily pesto was incredibly messy to eat. In general, it seemed like the chef had never tried to eat what he served because it was clumsy to eat the courses as presented with crockery and cutlery. A potato spaghetti dish was impossible to twirl on a fork and too big for the round, awkward spoon. I could go on and on about how they missed the mark on making food that was both delicious and elegant to eat. The dessert was a green, grassy dish that did nothing to finish the meal with any sweet satisfaction. The texture of swallowing leaf after leaf was wholly unenjoyable. One of the most glaring errors of the lunch was the plating of the post-dessert bite... a rhubarb custard was served in a clamshell on a bed of real snail shells. How inappropriate in general, but especially for the vegetarians in our group! As stated earlier, the only item anyone in our party would want to eat again was the bread, BUT when we asked for more, we were told that they only make enough rolls for the number of people booked each day. They managed to find one squashed piece for my son, but that was the only one left. Back to service and my son... as I mentioned, the strange vegetable combinations in the amuse-bouche gave him a terrible stomach ache, and he was unable to eat any of the further five courses in the meal. The staff NEVER asked if he was okay, despite my hinting that the food triggered his illness. They were more focused on fussing about, folding his napkin in a perfect triangle as he came and left from the bathroom. At the end, they tried to seem accommodating by offering to ""make an exception for him"" and serve him French fries not on the menu, but greasy food was not what a sick teenager needed. Their insensitivity is inexcusable. They charged him the full 150 euro, despite having eaten nothing because of his pain. As a point of comparison, we were at Taillevent 20 years ago, and one person in our group was ill and only eating small bites of every course. When the bill arrived, there was no charge for the ill gentleman's meal. We even enquired if there was a mistake, but the maître d'hôtel insisted that the restaurant only charged those who could enjoy a full Michelin gastronomic experience. Flore could learn something from the French. The arrogance and incompetence that we felt throughout the meal at Flore left us wondering how they maintain a 2* Michelin rating. The restaurant is oblivious to true client needs and incapable of making an exceptional dining experience. They operate in a little bubble within a luxury hotel, catering to tourists looking to be impressed by strange flavors and textures, rather than truly delicious ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r958689690-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,2,en

This team specialises in achieving some of the same textures and mouth experiences as you might expect from a regular meal eg the richness of a “meat” reduction to pair with a “steak” made of aubergine stuffed with vegetables and glazed to perfection. The vibrancy and colours made each dish a delight. An added bonus was being invited to sit at the kitchen table for one of the courses. The wine pairing was inventive, organic and good value.

2023-05-09,Heiwa-san,"We were surprised upon arrival when the waiter told us that tonight’s menu was completely vegetarian to celebrate Spring.  The restaurant mentions that it's menu is comprised of sustainable seafood and local vegetables.  That was a disappointment.  We also heard those same sentiments by other diners that evening.  However, the experience was wonderful, and the vegetarian dishes were visually appealing and tasted fresh, but the appearance of Kohlrabi multiple times lended to a bit of monotony in taste, as did the use of fermented yeast foam.  We did thoroughly enjoy our first course of 25 different vegetables at the Chef's table in the kitchen - that was fun and informative. The highlight was the Japanese-inspired chawan-mushi with tempura marigold flowers - that was the only non-vegetarian dish.  My wife had a glass of wine and I opted for the fruit and vegetable nonalcoholic drink pairing, which was interesting, and seemed to match well with each course.  Service was excellent, and the ambiance very serene and calm.  We had a window seat looking onto the canals which was very nice, especially at sunset.  Overall, the food was very attractive and expertly prepared offering many different textures and tastes, and we experienced something new - a vegetarian Michelin star experience.   However, we both left hungry and would have appreciated some seafood or bread - or at least some advance notice that the menu would be vegetarian.   Would  we return?  Probably not for another vegetarian experience but if you are a vegetarian, you might enjoy it immensely.

2024-09-28,Stanleyalb,"We had looked forward to coming to this restaurant for so long, that perhaps our expectations were unreasonably high.  The room is very plain and ‘ordinary’, not beautiful or remarkable in any way as I would normally expect a restaurant with three stars to be.  Similarly with the table service, plates, cutlery, etc.  The food itself was fascinating … the presentation, the minute detail with which it had obviously been prepared, the use of herbs and plants.  But did it taste good …. for us, no.  Perhaps our palates aren’t sufficiently well tuned, but each dish was insufficiently differentiated from the last and I like to finish my meal with something sweet.  Judging by the stars and the reviews, my husband and I are clearly in the minority, but I guess it’s all a matter of taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r971697273-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html,3,en

2019-06-16,RevdIain,"This was our fifth visit to La Marine - no trip to France is now complete without coming here. We had the 6-course menu but that's a bit misleading because there were no fewer than 8 amuses-bouches and 5 petits fours!  The former included the famous Noirmoutier potatoes, squid, radish, smoked mullett, creme de menthe with cucumber, delicious truffle fish balls with a coffee centre which melt in the mouth, clam consommé and, believe it or not, fennel cream with cheese ice cream, strawberry sauce and mackerel. Now we are ready to start the meal proper! First was oysters from the boat 'Erika' with a squid sauce, then white asparagus with embers of pine cones, then hake with cherry and green beans and almond milk. Whiting followed and then 'Bois de la Chaize' with elements representing the woods on the island - and finally a lovely rhubarb dessert.  We had the wine flight to accompany all this - a muscadet de sevre et maine, a Cotes de Duras, a Macon Chaintré, a Côtes du Rhône and finally a local Vendée sweet wine.  Alexandre Couillon is so creative, mixing old favourites and completely new dishes and the staff led by Céline are so friendly, helpful and informal that the whole experience is a joy.

2019-05-06,Didsthewinegeek,"Definitely an experience to savour. 5 or 6 hors d' oeuvres before the 6  course lunch that the chef created a story and experience with. There were some memorable dishes and flavours. Foremost in my mind, the little dish of carrot ginger and winkle. For my son who dined with me, the hake and carrot dish. Forgettable for me was the initial dish of potato done 3 ways and the radish with a pine sauce, the freshness and fieryness of the radish destroyed the surprisingly delicate flavour of the pine sap sauce. The whiting dish was just a little too delicate. The hake dish though excellent and the chocolate dessert memorable. The little sweets with coffee were another dessert in themselves, with the return of carrot and ginger but in dessert form. Also a memorable beetroot and aniseed biscuit.   Definitely a meal to remember.

2018-06-17,RevdIain,"It was La Marine that introduced us to Michelin-starred restaurants a number of years ago. We have been to quite a few since but, as we return here for the fourth time, its combination of superb food, lovely staff and excellent value are hard to beat. We were given a warm welcome and shown to a table by the window. The menu here gives no choice - except the number of courses! We chose the six-course one (we could have had 9) but that is very misleading because, no sooner have you made your decision, the amuses-bouches start to arrive - six of them but two of them were trios. The first is the signature dish of Noirmoutier potatoes - one made into an ice-cream, one a 'crisp' and the third a warm soup - the perfect strat to what will be a perfect meal. Then followed a sardine dish, smoked mackerel, a clam on a biscuit, an amazing hot mackerel ball with coffee (that sounds very odd but, believe you me, it explodes with flavour in the mouth!), then another trio, the first: strawberry and pepper soup with cheese ice cream, then tomato with sweet and sour sauce with crab and finally leak and onion soup. All this accompanied by lovely bread, one made with seaweed with two sorts of butter, one of them also made with seaweed. Now for the first course! Raw young tuna with petits pois and raspberries. Course 2: a huge barbecued white asparagus in a pine-cone sauce and (we think!) salmon roe. Course 3:  A filet of whiting with cherries and samphire and an almond sauce. Course 4: breast of Challans duck with condiments from the Marine garden The last two courses were fine desserts, an ice cream made with smoked milk and lastly, 'a walk in the woods' (you just have to experience it!).  The portions here are generous and we have to admit that we were unable to finish the petits-fours. We chose to accompany all this with the sommelier's choice of wines and enjoyed generous glasses of a 2016 Sevre et Maine, a 2017 Cote de Catalan, a 2016 Toulouse wine (La Colombiere), a lovely Val de Loire red and lastly a dessert wine from Anjou. The bill came to 372 euros including two cocktails maison, two coffees and one Armagnac. This is a lot of money but extremely good value for a restaurant of this outstanding quality - we have paid more in one-star places in Britain.  We arrived at 19.30 and left at 23.00 having had another mind-blowingly memorable culinary experience. Céline Couillon and her team make everything work so smoothly and are informal and informative. Alexandre Couillon is simply a master of his trade.  We were here 15th June 2018 and we will be back - we say that every time but we mean it!

2018-02-05,ViatorNarra,"Dined here recently and can only recommend this amazing restaurant. The menu of which you may chose a standard version with 6 courses or an extended version with 3 additional courses is certainly not the cheapest and there is no a la carte option but every morsel you are going to enjoy is worth a trip to this beautiful place. Set in a ancient fisherman's house on the port basin of l'Herbaudiere in Noirmoutier right opposite the Wholesale Fish Market. The island has a reputation for its Bonnotte Potato and Crystal sea salt.  The seasonal Menu is preceded by 6 hot and cold amuse-bouches, home-made bread using beer-yeast accompanied by simply: seaweed-butter. It is probably the best bread I have ever tasted, a slight taste of sea, a great fluffy but firm texture and an amazing crust.  Using only seasonal veggies from the restaurants own kitchen-garden local fish from the neighbouring fishery and the famous poultry from Challans, the chef respects the four seasons, guarantees 1st class freshness and avoids long supply chains. The chef's creations were not exaggerated, no crazy combinations and a matching glass of wine for each course made me swing through the menu with joy and pleasure. Highlight was the Poulet a la Mue de Vendee (a Chicken fed with cows milk and toast for 2 weeks) accompanied by Langoustine and Parsnip. There is certainly lots to tell about his deserts.: one if them combines Mushroom, Celeriac and Honey (own production) as a desert - just amazing.   There are not many tables here so making a reservation well ahead is recommended, especially during high season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r558618655-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html,5,en

I have nothing negative to say, this experience will stay with us for a long time, but a few tips for future visitors: * When asked about an aperitif, say yes, otherwise you will only have water to accompany the lovely amuse-bouche. Champagne worked great for us :) * I strongly recommend a stay at the next door Maison Moizeau, also run by the Couillon family, and therefore the same quality and attention to detail (and opened its gates in July 2017( * If you stay at the hotel, pay extra for breakfast.

We ordered the 6-course menu, partially for the famous ""Erika"" oyster, and so began the amazing lunch experience that was started with an additional 6 welcome dishes before the first starter dish came. We sat through three hours of a delightful food journey, ranging from perfectly barbecued asparagus, to the famous shapeless Erika oyster, and to the lovely mains of fish and duck that were cooked to ultimate perfection.  The experience was topped off with meeting with Alexandre Couillon himself, who was visibly busy from the kitchen work, but was happy to take a photo with these eager tourists and showed us the exquisite fireplace that was one of the opening scenes in the episode, and was also used to smoke one of their ice cream desserts.

2017-05-10,united33,"We had been meaning to visit La Marine for some time and finally got around to it and what a pleasure it was.  The outside is quite unprepossessing but one immediately gets taken up a level in the reception.   We had decided as we had eventually booked and arrived there we would have the 9 course menu with matched wine.  My wife and I had a debate about a glass of champagne as an apéro. We decided against it as we have found some restaurants can overdo the quantity of wine served ( yes I know you don't have to drink it all!).   I think in retrospect it was a mistake as it would have been perfect with the exquisite canapés, there was one truffles like one with mackerel and coffee that was perfect.  I won't describe every course but for me there were two highlights. L'huître Noire, I generally think chefs cannot improve oysters but this dish was superb. The other course I really enjoyed was The Pintade it was without doubt the most tender, perfectly prepared and served guinea-fowl I've ever had.   The wines were not grand wines but the matching as one would expect worked. There was a local focus on the which included Muscadet and a Pinot Noir from Brem. I did find the Côtés de Jura both novel and interesting as I was unaware of it.   I mentioned that it's unpretentious it's a smallish restaurant, my wife and I were in the catch all 'smart casual' other diners also but at either end of the definition. The staff were really relaxed there was not the question 'are you enjoying it' after every mouthful and they did not hover. They were friendly and happy to engage in conversation about the food.

But the 9 dish menu is also terribly tempting (lobster!). Staff is charming and very attentive. They were very accommodating to one in our party who was pregnant and couldn't eat raw fish. They whipped up langoustines for her, in place of the oyster for example.  The only thing amiss was that the chef didn't come out of the kitchen to go round the tables, when it is a very small restaurant et cosy. It would have been lovely to congratulate him in person.

This is a 100% vegetarian restaurant (that can easily do vegan if you wish) and will impress even the most picky of meat eaters. It is extraordinary what the chefs can do with vegetables.  First, the location is perfect. Just across the road from a Ming Dynasty temple, King's Joy sits quietly amongst a bustling Beijing cityscape. You could walk right past the restaurant and have no idea what was inside. It is a remodeled courtyard home from ages ago, and its modern elegance hides its ancient past. Amazing spot to eat!  Secondly, the food is as beautiful as it is delicious. Each portion is small but I promise you, you will leave full. The servers explain what you are eating as they bring it out, all of it local, all of it delicious. You get so many flavors and textures your tastebuds will explode in the best ways possible.  Thirdly, and certainly not last, the service is impeccable. Our server the first night, a *super* friendly and knowledgable guy named Jack, was as impressionable as the food and played a huge role in our decision to come back and dine there again. He spoke perfect English and was a wealth of information and friendliness. Should you choose to dine at King's Joy - and you should - request Jack as your main server; he truly felt like a friend and was a significant part of our experience.  Please, do yourself a favor and dine at this restaurant during your stay in Beijing. Should we visit the city again we will absolutely eat here again - twice at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r971095692-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,5,en

But boy what a disappointment , first of all they force you to pick same price /set course menu for all people on the table, which is limited the option to try different things. They have 3 sets of menu with different prices. My dad was upset about that but I was still hope the food is good, but the disappointment continues, same material repeat on most of dishes, basically tofu, bamboo or mushrooms , tastes is not good at all,  I was really questioning how they even got 3 Michelin stars?!

2024-06-17,E. B.,"For my wife’s birthday, we wanted a dining experience as special as the occasion itself during our stay in Beijing. We chose ""King's Joy,"" a renowned vegetarian restaurant celebrated for its culinary artistry and elegant ambiance—think big plates, small food, live music, and everything else that accompanies what seemed like sophisticated dining. While the restaurant largely lived up to its reputation, a few aspects left us with mixed feelings.  Highlights  From the moment we entered King's Joy, the ambiance set a tone of serene elegance. The restaurant's decor, a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and traditional Chinese design, created a warm and inviting atmosphere. Soft lighting and tasteful decor added to the intimate and cozy feeling, making it an ideal setting for our celebration.  The food at King's Joy was nothing short of exceptional. The highlight of our meal was the ""Nostoc Maize Grain in Burdock,"" a dish that perfectly showcased the chef's ability to elevate simple vegetarian ingredients into something truly extraordinary.  Adding to the enchanting atmosphere was a live harp performance by a talented musician near our table. Her soothing melodies provided a beautiful, calming backdrop to our meal, enhancing the overall experience and making our celebration feel even more special.  Another highlight of our dinner was the waiter who served us. His English was good, and although we had difficulty hearing his explanations of each dish clearly (we were seated right besides the harpist), he maintained a high level of professionalism and courtesy throughout the evening.  Peasant's Sadness  It is at this point that we, the peasants, experienced sadness. Despite the many positives, our experience was marred by a few disappointing moments. Some staff members appeared to be amused by our attempts to navigate the nuances of the ""cuisine sino-française haut de gamme"" and our unfamiliarity with certain dining customs. As visitors from the West, this behavior made us feel self-conscious and somewhat uncomfortable (no hard feelings, ladies; just try to be a bit more discreet...).  Moreover, we were seated at a large table for six, right in the middle of the restaurant, rather than at a smaller, more intimate table for two as we had hoped. This central location detracted significantly from the private and reclusive ambiance we had envisioned for our celebration.  Conclusion  In a sense, ""King's Joy"" offers a remarkable dining experience with its exquisite food, serene ambiance, and delightful live music. It stands as a top destination for those looking to celebrate special occasions with vegetarian cuisine in Beijing. However, the occasional lapses in respectful service and the less-than-ideal seating arrangements slightly dampened what could have been a flawless evening. Despite these issues, ""King's Joy"" remains a worthy choice for a more-than-average dining experience.  -----------  在北京旅行期间，为了庆祝我妻子的生日，我们想要一个与这特殊时刻相匹配的特别的用餐体验。我们选择了 “京兆尹”，一 家以其烹饪艺术和优雅氛围而闻名的素食餐厅——想象一下大盘子、小食物、现场音乐，以及所有看起来像是精致用餐的一切。虽然餐厅在很大程度上达到了它的声誉，但某些方面让我们有些失望。  优点  从我们踏入京兆尹的那一刻起，氛围就营造出一种宁静的优雅。餐厅的装饰，现代精致与传统中式设计的和谐结合，营造了一个温馨而令人愉悦的环境。柔和的灯光和精美的装饰增加了温馨和舒适的感觉，使它成为我们庆祝的理想场所。  京兆尹的食物简直是无与伦比的。我们这顿饭的亮点是 “黄花菜玉米粒搭配牛蒡”，这道菜完美展示了厨师将简单的素食食材提升为真正非凡的能力。  为我们用餐增添魅力的是一位才华横溢的音乐家在我们桌旁演奏的竖琴。她舒缓的旋律为我们的晚餐提供了一个美丽、平静的背景，增强了整体体验，使我们的庆祝活动显得更加特别。现场音乐为这次晚餐增添了个性化和优雅的色彩。  我们晚上的另一个亮点是为我们服务的服务员。他的英语非常流利，尽管由于我们离竖琴手很近，很难清楚地听到他对每道菜的解释，但他整个晚上都保持了高度的专业性和礼貌。  农民的悲伤  在这一点上，我们这些农民感到了悲伤。尽管有很多优点，我们的体验却被一些令人失望的时刻所掩盖。某些工作人员似乎对我们尝试理解 “高档中法混合料理” 和我们对某些用餐习俗的不熟悉感到有些好笑。作为来自西方的游客，这种行为让我们感到不自在和有点不安（没有恶意，女士们；只是希望你们能更隐晦一点)。在一家像京兆尹这样声名显赫的餐厅中，遇到这种不专业的行为令人惊讶。  此外，我们被安排在餐厅中间的一张六人桌，而不是我们所希望的更小、更亲密的双人桌。这种中央位置显著地削弱了我们对庆祝活动的私人和隐蔽氛围的预期。我们发现自己处在活动的中心，工作人员和顾客经常经过，这使我们很难享受我们为这特殊晚上所期望的温馨、隐蔽的氛围。  结论  从某种意义上说，“京兆尹”提供了一个卓越的用餐体验，其美味的食物、宁静的氛围和迷人的现场音乐使其成为在北京庆祝特殊场合的素食餐饮的首选之地。然而，偶尔的不尊重服务和不理想的座位安排略微影响了本来可能是完美的夜晚。尽管存在这些问题，“京兆尹” 仍然是一次愉快的用餐体验的值得推荐的选择。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r955513928-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,3,en

2024-02-15,Traveler2009,"King’s Joy is one of those restaurants that try to offer a culinary journey across their country, using a tasting, set menu.  There is no question that the food has been exquisite, and it does indeed offer a chance to experience ingredients from across China.  Also, it’s worth mentioning that the menu is 100% vegetarian!  Just like in any tasting restaurant each dish comes with a story. In this case it also comes along with an amazing presentation.    The wine menu is impressive as mentioned by many reviewers and you will for sure find something for your taste.       There are a few areas of improvement that I could suggest.  First off, having a sommelier available, or providing a bit of wine education for the staff would help – a lot.   Second, the food is really spectacular however some of the dishes would be even better when paired with the right drinks.  In my case I went with a Chardonnay that was great for most of the dishes, but some of the dishes clearly called out for a red wine.  It would be worthwhile for the restaurant to offer a drinks pairing menu. Third and last point, would be on providing even more training for the staff and improving on the marketing – the restaurant definitely has a story that needs to be told correctly. For non-Chinese customers, the restaurant should work a little bit on making sure the translation actually conveys the correct message!  At the end of the meal the waiter is offering dumplings or noodles.   The translation should emphasize that noodles at the end of the meal is a Chinese tradition – as you will see in many many restaurants. The waiter that attended me was speaking reasonably good English, but clearly not fluent.  His explanation of serving noodles, was to ensure clients are not hungry at the end of the meal….  With the portions being pretty small, it is possible that some customers could still be hungry by the end of the meal. Nevertheless, this is where a bit of savvy marketing would come in handy, not to mention that noodles at the end of a meal are the norm!  Also, this is an amazing vegetarian restaurant. Even more so considering it is located in China, which is not the first destination that comes to mind for vegetarian dishes.  The restaurant has some serious work to do on marketing and presentation of it’s story!  The setting of the restaurant, the décor, the service is very nice and comfortable like you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant.  Getting in is literally taking you to another world or peace and serenity, 100% opposite to the hustle and bustle of the street.  This is not a value restaurant by any stretch of imagination.  It’s clearly designed to be an amazing experience, and that it is! For me the experience was great, but not to die for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r938452171-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,5,en

Firstly,the diner in environment perfectly matches the topic of how traditional PEK restaurant looks like, therefore, from the setting address, interior decoration & service quality,it can be seen that the owner spend his own enthusiasm for the restaurant. At least, According to the previous mentioning terms , the only Michelin three stars vegetarian restaurant is an absolute right evaluation. Secondly, for the term of cuisine, the main course such as quinoa boletus wellington with red wine pineapple grapefruit enzymes is highly recommended, because, there is no difference between this & real steaks in taste & appearance.  Lastly, usually having fine dinner with wine is a routine for any type of Michelin restaurant, yet, for this restaurant, it offers different juice to service corresponding cuisines.

2021-01-01,Tashy007,"We were lucky to dine at ‘Memories’ restaurant. At the moment only hotel guests can book with the restaurant and the public outside cannot due to COVID. So it was easier to book but still we had to wait for a few days.  We didn’t know what to expect but had heard so many positive reviews.  We were not disappointed. It was amazing. The food was so flavourful and Chef Sven Wassmer allows the ingredients to shine. Who knew the plain potato could taste so good. We also chose to do the wine pairings and the wine chosen complimented each dish and added an extra complexity to the dishes. The sauces which included ingredients like pine oil tasted and smelt amazing and I made sure I scraped the dishes clean, not to leave any sauce behind.  The staff are so knowledgeable and friendly and surprised us with a little cake as we were celebrating my husband’s birthday.  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant and would suggest that you allow yourself to be open to go on this food/wine journey. The menu journey through ‘winter in the alps’ was brilliant. I look forward to sampling the other seasonal menu journeys in the future.

2020-02-17,Shelby L,"The best meal of my life. I went for the 12 course meal with wine pairing and didn't regret it. The staff were all so passionate about their jobs and had a story for each course. Every bite was well thought out and lovingly made. From clover, to fir, cheese water (cheese with no protein but all of the taste), char, venison, pulled pork and so much more. Sourced from almost exclusively local producers, this meal satisfied and surprised me. The bread was so lovely, with a crunchy exterior and perfectly soft inside. I could see the baker had carefully prepared his starter and experimented with various flours until he found the perfectly milled version. I had to hold myself back from eating it all for fear of filling myself too much to be able to finish the meal. Taking my tastebuds on a tour of the local farms with all of their innovative ideas and respect for traditional methods, I made my way through dish after dish. Each as spectacular as the last. In between dishes I could smell the smells of various things being prepared and it got me excited for what was coming next. The wine pairings complemented the food so well and were a show of their own. Finally the decor was lovely, providing warmth, class and privacy as I enjoyed my meal. Even the logo with its Swiss mountain M and moon O were cleverly incorporated. I will definitely be back!! Thank you to everyone on the team for sharing their amazing talents!

2024-03-11,Thomas K,"A wonderful evening in a fantastic restaurant.  From the very beginning, the service was courteous and very attentive.   A lot has been written about the restaurant by many people. Some people talk about ""food from the gods"", others about ""out of this world"". Some agree that this is a real treat and will be etched in one's memory. And so do we.  It is always a real pleasure to be here. The snacks get you in the mood for the evening. The menu varies depending on the season, but certain ""classics"" are always on it. This was also the case with our visit with the char and the ""Knöpfli"". Here you really want to take your plate to the kitchen and ask for a second helping. But you would also like to have more of the mashed potatoes with the old cow despite or precisely because of all the butter.  We can only recommend everyone to eat here on a special day, for example. It is an absolute delight.

2024-02-29,joker59,"Sven Wassmer's cuisine has a wow factor all its own. He seems to be a chef who stays away from gimmicks and technical tricks and tries to win over the guest with a unique approach that is difficult to put into words. What seems so pleasantly sparse and uncomplicated on the plate is actually full of intricate details that create deep and balanced flavors. The high-quality ingredients that he certainly uses reflect a close affinity with Switzerland. Bold and full of contrast, honest and accessible - this is the kind of food you would like to come across more often! Just think of being served something as crude as Kässpätzle in a three-star restaurant, but then being served something that suddenly takes the rug from under your feet and that you will remember for the rest of your life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g198797-d19003653-r940193690-Sven_Wassmer_Memories-Bad_Ragaz_Canton_of_St_Gallen.html,5,en

2024-07-20,grandflex P,"The prawn was cooked to perfection; its natural sweetness was fully pronounced, and its taste blended in well with the pea puree. The fava bean was the one element of the recipe that I personally found to be extremely off-putting; otherwise, it seemed like a well-balanced dish. The meal got its name because of the way the small triangle ""sandwiches"" were arranged, like a domino effect.

2023-09-14,Molly S,"So, we really wanted to like this place. We booked it for our last night in Tokyo, and this was our first three-star Michelin restaurant experience. It was a mixed experience and overall a disappointment.  Service was overall excellent. The staff were very friendly and professional. The only weird part was at the end of our meal we felt abandoned. They had offered us hot beverages and we declined, saying we were very full and tired. After that we waited about 15-20 minutes for the bill, which didn't come, so I got up to see if we could pay at the front. When I got up someone did come over to escort me to the restroom, at which point I asked if we pay at the table or the front counter, and they brought the bill to the table a couple minutes later. They were very accommodating and called us a taxi which arrived just a few minutes later.  The ambience was really nice in the restaurant. The lighting was very intentional and the tables were spaced out so we felt like we had our own little corner of the restaurant.  The food was the biggest disappointment. Some dishes were better than others, but no dishes stood out as incredible. Most were forgettable, and a couple were just bad. There was a narrative/theme for the meal, but it got lost about halfway through.  We started off strong with crispy vegetables and dipping sauce--simple and tasty. The next dish was a pike conger eel risotto which was torched at the table, so that was fun and also tasted good--this was my fiance's favorite dish. My favorite dish was probably the salad, where they used 57 different vegetables/greens. I appreciated the story behind it and it was a fun experience to eat. They also brought cards that listed all the ingredients and where each was from. Most ingredients were from small farms across Japan.   After the salad, the meal declined in quality and also lost the magic of the story they were trying to tell. There was a bread course. I love bread, so I was very excited for this. It was good, but not great. The focaccia rolls were served cold, and they were a bit dense. They served them out of the baking dish, so I'm not sure why they chose to serve them cold, but I think they would have been better fresh. The radish dish, which they keep on the menu at all times, was ok. The explanation behind the radish dish was that radishes naturally change flavor over seasons, so they encourage people to come back and try it again as the seasons change. It was nicely cooked.  The next dish was a fried small whole fish (ayu). We appreciated that this was an elevated take on a traditional Japanese dish. We were instructed to eat the head whole and then eat the body with the sauces. I'm not a big fan of eating crispy fried whole heads of things, but that's just me. The head reminded me a lot of botan ebi, but it wasn't very flavorful. Unsurprisingly, it was a little hard for me to eat, and I didn't love the fish guts throughout the fish either, but I understand that's just a personal preference and we were there to try new things. The sauces were just ok. I have a feeling the traditional grilled fish on a stick with sauce would have been more interesting and tastier than their elevated version.  The next dish, the main course, was by far the worst. It was duck, served rare, with a red wine sauce. The duck was very chewy and I got a tendon in mine that I couldn't chew through and had to decide whether to spit it into a napkin or politely swallow it. I chose the latter and it was gross. My fiance's cut didn't have tendons in it, but it was still chewy and he had a difficult time getting through it. The dish was served with a side of asparagus with cream sauce, which was very mild and forgettable. I've had rare duck with wine sauce before, and this was the worst version I've had, but also there was nothing interesting about this dish. It didn't fit the story of the meal, it wasn't creative, and it didn't taste good. Unfortunately, it was one of the bigger portions of the night also, so I ended up not being able to finish mine cause I started feeling nauseous trying to get through it.  The cheese course was nice. Tiny bits of cheese with sauce droplet pairings. It wasn't anything to write home about, but I love cheese so I appreciated that they included some.  The dessert was a couple courses and was uneven in quality. Some confections were better than others, but none wowed me, and some were just unbalanced and not good. The drink pairings for the dessert course also made the desserts taste worse. At one point we had a raspberry grapefruit drink, peanut milk drink, and matcha on the table all at once and the flavors were really jarring.  We could hear the couple next to us talking about their meal throughout the night, and they were not having a better time than us. When their duck dish came out we overheard the guy say to his wife, ""Should we just leave?""  With the non-alcoholic beverage pairings, our meal came out to almost $700, which is the most I've spent on a meal, and it was certainly not in the top 100 meals I've had. I don't understand why this restaurant has three Michelin stars, and it definitely made me less likely to try Michelin recommendations in the future. It's worth noting that they seem to have roughly doubled the price of their food in the past few years. If it had been half the cost, and we hadn't gone in expecting a three-star experience, I think we would have had a better time. However, as it was, it was quite disappointing.   We still had a fun night, but mostly because it was a shared bonding experience of disappointment and trying to figure out how the food could be so mediocre yet highly acclaimed.  I am sure a lot of skill went into many of the dishes we were served, and I do think the chef/owner put thought and effort into the meal and experience. I'm not trying to question anyone's skill or talent, but the experience was not for us, and I would not recommend the restaurant given the relatively high cost.

2023-07-02,Elizabeth C,"I was lucky my friend was able to snag this lunch reservation for her birthday celebration in Tokyo/Kyoto :)  When my husband and I were visitors of Japan, we did try out another 2-star Michelin place in Tokyo...and it was regrettably very forgettable...and I won't name it or review it, which is why it has been 6 yrs since for Tokyo.    Not L'Effervescence!  I was very impressed with the very creative and sophisticated non-alcoholic pairing option that my friend went for - the other friend and I did a split pairing with the wine. I also appreciated the sustainability approach, with local ingredients.  The turnip dish was so delicious.  I know this may not be a huge deal for others who like their meat rare, I'm usually a medium, and not a brave person with rare poultry... it was the first time one of my friends and I braved eating a medium rare duck - and it was delicious. Usually, I'm the one a bit embarrassed & disappointing the server and possibly the chefs when I cannot eat the rarer duck or squab that is brought out, but to my surprise, I took a bite and finished it - it was divine.  In terms of cost and value, I would say it's a fair price and great value.  I guess I am comparing it to 2 facilities in California, and with the wine pairing, the California counterparts were more expensive, and I would only recommend 1/2 in California.   If this is your one splurge or one fine-dining French/Japanese restaurant, I would go with this.

2019-11-10,D Koa,"Some of the finest french restaurants in the world are located in Japan.  French and Italian cuisines are considered the standard for fine dining occasions by the Japanese, so I have been told by a Tokyo-ite. Choosing with French restaurant to patronize during our time in Tokyo was not easy since there are so many.    We decided on L'Effervescence due to the reputation of Chef Shinobu-san, who opened the restaurant in 2010, in combining french cooking techniques with japanese flavours.      The restaurant is located on a quiet street (I believe residential in nature) and the dining room has that calm, romantic, sophisticated modern feel to it.  The food is impeccably prepared and is delicious.  There is only tasting menu during the dinner service: Renaissance.  It is a 12-course meal comprised of ingredients that highlight all that Japan has to offer.    The restaurant is renown for its Tokyo turnip which is cooked for 4 hours but we did not find it to be a compelling experience.  It was good but beyond that we couldn't understand why this is the flag-bearer for the restaurant.    All courses were delicious; nothing disappointed us.  I opted to have the non-alcoholic fruit juice pairing.  I received 4 different home-made juices and while they are all delicious I would have preferred the pour to be larger.  Each pour was maybe 2 or 3 ounces, at best.    Service was very good.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff made every attempt to speak English to us and it was very much appreciated.    I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r725508317-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,4,en

The sophisticated ambience as you enter the dinning room following your seat in the “waiting room” sets a high standard for the food to meet, it does and then some.  Quality of service is second to none and the tasting menu is a delight to behold, an example being the salad course which is a picture on your plate then to be told there are fifty different items on your plate and here is a list of the items.

We were treated to a Japanese tea ceremony and a special birthday dessert. The food was superb and the champagne the best I've ever tasted. We had fun with the waiter trying to explain to him that the dessert was toffee. Google Translate came to the rescue. For the first time ever I was escorted to the bathroom and the waiter apologised for it being occupied and directed me to their comfortable lounges to wait on. So courteous and customer friendly. When we reluctantly left, our waiter chased after us with two slices of cake.

2019-08-19,StephanK723,"Amazing food close or at 3 star level for any restaurant globally out there. Perfectly combining Japanese produce with french cooking techniques. We enjoyed the lunch, which was a great deal at 10k ¥. Scallop sashimi, Tokyo turnip, Ayu in a buckwheat crepe, summer venison with sea snail purée all where outstanding. Quite exciting for me the freeze dried and fried Ayu for me, but the best in taste was the venison with the umami of the sea snail purée, closely before the absolutely balanced scallops. Just above almost every restaurant I was before was the impeccable service. Maybe we are not used to the incredible politeness of Japanese people right now at the beginning of our journey through Japan but this was truly world class. The wine is definitely on the the more adventurous side with lots of biodynamic or vin naturel producers on the list (especially from Japan). I took the special pairing and it was quite exciting.

2019-07-09,ted m,"Lunch at L'Effervescence, located in a quiet section of the city. Multi-course set menu the only option where the starter- a Guinea fowl jelly based dish worked well.  The following; maybe too twee riff on a McDonald's apple pie parcel was a bit muddled and consequently less successful, though still tasty enough. The following horse mackerel sashimi and noodle dish was a triumph and probably the best dish of the set. The signature cooked turnip a real disappointment as it managed to be both watery, bland and with an unpleasant mouth feel. The parsley sauce didn't work as a counterpoint and the Basque ham was missing in action. The whole fish and buckwheat pancake again a little clumsy and difficult to eat though had great flavours happening . The following pork dish was terrific as was the fruit based dessert. The tea ceremony finale also a nice touch.  Ingredients were first class and generally solid technique from the kitchen.    A lack of really good English on the part of the staff (otherwise very professional and polished) made explanation of the dishes problematic, though the menu card helped. A stylish and elegant room with exceptional tableware.  Small,high quality wine list weighted to high end offerings.... no bargains here, though the Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling was a great wine.  We are huge fans of Japanese Chefs cooking in the French tradition.... built a trip to Paris around just that, so it was interesting to see what was being done locally by a Japanese Chef cooking more within his own tradition but within a European context.

2019-06-12,ryu0803,"This is a stylish restaurant and we love the ambience a lot. It is definitely a venue to celebrate special occasion. Unfortunately our dinner was a bit disappointing.  Service was attentive but the young man who served our table spoke English with a heavy Japanese accent. It was difficult for us to get what he was telling us about the dishes and we had to refer to the menu frequently. At Narisawa, everyone spoke perfect English and it greatly enhanced the dining experience.  They served only the Renaissance set menu and we did not find the food memorable. The salad was made with many kinds of vegetable prepared in different ways. They even presented a menu with the salad introducing the origin of the ingredients. The dish was similar to the signature salad we had at Den but it was not as delicious in taste nor as interesting in texture. We were told the 4 hours cooked turnip is the Chef’s signature dish. It reminded us the potato we had at Core by Clare Smyth in London not long ago. They both share the same concept of turning something simple into gourmet. Clare’s potato was out of this world and we could not have imagined a humble potato could be the star of the evening. On the other hand, the turnip was just a turnip and the flavour was underwhelming. We also did not find the apple pie #38 with prawn and goat cheese appealing. The cheese course with 3 tiny pieces of cheese was also poorly presented.  Some reviewers considered the tea ceremony pretentious but we must disagree. We enjoyed the performance and it was unique and a very nice ending to the dinner.

2024-04-28,Laura M,"Interior is simple, but beautifully decorated in an old charming building. Staff is friendly. The food was great and the menu was well planned around local ingredients. What was little annoying that staff did not communicate with each other. For example, when we ordered drinks and I asked my aperitiv and wine same time. My wine came after a second course or the wine pairing drink came AFTER the food. Not so professional. Or if we ordered more drinks, after somewhile someone came to ask do we want something to drink. We had to explain these kind of issues over 6 times, ""we already ordered"".  We asked a bill and after 15minutes someone came to ask do we want something more? Very frustrating when we had to explain many times ourselves. Not a relaxing way to have a dinner.

2023-10-21,Niko K,"Over all excellent new tastes. But in the main warm dish (was not that warm), there was scale and some dirt from the forest. Also there was said that there is some puree with the fish, but was there any? Tempura was not crispy, it was soft and doughy, and missing salt or taste over all. The egg butter dish could have had also more salt, as well as the ""left overs dish"" from the fish. In Michelin star restaurant You should be happy without questions after dinner.

2021-12-15,SeanSky,"In Nuremberg on business and decided to go all-in for the best possible dinner experience.  If you have dined somewhere like Alinea (Chicago, IL), you know what fine dining can be -- Essigbraetien has earned its stars and deserves three!  From the moment you enter, you are treated as the only guests.  Trust the front of house and the kitchen staff to leave you feeling ""blown away"".  If you are an enophile, definitely include the wine pairing - selections from their cellar are perfectly matched with each course - and you will not find these wines in a retail store.  Very intimate setting but still appropriate for a business dinner for two.  Worth every euro and every moment spent dining with this team!  Frankly, this restaurant is the one reason to travel to Germany!  To the restaurant - please forgive that my review is in English.  But, language was no barrier to an amazing evening.

If you’re looking for meat in every dish, based on the one night we dined here, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a diverse meal this should be a must.

2018-07-09,iloveeshly,"We dine for the past 10 years all over the world in the best restaurant as part of our job to cater to our high class clients. I personally adore vegetables and bland food. My partner is a vegetarian. We both eat tiny portions, but I felt like I've been given literally one slice of leek over the whole evening. Luckily I went for the 7 course menu that included a hip of lamb, so I wasn't going home completely starved as my girlfriend did who went for the 4 course meal instead. I wasn't asked how I like the meat, it was bloody medium rare. It was tender but nothing spectacular. Just a good piece of lamb, chewy tho and hard to cut without a steak knife. It was still the highlight of my dinner that gave me some filling satisfaction. We both love healthy, regional organic food- but the price is just ridiculously high for what it is-  Poor people food (leeks, celery, onion)  Delicious, but for that price I'm expecting lobster, Beluga Caviar,  Wagyu Beef and Champagne. We payed 400 Dollar for 2, only had 2 regional glasses of wine and came home hungry. Yes, the dishes were super cute presented in extremely tiny portions and beautifully arranged but nothing spectacular out of this world that's new or not seen before.  The windows were open the whole evening, attracting lots of flies into the glasses of water and wine. Maybe a net over the open window would be useful. We give the one star for the excellent service, that was really spectacular. You can tell the servants are highly trained and skilled. The door was held open, the napkin was replaced when falling on the floor immediately and the staff spoke perfect English. It was also great to see the chef comming to the tables. We only give one star in total because the price in comparison to what is offered is really not appropriate. Complimentary choclate chunks are given at the end which is really nice, but now I feel a bit sick eating all of them because of the hunger, smaller choclate would match the tiny menu. A note about holding a conversation down in this small formal room would be good with the mostly American visitors that evening talking  so loudly we knew all about their private business at the end of the evening. My partner is American and felt offended by their loud conversations. We missed some kind of gentle music. Unfortunately live music in not cherished anywhere when it gives such a great atmosphere. We expected to be blown away but we are quite surprised of what people think is unique and out of this world.....To us it's everyday healthy food that should be served in bigger portion for cheaper. We would be eating there daily. But with literally one leek on the plate you can't go home satisfied. We haven't regret going there tho, we had a great evening. We would not go back. Thank you for the great attentive and professional table service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r594762405-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,1,en
2018-06-25,Brian Randall,"Having dined in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years, this year our visit was to Nuremberg and consequently Essigbratlein. Possibly rather more quaint than other starred restaurants we had visited, from ringing the bell to enter to the internal décor. As one would expect, service was impeccable but pleasantly jovial. Now for the difference, that lies in the unusual style of food, from the many amuse bouches to the clever and possibly unique use of vegetables. The menu I shall be posting with this review has lost a great deal in translation and is over simplified beyond belief. As always, we chose to drink the paired wines and had the privilege of tasting some superb well matched wines with our unusual meal.

I have been to countless 2 and 3 star restaurants, but I keep coming back to Essigbrätlein and Etxebarri because they continue to impress me every time.  For me the best places are about brilliant ideas, talent, simplicity, hard work, honesty, service and fair prices. Essigbrätlein excels on every front - and several months later I still remember exactly how some dishes tasted.   In particular the ""cucumber and tomato"" dish stands out. I don't know how it's possible to take so simple ingredients and turn them into such an amazing experience. But Essingbrätlein knows and I can't recommend this place enough.

2024-02-18,Jurica H,"A very nice Saturday afternoon, for sure. Our meeting with this wonderful restaurant happened yesterday, Saturday, February 17, 2024. It was lunch as part of our Valentine's Day, since due to work we couldn't go over the week when Valentine's Day was. I found out about the restaurant, as well as everything else that is offered at the KORAK family estate, while researching the Internet. I wanted to take my love to a beautiful place and I chose KORAK. I didn't make a mistake. And my love was very satisfied and happy. The restaurant has a Michelin star, so I thought they must be great. And they were.   The restaurant is located on one of the hills of the Plješevica and offers a beautiful view of the surroundings. It is also the wine-growing region of Croatia with fine wines. I reserved a five-course menu. You can also reserve eight dishes menu, but these five were quite enough for the two of us. I must mention that you don't know what you ordered in those five courses, you just reserve the menu and everything that follows is a surprise. I think this is very interesting. The food from start to finish was phenomenal, imaginative, very tasty and beautifully arranged and served on plates. There was everything on our menu, from homemade cheese, homemade prosciutto, homemade butter in beeswax, homemade bread that is made in a special way, all the way to dishes like tortellini in a fine sauce with grated black truffle (which the staff grates in front of you). , lamb brisket with chickpeas, beautifully prepared squab with home-made grated horseradish and steamed shallots with plums, and a delicious even slightly salty caramel ice cream with toppings.....and some other interesting elements of our menu.  Everything was very tasty, beautiful to see and imaginative. For the first time in our life, my love and I ate sguab and it was nice and tasty, in fact we were positively surprised. The staff told us that they change the menu all the time, so if we come back a few more times, and we might from what we've seen, we'll eat some other food. Very interesting.   I have to praise the staff as well. They were very professional, polite and smiling, which is very important for a restaurant of this type. Each plate they brought us, that is, each course, was presented to us in an excellent way. They described to us what we were eating, how each element of the meal was prepared, with what technique, etc. Also their drinks that we drank, which was Chardonnay white wine and, at the very beginning, home-made apple cognac we also liked the staff gave information about where they came from, how everything was done, etc.   In the end, my recommendation if you are looking for a very nice place with great food and drinks. For the chef Mr. Korak and his staff all the praises and may they continue at the same pace. Maybe another Michelin star will come soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r938778181-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,5,en
2023-10-27,Wies v,"We absolutely loved our visit to the Korak family winery and restaurant! We started our visit in the afternoon with a wine tasting of 5 of their wines with a very nice snack platter and a visit to their cellar. After that, we walked around in the small village for a bit before starting our dinner. We went for 5 courses with 1 Korak wine pairing and 1 regional wine pairing. The food was original and local and very nice and the host and staff were very friendly and professional. The vineyard and restaurant are family owned and the family still runs both - the daughter of the family was the host, one of the sons is the chef, the grandma still helps in the kitchen and the father & another son run the winery. The restaurant is only 45 mins away from Zagreb and we stayed in a very nice guesthouse at 5 mins walking distance (Rezekov) to be able to fully enjoy the wine and getting home safely :) Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r923150396-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,5,en

The food experience is not  memorable, out of 5 dishes, two were good, mostly the pigeon, the others 3 really basic.   Instead, wines are are tasty and lovely.

2023-06-17,Maja C,"This place is out of ordinary and deserves to be spotlighted because of the family who runs the place, because of the food (organic, authentic, local..) because of the enviroment and the location that is breathtaking. One important thing is that this restaurant has almost zero food waste policy. We took 8 sequence meals and it was 3hrs of taste rapsody and enjoying the food and the story of each plate. The chef created such a crazy combination of tastes but still remained authentic to traditional cousine. The dinner was really really abondant and we were full by the desert. Nex time I will go slowly with the bread but since it was the best bread in the entire world I am not sure if one can avoid eating it. Each meal was accompanied by a story and a glass of wine, selected to match the meal. We ended up buying 4 bottles as the wine was amazing, so tasty, rich and easy to drink (yes, after 8 glassis of wine we were slightly drunk, but happy).

2023-02-05,Maurizio G,"""Korak"" needs to decide what they want to be. A star restaurant or a wine-tasting bar! If they want to be a ""star"" restaurant: the food is delicious, almost there. They can work on service a bit more. The interior decorations and furniture are very nice. Need to work on the lights. But most important you can not have a group of way too loud guests in a ""star"" restaurant because everybody else is suffering.  If they want to be a wine-tasting bar they have it all. Nice wines, great views, and professional staff. They just need to drop a tasting menu and prepare a few local dishes that would work perfectly with wine tasting.  Once someone at ""Korak"" decides what they want to be I honestly believe that will be a great place to visit. The message they are sending out now just doesn't reflect reality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r877561396-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,3,en

The hosts were friendly and accommodating.  The charcuterie plate was loaded up with a variety of delicious meets, cheeses, breads, butter, spreads etc.  There was lots there to enjoy and all of it either home-made or artisanal.  I'm not a big fan of Croatian wines.  They had a decent Syrah and Sauv Blanc.  A sparkling pinot noir and chardonnay (I've never had sparkling chardonnay before) and another one that I can't recall.

2021-04-17,Nikola,"I've created a TripAdvisor account, just so I can tell everyone how mind-blowing my experience in this restaurant was. I've had very high expectations coming in, but the whole experience completely blew me away.  Eating at Kokrak's is just that, experience, you simply cannot compare it to going to a regular restaurant, it is on a par with what you'd expect of an extremely good fine-dining restaurant :)  Every dish out of an 8-course menu was, without any exaggeration, the best thing I've eaten. If I had to pick the best, I'd have to settle for 2, the smoked trout  (because I *really* don't like eating fish, and this was amazing)  and Tortellini (because they are my favorite dish,  ever since my childhood and these were best I've eaten. Ever. By far 😁)  I've been enjoying Korak's wines for some time now, and their Pinot  Noir is one of my favorite wines, so awesome wines, paired with mind-blowing food, in modern yet homey abience is the experience I'll definitely remember for the rest of my life :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r786694517-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,5,en

The quality and creativity of the food was good BUT compared to other slow food restaurants (of which some of them have michelin stars) who offer impeccable service, great variety of wines (not from own cellar) and comparable food but on a different level - this is really a rip-off!   We were sitting in a ""hallway"" - the wines didn't arrive together with the food,  we were served by 3 different people of which only one knew what she was doing -  and at the end - we were asked to pay at the bar (like it's a fast food) and didn't get a check, because something was out of order. Overall, the price for two people with Korak wine pairing was more than 2.000kn - I'm not sensing a bright future for them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r785449981-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,2,en

If our bill would have been halved  ( half price ) I would enthusiastically recommend it the visit.

2024-09-27,Fab',"Very unique approach where all tables are served at the same time, where all comes from the local area, where the entrées is an abundance of dishes all executed to the millimeter and where the guests are invited to be active and find out what are they tasting.  The view to the kitchen shows that everything is being tested before is is sent out; this is a very impressive machinery and the amount of work produced in the kitchen is herculean.  Note on the bread, it is home-made too and in such a nice way that it has been years since eating such bread, and it will be years till the next one.  This is a moment suspended away from time in a very intimate room. The dinner takes easily 4 hours: we come here for taking time and taking things slow. Due to the nature of the fact that all is prepared on the spot and the room is served entirely at the same time, there can be some moments that are a bit long.  It is worth noting that none of the tables ordered any alcohol; the cuisine is self sufficient and no pairing is required. Also, there are so many dishes that if you had to take a glass even on every other dish only, one wouldn’t be able to get full tasting capabilities by the end of it.  It is also a very unique approach that there is no vertical management, and it shows on how peaceful the team is. Each team member is handpicked to be sure they fit in this unique management style, and talking with them is already a travel by itself.  It is a success all throughout and it deserves more than 1 star; maybe 1.5 star. The washroom is maybe the only thing that is not fully on par with the rest of the establishment.  Booking in advance recommended, table near the windows and the cliff will mainly make sense for lunch.

2024-08-15,Urszula S,"The views are beautiful and the food is nice and innovative, but I expect more from a Michelin star restaurant. Food - interesting and unusual taste combinations, some very tasty, but no “wow-moments “. Instead there were a few dishes I definitely disliked. The chef should perhaps focus on balancing/perfecting selected dishes, rather than producing a multitude of tastes. Far too much sour (and I mean REALLY sour) flavours for my taste. Also, two chicken main dishes in a set menu is not really ok. In general, except for the multitude of colourful starters, it felt quite cheap, especially for the prices they are charging. The strongest point for me was the extensive use of fresh herbs/flowers from their own garden in every dish. It did elevate the taste and overall experience. Drinks - generally very good wines, well matched with the dishes. A very tasty and original aperitif of the house. Nice selection of digestives. For environmental reasons they use their own filtered tap water, which is ok (although the taste was not great). What is not ok is to charge for it as if it was an exclusive bottled water. Service - very friendly and attentive, but lacking the smooth excellence you expect in a star restaurant. Three waitresses for the whole dining room (including the sommelier) is not really enough and the service was sometimes delayed, or not synchronised. Their English was also not really fluent. The explanation/presentation of dishes was much more limited than in other star restaurants. Setting - except for the nice view, the place really lacks some style and refinement. The decor gives a cosy, but cheap impression. The napkins looked and felt like they were my grandma’s age and they were not even nicely ironed. You are expected to use the same cutlery for multiple dishes. The tables outside would fit better in a roadside cafe and the walk to the entrance makes you wonder if you’re entering someone’s (not very tidy) backyard. It is not even lit in the evening - don’t forget your flashlight! To sum up - Aponem is a nice restaurant and definitely worth a visit if you are a foodie and don’t care much about prices. It is definitely overpriced for what is delivered and it definitely doesn’t live up to a Michelin star experience. If you want a real star experience, drive around 15-20 minutes towards the coast and restaurant De Lauzun - that is a star restaurant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r965037627-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html,3,en

This time we started with a cocktail that Gaby created based on a few ideas of things we like, and it was a sign of the many more good things to come from the Aponem team.

Piquancy was presented with lime fragrance, creamy sauces were carefully balanced with light spice. I don't know what I liked more: the rocks or the food.

2018-11-25,Erica T,"Well it looks like I will have the honour of being the 2nd Brit to review this jewel. To be honest I cant really improve on the first review, which accurately describes our experience. We did book in advance and were lucky to be given the last table available for the day, in the winter months when the veranda dinning area is unavailable the internal restaurant is limited to only 7 tables. When presented with the menu we were a little confused to read : menu of 38 euros, menu of 55 euros, no idea or description of what was on each menu. This was later explained by the charming staff, and we were given the impression that all we had to do was sit back relax and enjoy the culinary experience, which we did.  The wine list is extensive and slightly confusing as we had no idea what we were going to eat, so unsure what the best wine to go with it was, we just went with the sommeliers recommendation, which proved to be excellent. Sadly I had to come back to England, but I know my family plans to revisit the Aponem  in December, I am jealous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r635610383-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html,5,en
2018-09-20,RonaysRevenge,"Well it looks like I have the distinction, nay honour, of being the 1st Brit to review this magnificently located jewel. Fortune had smiled upon us this Monday for having discovered all other restaurants were shut we were blessed to be offered the last two remaining covers at this recently under-a-new-team opened gem of a place. From the go this tiny shrine to the gods of gourmand presented impeccable service and charm, the front of house welcoming and attentive - as well as fluent in spoken English which we found essential when the various plates were explained, my grasp of French sadly rusty. From the menu of two choices (the accompanying wine suggestions sadly not taken due to chauffeuring duties) we sensibly opted for the full Aponem. What followed was a succession of impeccable plates of creativity, beautifully executed and cooked with great passion and love. Organic ingredients sourced from either the region or their own garden had been prepared to maximise flavour and the presentational skills displayed showed the young team have all learnt their craft from the best and will no doubt make this a rising star to be watched very carefully.  We will be revisiting Aponem again very soon - next time I'll make sure I'm not driving so as to include the accompanying wine reccomendations.  Merci a tous au restaurant et Bonne Chance!

2022-07-25,Lollo A,"I explain the reason for my vote: I am a fan of good cooking, I like to cook as a hobby, I love to try starred or otherwise good restaurants, especially to try unusual dishes, preparation methods that I would not be able to reproduce at home, inventiveness applied to cooking... in short, to amaze myself. I expect this especially if I am talking about a restaurant with three Michelin stars. The first impression on arriving at Il Pescatore is excellent, an evocative location, a very friendly welcome from all the staff in the dining room (which will prove to be the only voice that lives up to the restaurant's name throughout the meal), and great attention to detail. As I usually do in this type of venue, I chose the tasting menu to be taken on a journey chosen by the kitchen, on their signature dishes. The menu is boring, banal, with dishes that in most cases I have already seen and re-seen. There is never a flicker, a thrill, an emotion in either the presentation or the flavours. It is a restaurant that lives on the glories of the past and on self-aggrandisement (dishes conspicuously signed with the restaurant's name), offering cuisine that is not traditional, but old. I conclude by saying that one of the courses was wrong, fish with completely the wrong cooking. I point this out and the reaction is certainly very composed and polite, I am offered a new course. The question is, can such an incident happen in a restaurant of this level? For me not. I also think that the episode should be taken into account when presenting the bill, which given the price (the one that is STELLAR), cannot have flaws in the meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1238427-d799437-r849746812-Ristorante_dal_Pescatore_Santini-Canneto_sull_Oglio_Province_of_Mantua_Lombardy.html,2,en

2018-07-20,MMSCPSYH,"We were delayed en route and arrived at the restaurant over an hour after our appointed time, just before the last order deadline of 2pm. We had previously been refused entry at another Michelin-rated restaurant in Italy at 1.55pm, and so felt anxious about timing when we arrived. Sommelier Alberto Santini instantly soothed us by explaining there was no rush at all. We then had a wonderful meal with every dish executed perfectly. Antonio Sanitini stopped by at our table to chat several times. We ended our meal at 4.30pm (feeling guilty about the late timing) but were escorted out very graciously by Antonio, who waited patiently while we sorted out our GPS before pointing us in the right direction.

2018-05-03,sfoeuroflyer,"It is difficult to decide which of Dal Pescatore's virtues to spotlight first:  the conception of the dishes, the execution, the welcome from the family, the service, the wine list, the warmth of the rooms.  Suffice to say there is perfection in every detail.  I think it starts with the fact that this is a family restaurant:  Nadia and her son, Giovanni, in the kitchen; Antonio and the younger son, Alberto, in the dining rooms.  There is a gentleness to Nadia that emerges immediately as you talk with her, and that is expressed in her food.  There is no artifice in what she and Giovanni prepare.  Each dish is pure, elegant, and refined.  Hard to name a favorite, but a few that spring to mind:  the pumpkin tortelli (a signature dish that is both subtle and complex in its perfect balance of flavors), the long cooked beef shoulder with Nebbilo sauce, the lobster terrine with caviar, grilled eel.  Antonio and Alberto run the dining room with warmth and professionalism.  In some ways, each one of the dining rooms have a Japanese flavor to them, as each has an intimate view on at least one wall of the garden.  Wine list is fabulous.  The only downside is that the restaurant is close to nowhere.

2016-09-19,Ayn R,"I am very fortunate to have a close family friend that happens to be Milanese and happens to be into good food.  I would have never found or known about this place otherwise.  He mentioned to me that we would be dining in the country side and to dress more towards elegante than what I had on at that time jeans.   Being an American and living in the mid-west, fancy in the countryside is kind of an oxymoron.    It took a little over an hour to get there from Milan and it is literally in the middle of nowhere as in farmland.  The building was probably a small house at some point and when waiters in black tie greeted us, it was a mind twist.  A fabulous one, as I started to feel I was about to experience something I may have only seen in a foreign film.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon an we started out with a glass of spumante on the veranda.  The grounds to this place are serene and lovely.  Part of the experience.  We ordered one of the 3 tasting meals.  Each dish was gorgeous in its presentation and delicious beyond words.  I don't call myself a foodie or a wine connoisseur though I am always in pursuit of both.  I am though an artist and a stimulation junkie and I judge based upon those qualities.  I like to be surprised in the sense that I think I am going to be tasting this but it turns out to be that.    These dishes and the spumante met those ideals.  Without doubt, this was the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant.  Now I would like to mention the service.  That too beat everything I had experienced up to this point.  Everything was beyond measure and perfectly timed!    If you are traveling to Italy, especially if you are somewhere between Milan and Venice, I highly recommend this place.  We do have this kind of experience in the US.

After watching the episode featuring ANA ROS, she was adamant: “Yes, let’s go to Slovenia!”   Unfortunately, we couldn’t secure a reservation at the restaurant, so we opted to stay in the heart of Kobarid. From the moment we arrived, we felt incredibly welcomed. It was like visiting family—warm and inviting, a feeling you never want to leave behind. The selection of aperitifs was outstanding, with thoughtfully crafted cocktails and non-alcoholic options made by the Hisa Franko team, along with local beers and Slovenian wines.  We dined in a cozy red room adorned with paintings, kombucha jars, and lovely carpets. It felt just like being in our own living room. The food was absolutely incredible, and the funky wine we tried was the best my wife and I have ever tasted. A huge thank you to Manuel, Tylen, Alejandro, and the rest of the team who made our evening so memorable.  At the end of our meal, we had the opportunity to tour the kitchen, guided by the wonderful Lisa, who shared insights about its layout and operations. We were also taken to the wine and cheese cellar—what a treat! They age their own cheeses there.  I can’t express enough gratitude to the entire Hisa Franko team.

There was a stone in my food that cracked my tooth.  We put the stone and my piece of tooth on a napkin which they took to the kitchen, came back, verified that it was a stone and said, ""sorry.""  I guess to me, for a $600+ meal, that wasn't good enough.  So, as you wade through the grass sandwiches and ""unifying with nature"" beware that it is possible that their preparation did not purge these delicacies from the rocks that also come in nature.

2024-08-28,Lopat,"As is probably the case for the vast majority of guests, I myself had very high expectations for this place which the entire team not only fulfilled, but also greatly exceeded. The plates are thought out and designed to the smallest of detail. I was simply amazed by the taste from course to course (""I was blown away by the salad and the fruit praline: how can you achieve such a taste with raw food?"") .The courses follow each other in a well-thought-out order, where it seems that each plate prepares you for the next one and at the same time, together they form a story. Not only that prestigious ingredients (trout, venison, oysters) shine in this story but sublime are also humble barley, polenta, carrots, potatoes, sour cream. A tribute to the authentic Slovenian home cooking cannot be overlooked here, and as a Slovenian guest I am extremely grateful for it.   Not only the food is superb, but also the service: I don't know if I ever felt so welcomed, relaxed, anywhere.   I thought this dinner would be a once in a lifetime experience, but now I can't wait to come back.

The freshness of the herbs, leaves, fruits, and vegetables made them the star of the meal. Such great combinations and delicious flavor. The river trout was local and just seemed to make sense in this beautiful mountain setting. The carrot ice cream was a game changer and I was searching for recipes right after we left the restaurant.  I’m not a fan of game meats and did not enjoy the roebuck at all, but each and every bite of the other 15 courses was a special once in a lifetime experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r956070509-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html,5,en
2024-06-05,rdear60878,"Dinner in a three-star Michelin restaurant doesn't happen very often to most of us. So I was very curious to have this experience. It is a tasting menu with many courses. I loved some of them (the potato, for example; you'll never feel the same way about potatoes again!). But several were not to my taste. What was truly extraordinary, however, was the amazing attention from the staff and the feeling that the presentation, explanation and removal of every course was totally choreographed.

2024-03-31,dr_aaltonen,"There is a nice lounge with fireplace where aperitif is served. Dinner room is next to it. Food was obviously very good. There were few misses too, which were little unexpected. Dining took too long time. I entered to the restaurant 19:15 and left it (not having extra cheese, coffee or digestive) at 23:30. Service was professional and friendly. Wine pouring was very small, especially when all wines were meant for multiple dishes. Some wines were poured more, but it didn’t leave a good feeling. 17 courses including amuse bouche, if you can call it that, size of all the portions was more or less the same throughout the dinner: 1. Caviar, etc. Spicy, good, too big for one bite, impossible to cut with spoon provided 2. Crab, etc. Good size, good taste 3. Plant sandwich. Again two big for one bite, difficult to cut by teeth into two 4. Donut with smoked roe. Very good! 5. Potato with a salty crest. Absolutely awful! Crest was unbelievable salty. Potato was potato 6. Spring harvest. Okay, nothing special 7. Peas. Excellent! 8. Taglioni. Too salty again!  9. Trout. Good 10. Capperletti. Very good! 11. Barley. Some of it was raw, not good 12. Lamb pelmeni. Spicy, good 13. Meat on two pieces. Good, although difficult to cut ingredients with spoon and fork 14. Carrot ice-cream to clear palate. A bit strange but not bad 15. Sweet potato dumpling. Very sweet, more kind of a cheese portion 16. One strawberry. Well, strawberry, not very good one 17. Spicy pumpkin. Candy Optional cheese was offered after the dessert…?!  Classy wine pairing: 1. Champagne, Pierre Paillard Les Parcelles Bouzy Grand Cru. Very small pouring, too mineral for my taste 2. Slovenian white, Marlon Batic Vipava 2021. Very good, small portion, refilled 3. Slovenian white, Hedele Malvazija Coce 2020. Good! 4. Vonograd trilogia, white. Good 5. Slovenian chardonney. Good 6. Slovenian red, Brutus, 90% merlot. Goo, but again nor enough 7.

The courses makes you feel like you are on a relaxed walk in the woods, after rain. It calms your heart but surprises your palate. A special and amazing experience. Every course is special, beautifully presented. The staff is so nice and polite. I also adored the non alcoholic menu within every course comes a different drink.

2023-10-20,Marie5466,"Where do you begin when everything is so appetizing, well put together, tantalizing, unexpected, and flavorsome? When more than your sense of taste, is involved and you get a balanced experience between sight, touch, smell, and feel.  An incredible dance for the palate.  First, they start with a heavy white bowl filled with wonderful, freshly picked, damp forest moss and ask you to feel it and smell it as a connection back to nature, a grounding to the present, which is what their menu represents.  A bond, an association with the richness of nature’s many tastes, textures, colors, smells, and more.  A connection to the local area, to now.  From the Fifty Shades of Life menu, a wink to Ana Roš and Hiša Franko Restaurant turning 50!  Hoping for many more based on my experience here.   In awe of each dish (there were 18 of them – including the one you bring home), I kept wondering where such unfathomable creativity comes from.  What kind of genius dreams-up stuff like that?   Fig leaf granita mixed with puffed buckwheat?  Beeswax fondue?  Shiso leaf with mescal infused melon?  Fig leaf kombucha tea.   The staff flowed through the tables, the outside patio, and all the rooms effortlessly and seamlessly.  Whatever they promised, they never forgot to do.  For example, they knew where I came from and one of their chef comes from the same part of Canada so at the end of the meal (at which point I had forgotten they would connect us) we met and it turns out he came from a mere 20km from where I do.  Small world.  Staff seems to be from many places, our server was from Colorado, USA, that chef from Québec, Canada, and many more.  There was no stuffy orchestration even though the coordination was flawless.  Even if you can’t or don’t want to drink alcohol, they have wonderful selections.  I tried two of their Kombucha teas and both were marvelous, especially the fig leaf one (excellent and super refreshing, almost like a palate cleanser between courses).  It’s definitely not only about the presentation, the food, and the ambiance.  What I also appreciated was just how connected the staff were with one another.  Also their obvious love of the food.  No matter how obscure a question was, they had an answer.  I didn’t, for example, know what a lacto-fermented tomato water was (PS.  It has nothing to do with milk).  Once it was described to me, it helped me better understand the food I was served.  So it is not only a tasting experience, but also a learning one.    I had a bit of a fear of coming to my first Michelin restaurant because I thought it would be a stodgy, pretentious place.  As it turned out, everyone was very approachable, candid, polite, inquisitive, and fun, all the while attentive and professional.  I could go on, but I’ll let you go and enjoy a meal there.  I felt alive when I finished my meal despite the full stomach and the late hour.  The portions and pace of each serving were perfect so I never felt overloaded.  I would say, only one course wasn’t as good as all the others (too salty), the rest were all excellent and surprising.  Kudos to this amazing team who pulls this miracle night after night.  Thank you for the great experience.  When checking out, you receive a menu signed by Ana herself accompanied by a specially made candy to take home.  I am glad that my first Michelin experience was here.  It will be hard to surpass.    OF NOTE:  You cannot add a tip to your credit card bill so bring some cash if you want to tip.

2023-08-16,David H,"I am not sure, where to start. Having a reservation for about 9 months, it was too long of a wait :) but worth it. We have booked the dine and stay option and I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting Hisa (the breakfast is totally worth it :D ) Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Svetlana, shown to our room and went for a late lunch. Tilen recommended a fantastic local bubbly, and it went together just excellently with the local cheeses on offer. The setting of Hisa is unique, so we basked in a summer sun, sipped on the bubbles in the blooming garden and chilled. Dinner: 17 courses, spanning across 3-4 hours, plus an option for a cheese board, go for it. Fantastic selection of wines at very reasonable prices. Having a really bad experience from a 1star restaurant in Berlin recently, our worries faded away immediately after the opener and we just felt great, going on a culinary journey on and on. Is 17 dishes little or too much? Just right I would say, in Hisa´s case. Staff: WONDERFUL. We had so much fun, as Maria, being from US, suddenly spoke to us in Czech the evening took a different spin, it was great. The sommelier, young lady, was spot on. We did not opt for the wine pairing, but went instead for a superb 2008 blanc de blancs grand cru, couple glasses of wonderful reds and finished it off with an amazing Tokai.   This was an experience worth waiting for and if we ever have a chance to visit again, we won´t hesitate. Greatest thanks to Tilen, Svetlana, Maria and rest of the staff. You are guys doing a fantastic job and you can be proud of it. Hope to see you soon again.

Unfortunately the meal… maybe it was the mussel or maybe it was the timothy hay crusted potato or something else, …gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill for the following 24 hours.  Not a pleasant experience on your vacation!  There was no other possible source than the meal at Hisa Franko.  It was not a flu virus.  To add insult to injury when I indicated to Hisa Franko what had happened they were not apologetic nor would they refund the cost of my meal.  While I understand that mistakes can happen I cannot understand their staunch denial that I could get sick from their meal.  As I said before, there was no other possible source.  Perhaps they need to understand that the customer’s experience is not all about the story of the preparation of the food but also how the customer feels once they leave the restaurant.

The two stars are setting expectation level to the top. The check in was very smooth and professional. We were invited for aperetifs before dinner, but this turned out that we were to order drinks from their menu. The set up outdoors was though very nice.  The restaurant venue is classy and stylish. The service was overwhelming. The food (tasting menu) was extensive and very nicely presented. Sadly the tastes were often a bit mild and basically all food was eaten with your fingers. The wine package of local wines was just ok, nothing really special.   Chef Ana Ros visited the tables many time what was really nice.  Breakfast was as a whole a nice experience.

The potato was only mildly warm, and the butter was very cold as to not melt on the potato, so not capturing the whole favor of the dish.

Having worked in the past in the food service industry, I found it is nice to be recognized by upper management.

Whilst remarkably inventive and beautifully plated some of dishes did miss the mark. The Iberico ham style tuna belly was challenging and the seafood based desserts didn’t really work.

Everything is delicious, using excellent products, superbly presented. It is pretty much all from the sea, even the butter, cheese and desserts. Despite that, the food is very varied. Although I found the sea desserts less convincing. In the accompanying Nec Plus Ultra option, all the wines were very good, generously served. More or less half Jerez ones, and half more classic from Spain and France.    Outstanding service, and very nice dining room. No private car park, but ample public spaces are available. It is hugely expensive, but it is fair value.   On the other hand, one could criticize the cold temperatures: freezing cold dining room, serving the wines too cool to allow the their real quality to come through (but that is the custom in the area), and the cold dishes are really too cold (like the wines, preventing the taste to develop). Also the reception room where you are first served some tapas is rather unpleasant, a boring and uncomfortable waiting room. Still, all that does not detract from the great overall experience.

2022-09-01,Greenpen,"I ate here by myself on July 20th 2022, the cost was £337 for the standard tasting menu and accompanying sherry wines.      Their lunch is very early, I was the second sitting at 13.15, not very Spanish at all, but the meal will take several hours so you'll still finish late.    The first few small starters are served in a lounge within the property but away from the main dining room; time to relax and prepare or if like me, cool down after a brisk walk from my hotel!     You get  a couple of wines with these four dishes.     You are then accompanied into the restaurant which is in an old mill and given a brief tour and a charcoal grilled sardine on the way to your table.     Alas, at low tide there is a bit of a smell from the estuary but this does not seem to pervade the actual dining area.  I do not want to comment on all the dishes; you will like some more than others but they are all interesting.   I only left one which was called Pieles  lacticas  or milky skins.    This seemed to be fish skin imitating the skin on a rice pudding!    Not my cup of tea at all!   Everything else was interesting as a food experience but I do ask myself why?    Camembert cheese is delicious so why would you want to make it from tuna testes; Iberian ham is wonderful so why serve one created from fish?    It's an experience rather than a meal.     I liked the sherries served in the wine pairing except for one, that was substituted for another I had previously had and enjoyed.    Perhaps there should have been an alternative new wine substituted?  Service was excellent from start to finish.  Would I go again?   No.   Did I enjoy the experience?   Yes.   Did I like the food?   Generally yes and they succeeded in producing a uniformly high calibre tasting menu which is very difficult to do.  Favourite course?    A jellyfish concoction served on a glass jellyfish globe as one of the after dinner morsels.    Tasty with a mild stinging after effect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r857860691-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,5,en
2022-07-30,Kendall K,"I love how all Michelin’s are in plane site, in locations that you’ve passed multiple times and didn’t think twice about it. Aponiente is beautiful, an old mill turned restaurant the chef did an great job transforming this place to what we see today. The decor is perfectly inline with the theme of the sea.   There is no other fine dining establishment I’ve been to that compares to this! Prior to being seated at your table you’ll have a seat in a comfortable waiting area where you’ll indulge in some of the best appetizers you’ll nibble on. From there you’ll go on a small tour of the restaurant/kitchen prior to being seated; you can see all of the chefs hard at work.   The main dinning area is well lit, with cool drop ceilings and a view of the kitchen. The waiters are all in sync and well prepared when serving you the multiple main course meals throughout your dinning experience. The food is down right delicious and has so many amazing flavors. The fact that none of the dishes had any, beef, pork and chicken was impressive; it was all from the sea and magnificent. Another amazing thing was how much of the sea was used to make the delightful food, this restaurant is all about sustainability and things that would typically be thrown out from a fish were repurposed and used in the dishes.   I highly recommend going to Aponiente if your ever in El Puerto de Santa Maria. You won’t be disappointed, worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r850933327-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html,5,en

After eating the whole menu including 3 of their breads, we were still left hungry.  The service is very rushed and on top of that it seems that they literally have to refill your wine glass 20 times per bottle. They will come to your table atleast 20 times to pour like 1-2cl of wine. Enough for a sip or two and then they need to re-fill again...   The atmosphere is too noisy. There is simply too many tables for the space, which ruins the experience for many.  But why does a 3 star restaurant not have a wine pairing? Has sherry pairings instead? Dont you have a sommelier?

Location bluntly odd - on an old abandoned industrial site next to the train station, not where you expect to find culinary heaven. .building actually an old water mill - driven by tidal movements. Apperativos  taken in an ante area before the main restaurant.  Moving to the restaurant a mini tour was given of the old building. Decoration very tasteful and well done. Food simply exquisite with each plate surpassing the previous. Vast majority of the plates based on local sea produce. Each well presented and incredibly tasty. Service impecable - discreet and informed.  As I was solo, I took the wine tasting option. Whilst the individual wines were great, the majority were Jerez based in one way or another and, in my opinion simply didn’t match with the food dishes - they didn’t compliment or contrast, they simply were. This was the only slight disappointment of the evening, especially given other wine tasting experiences which have gone phenomenal with the food, and I explained this to the sommelier.

The setting is unique and the structure of the restaurant is lovely.   We quite enjoyed our appetizers in the first building before going to the dining room. We were seated at a table for 8 but there was only the 2 of us...very strange!  All the tables were large with white table cloths that just looked uninviting and cold.  The tables were far apart and the atmosphere truly lacked intimacy...candles, flowers etc would have been nice. The food was good, but I think the presentations and theatrics of the staff was just a bit over the top.   Some one mentioned feeling rushed.  I agree.  There was not much down time between courses to the point the ""wine server"" kept removing my unfinished glasses of wine/sherry.

We enjoyed the history, the stories about the food, the educational bits, the exceptional service and most of all the food of course.   And yes, it’s really expensive for a Cadiz where you can often have an amazing dinner including a drink for 10-15 euros per person. This makes it challenging as the comparison is so completely out of balance. In London a good dinner is often 100 pounds per person and an exceptional 200 pounds which makes Aponiente great value.

Only around 17 diners so atmosphere not quite right.  Apparently it is packed at the weekend with around 40 diners per service.  Whilst some dishes taste like meat, everything is sea food of some kind.   The plates used were great works of imagination - occasional laugh out loud stuff.   All the matching wines were sherries (maybe one of the 11 wasn’t). I loved them.   The bill was steep but less than I feared. There were few of the add ons one is often stuck with.  €650 for 2 including plentiful booze.  It felt like value for money.   A very special evening.

Afterwards there was a guided tour of the restaurant and in addition to the dining facilities, reference was also made to the company Moessmer, which owns the Villa. Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression. The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table. But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain. Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures.

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit. In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved. Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen. The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques. We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet.

A team and excellent service as well as the quality of the typical products of the area, as well as the technique and research of each dish on the tasting menu, justify both the €300 per person, in addition to the wines, and the three stars awarded to the master Norbert Niederkofler , the only chef in the world to obtain them when opening a new restaurant.

2023-12-27,RobertoM,"In fact, it is precisely curiosity that inexorably leads me to persevere with these experiences, albeit with some perplexity each time. Questions I will never have answers to. Is it worth a long journey and an extremely expensive expense to ""eat""? Common sense and practical reason would say no! ! Imagination and curiosity would answer yes! If this were not the case there would be nothing beautiful, artistic, refined or aesthetic! I personally would just like the certainty that this is there and not a tested and pre-packaged mechanism. After this humble and personal general consideration of mine, in detail the house is very welcoming, perhaps the road to reach it is a little dark but it is a completely insignificant detail, the welcome is extremely professional, God forbid, but not taken for granted, the service in the youth room, polite and smiling, young and friendly sommelier. The menu satisfied us in terms of taste and presentation, perhaps I realize that the more you have experiences like this the more you have expectations, often senseless! It is always pleasant to have contact with the chef who in this case tells you the story, the choices and objectives, the projects, certainly following a script for each guest but it seems sincere and authentic. The route is therefore not just gastronomic, making the evening special and unique!

Entering this ancient Villa not to watch but to be part of the show: warm and refined welcome, sublime aperitifs served in a small lounge in front of the lit fireplace, with the walls covered in warm loden as well as the armchairs and clothing of the staff room. Sitting at the counter overlooking the kitchen, it was like being on stage and enjoying the work of the main performers: cooks, waiters and the patron. Norbert, as a grand master, introduced us to the house with its history and its new destination. We listened to the philosophy of Cook the mountain, nourished our eyes by observing the mastery of the young people bent over the counters in the preparation of masterpieces, delighted our palates with genuine albeit elaborate flavours, the result of a lot of work, a lot of dedication.

2023-09-26,Albi23,"When this exceptional chef closed his restaurant in San Cassiano, in my opinion (and not only in my opinion) one of the best in the world, I really hoped he would reopen soon in another place. And so, without much publicity, here is this beautiful place in Brunico, created by renovating a villa a few meters from the centre, where the chef has designed everything to measure to be perfectly organized and to best accommodate the privileged guests who manage to book. The welcome is wonderful, in a lounge where you can drink a glass of champagne and taste the first delicacies of a dinner that will prove sublime. It takes us further to the table, for us a comfortable counter overlooking the kitchen, where throughout the evening we will see the painstaking work of a young team, who prepare the dishes with precision and attention as if they were working in an operating theatre. A journey begins that favors local raw materials, including the best butter we have tasted in my life, vegetables from the garden, fish and meat where you can feel the freshness, quality and ability to invent and prepare excellent dishes. A few photos will show the delicacies we ate. Very high quality wines in a well-stocked cellar. Impeccable service. We finish dinner in the initial lounge with a herbal tea and a small pastry.

2022-10-10,MrsMardy,"I want to begin by giving a shout out to the two VERY hard woking servers at this restaurant.  They were fantastic.  They were also put in a very bad position the evening we were there.  We arrived at 7:30 per the request of the restaurant.  We left at midnight.  They offered a vegetarian menu.  My husband chose the regular menu.  The starters, all the same typical of France, were not vegetarian (which is OK for me), and they were OK. Fish, foie gras, etc.  But here is the disappointing part: next course for me: one mushroom, sliced in pieces and with a mushroom consommé.  My husband: squid noodles, cooked right there in front of us, pretty good.  Next course: Me: one...one small ravioli called an original ""French minestrone""-that was undercooked in a cold cabbage broth that tasted like nothing else but cabbage.  Now we are at 10:30pm in the evening.   The bread was dry and had been cut way before the meal.  My husband had pigeon, again, OK.  The rest?  I don't even remember. Again: the two servers, a young man and a young woman, were so kind and nice, got us a taxi (at midnight)...but what the heck?  Surely you can do better than this!  Don't offer a vegetarian menu if you can't support it.  I'm not a true vegetarian, but I can only imagine how upset I would be if I was...and really, over four hours for this food was not acceptable. It's not an easy restaurant to get to and expensive cab ride-40 E each way).

2019-04-14,Chris A,"We were recommended Le Prince Noir as we only had a night to stay near Bordeaux and wanted something special. It was certainly different! Having eaten at a number of Michelin star restaurants across the world, this one stood out for all the wrong reasons.  We booked for 8pm but arrived 15 minutes early to have a drink, to find the doors closed. It was cold evening, but the staff made us wait outside until 8pm, along with the other couple who had booked that evening. Not exactly a warm welcome!!  We chose the 6-course tasting menu which can be best described as ‘good in parts’. The dishes were experimental. Some were delicious (the Octopus) and some were really not pleasant at all (the white asparagus). There was no meat course, as this had been replaced by the white asparagus. I ate more than my wife as I found her passing many elements of each dish to me...  Service was good, although one member of staff’s  approach to service was a little off-hand. The lad who served us spoke excellent English and was genuinely welcoming and he offered us either pigeon or cheese when he realised that we did not like the white asparagus.  Le Prince Noir clearly has a very good reputation locally, so perhaps we went on a bad night. We’ll never know, because we won’t be booking there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r666400576-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,2,en

2018-01-19,alanpcoleman,"What makes a good restaurant? The food obviously. Check. A real but warm welcome. Check. Excellent service that's attentive but not intrusive, friendly but not invasive, present but unseen. Check. A nice setting..... Hmmmmm a dark, rainy night doesn't help clarify that. An atmosphere you can relax in. Check.  Often a Michelin star can raise expectations. Having been deeply disappointed a few days before, I was a little nervous going here. I needn't have been. The staff were genuine, smiled and laughed, asked me about the food and wine, listening and taking my limited opinion into account. They were attentive but not overbearing. Eating alone doesn't bother me, I do however wonder if this doesn't sometimes put extra pressure on the staff. The atmosphere was lovely and the music excellent. They even turned up the volume a little for me... I was glad to be in the corner looking outwards as my back couldn't see others' reactions to my seated dancing.  The food was not perfect, some over salty, some a little bland. However these were parts of individual dishes and not the whole. I'd gladly return to the very smokey pork dish or the flavoursome scallops. The meal was extravagant in a good way, quality ingredients, well cooked, flavoursome, and at times adventurous. Sometimes too adventurous for my palate, but worthy of respect for trying, and mostly succeeding. The wine accompanying each dish working in harmony with the flavours on the plate. The food was a good 4*, the overall 5* easily coming from the staff, atmosphere, the 'feeling' engendered by the whole.  It's not an easy place to find (thank the GPS in the taxi), but it's worth the effort.

It is a short taxi ride outside of the heart of Bordeaux (across the river/estuary).  The setting is beautiful, and the restaurant a stunning mix of old (the castle) and new (the modern glass addition for the restaurant).  The food (we did the tasting menu) was exceptional, and the tables well-spaced; the restaurant was full, but we felt like we were eating alone.  One of our party is a vegetarian, which I had neglected to inform the restaurant of in advance (oops), and they did a wonderful job on no notice in creating a delicious and creative vegetarian meal.  The service was terrific, and the views of the surrounding grounds spectacular.

2017-07-26,moraira,"This restaurant is a one star Michelin place, and therefore serves good food, offers good service (and is expensive) . It lived up to the expectation  In the evening they just offer their two tasting menus, one of 5 courses and one of eight courses. We chose the 5 course menu and found even that was almost more than we could eat.  The setting is breath-taking - but you do need to have a table in the half of the restaurant with the picture windows. Ask to be seated there when you reserve. We had a view over the château, and as night fell, the château was floodlit  The staff are very good, friendly and polite, without being over friendly nor obsequious.. Personally I found their uniform a bit odd, the men in jeans and white trainers, and the girls in red dresses and white trainers  The menu changes weekly, so you are unlikely to have what we had, but take it from me, the flavour, quality and presentation of the food is outstanding.. We had a bottle of wine , rather than the selection of different wines you can have with each course. For a Michelin star restaurant, the wines are reasonably priced  It was a bit difficult to find, my GPS did not have the street given in their address. I put in a neighbouring street, and that got me to close enough, where we were able to pick up the street location signs for it. Once you get to it, there is ample parking, and you just walk into  the château via the marked signs  All in all a wonderful evening",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r505795555-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,5,en

I have been been fortunate enough to dine at many places where the food is delicious, but the staff and service is what sets Le Prince Noir in a class of its own.  There are a few points that stand out for me:  Decor: you walk in and there is beautiful artwork all around.  Everything in the restaurant has been chosen with care from the foosball table/bread cutting board, to the vintage Nintendo Game Machine in the corner (complete with sofas so you can actually play!)  Child-friendly:seeing my three year old and six year old go into the kitchen to order their meal with Vivien Durand is a sight I will remember for a long time.  The children's meal was delicious, healthy, and they ate every single bite.  I was so happy to see my children exposed to such a meticulously prepared meal. In between courses, my children were happily playing in the sculpture garden behind and no one even blinked an eye at children running around.  Servers:the servers were knowledgable, friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  They made great recommendations with the food and wine pairings.    The FOOD: Each bite was a delight and I was sad when I was too full to eat more.  Each dish was carefully and exquisitely prepared.

The ambiance is wonderful, perfect both for romantic dinners as well as larger celebrations. The restaurant's interior is a nice mix of modern and natural. The overall view is modern with lots of little details that I loved, like the big wooden table on which we were where we were served in stone like dishes with modern shapes. Each dish having its own identity. We were comfortably seated at our table and the waiter presented us with a smile the restaurant and prepared us for our 8 course discovery menu. I loved the team at the Prince Noir, it was a pleasure to be served by people who adore what they are doing.  We were guided by the restaurant's team into an explosion of tastes and aromas. All dishes were beautifully presented and coupled with a perfectly selected glass of wine. I was wonderfully surprised by the taste of so many dishes in our menu. The Chef has managed to bring out the taste of every product and garnish it in a way to bring out the best of it. I loved all dishes. The cooking techniques and mix of ingredients and products was in perfect balance.

Concerning the dishes, they were mostly without any major culinary surprises despite the good products used and for my taste two dishes that were too fatty.

2023-07-25,Food lover,"It was our third visit in the last two years. We arrived with memories of very tasty food, but also of slow service. We hoped to see improvement on that front, but unfortunately, our experience did not start or end well.  We waited for an amuse-bouche for almost 40 minutes, which was quite long, and we had expected quicker service. The first appetizer was served after another half hour, and the waiting time between meals remained long throughout the diner. It was at least twice the time that would be acceptable. After more than three hours, I mentioned the issue to the (otherwise very pleasant and friendly) waiters, but it had no effect on the pace of service. It took us over 5 hours to complete the 11-course meal. Moreover, the lack of air conditioning made the environment very hot, especially during a hot summer day.  While I thought the food was nice, I would definitely not repeat the experience again. I discreetly emailed my comments to the restaurant the next day, and I received a reply after two weeks. They apologized and mentioned delayed reconstructions, and they expressed hope that we would be fully satisfied next time. Bad excuse, because no one mentioned anyting during our reservation, upon arrival or when paying the bill. Not to mention that this was our third ‘slow’ experience, and that portable air conditioners are now sold at a lower price than the cost of a single dinner.   However, after careful discussion with other guests who were also present, we decided that three opportunities were enough. A Michelin-starred restaurant should provide a full service experience, not just good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r905563585-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en
2023-01-23,Ernest Novak,"The cold and sparse reception did not make an impression.  No explanation about the food.  That's something.  Freshwater fish are offered as sea fish.  Poor selection of wines by the glass for such an expensive restaurant.  Describing tannins in white wine (?!) is almost alarming.  Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.  The fish was tasteless, too greasy, practically inedible in the unfortunate combination.  The only positive thing was a really nice and good dessert, and of course the beautiful white landscape.  In short, STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r876113603-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en

It was 7 courses but with the chefs greetings and bonus desserts it felt more like 20.

I liked the dishes I ate in September slightly more than this time, but you have to know they use only homegrown, local, and foraged foods which vary throughout the seasons. Overall I was satisfied with everything and once again impressed by the flavors and the smart usage of wild leaves etc. Yes, expensive, but the price is normal for a Michelin star restaurant and if you know how to cherish gourmet food, you will understand that you pay for an experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r840087203-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,5,en
2022-03-25,Ales 924,"I heard it used to be a nice and good restaurant. Good inns are often hidden in remote locations - this is NOT the case here. The house is nothing special from the outside, nor is it inside, but it is poorly heated space - maybe they don't have firewood?!. The 3.5-hour time consuming food service consists of surrealistically small portions with a quasi-artistic touch and a high price. The “Michelin star” is vulgarly exploited to find the upper limit of guests ’naivety & stupidity. It all looks like a bad joke. To be able to separate the dish from the decoration, the staff constantly explains the composition of the miniature food brought on small pedestals. I also saw the head chef at the next table, he was quite a big guy - I thought - he probably eats somewhere else. The wine is good but nothing special.  CONCLUSION: this is not a restaurant, this is a very expensive and time consuming tasting of miniature portions of edible dishes ...

2021-07-07,Miha Š,"Me and my family have been long term customers and we’ve visited this restaurant a couple of times, always happy with the food and service.  We’ve even recommend it to others.  This last visit disappointed us so much, the restaurant sadly decided to minimize their portions and also the atmosphere changed.  Plates in summer 2021, post second covid lockdown, aren’t what they were in 2020 or even before. I would estimate they are 3 times smaller now!  We’ve been offered 2 pieces of bread throughout the evening, which is borderline insulting, the staff didn’t ask - not even once - if we are satisfied with the food, not even at the end when we left.  Food was mediocre, but most of all - it was tiny. 7 tiny plates for 60 euros, every plate consisted of maximum 2 bites with the main course being a joke. A small piece of fish.  So hungry now we are going for a take out, after spending 150 euros for nothing - a few bites!!  It’s sad to see what happened with this restaurant and sadly none of my family or friends will be returning.  Im not sure if saving money by minimizing the portions was worth it.

Elegant plates, completely different for each dish, proper glasses. I liked the food the first time, it now got even better and more sparkingly creative. The two five course menus are both excellent and well worth their price considering a wide range of amuse bouche and petit fours servings. Seasonality rules.

2023-06-07,James Y,"My wife and I and friends spent a weekend at La Cote Saint Jacques (“LCSJ”) Joigny in May. This was our fourth visit to La Cote Saint Jacques, spanning four decades. We had a wonderful time at this extraordinary venue. La Cote Saint Jacques has continued to evolve and reach new heights during its long and illustrious history. There is no better “base” from which to enjoy the marvelous wines and the charming village of Chablis and the villages of northern Burgundy.  We note that although Michelin has awarded two stars to LCSJ, in our judgment, LCSJ has always been a three star experience, offering far warmer hospitality and spectacular cuisine than we have experienced at three MIchelin star establishments in Burgundy and throughout France. In fact, we have had disappointing experiences at three star restaurants both with respect to the food and service at other venues, which pale in comparison to the service, graciousness and superb cuisine of LCSJ.  From the moment of arrival, guests are greeted warmly by the Lorain family and its long time staff, led by Marine Lorain. Ms. Lorain is deeply committed to maintaining the family’s great traditions of hospitality which extends over three generations and begins a fourth generation. As in past years, the service throughout our visit was impeccable, from the housekeeping to the spa and the massage therapy was excellent.  Sine our last visit, rooms at this “country inn” have been renovated. The accommodations are spacious; the bathrooms generously proportioned. Many rooms have views of the Yvonne River. The hotel  is situated on the bank of the river; its grounds have been beautifully landscaped, featuring spectacular cast iron sculptures from Sylvain Subervie which are illuminated at night.  The cuisine at La Cote Saint Jacques is extraordinary, a reflection of the culinary wizardry of Jean-Michel Lorain, now joined in the kitchen by his talented nephew, Alexandre Bondoux. In past years, the exceptional cuisine at LCSJ may have been considered to be “classical”; it has evolved and reached new heights, brilliantly marrying classical French techniques with modern, international influences. It is astonishingly refined and delicious. LCSJ also offers instructive cooking classes which we have enjoyed during previous visits.   Our dinners at LCSJ had many highlights, from the ethereal oyster terrine to the Flottante with Caviar, richly textured foie gras de canard, delicate blanquette de hommard and outstanding Ris de Veau (with ginger accents) to Agneau de lait des Pyrenees, a springtime lamb delight. However, the “piece de resistance” of our weekend was a birthday surprise for my wife - a magnificent Poulet de Bresse cooked in a coquette sealed with pastry dough and served with a melange of baby vegetables cooked with the famous Bresse bird. The Poulet de Bresse in coquette, a traditional technique for this renowned bird, was the idea of Matthias Lermercier, the restaurant’s adroit and acutely attentive manager and Stephen Guyard, the Maitre ‘ d who was our culinary guide throughout the weekend.Mr. Guyard is one of the most skilled, knowledgeable and gracious servers we have ever encountered in France. For a birthday dessert, Mr. Guyard presented a stunningly delicious “Mille Feuille”  with the lightest of crème filling, a fitting end to this incredible evening, a perfect interplay of opulence and elegance.  Together,  Matthias and Stephen worked to ensure that this was a special celebratory weekend for my wife and helped us to navigate through the spectacular dishes coming from the Lorain-Bondoux kitchen. Together with the outstanding Chablis and Burgundy in the LCSJ cellar (including a 2012 Les Clos from Dauvissat and a 2017 Valmur  from Raveneau), we had dinners that ranked among the finest we have had  -  truly at a three Michelin star level. The service in the restaurant  from Stephen and Matthias was so remarkably gracious and professional (and with abundant good humor), that it was reminiscent of the legendary service team at Taillevent from its late, revered owner Jean-Claude Vrinat and his long time lieutenants, Jean-Frederic Guidoni and Jean-Marie Ancher. We thank the Lorain family and the entire La Cote Saint Jacques team for its extraordinary hospitality. We look forward to returning to this elegant and magical venue.

2017-12-09,Paul C,"We wanted to visit this restaurant since September this year (2017) and we finally ended up going in December. It was a disappointment. First of all, it is in the middle of nowhere, we drove 2 hours from Paris (where we live) to get there.   Since we arrived at 7:00PM and the restaurant opens at 7:30PM, we were kindly invited to sit in the hotel lunge area and had a cocktail and an 'amuse bouche'. Then, the waiter asked us, @7:45PM if we wanted to be escorted to pour table: we gladly said yes, and got up... by the time we did, he was gone, and we would up sitting there for a good 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us what we want. For a Michelin restaurant with pretentions, this is unacceptable in terms of service.  The restaurant is at -1 on the hotel's floor plan: while descending with the elevator, my wife remarked it reminded her of going down to the OR when she had her last surgical operation.   The dishes are well prepared, at least for the main course, but very off balance: basically, you get a chuck of mean with no side (garniture), for some 76 EUR. They could at least have thrown in a third leaf of spinach to the two they forgot on the plate. If you also go for the starters, please take out another 88 EUR for two small scallops (per person). The gentleman next to our table had to put his glasses on to find them on his plate... don't get me wrong, I do not mind paying for quality but this is ridiculous.  For desert, the 3D chocolate that my wife had looked like a nightmare from a spacial geometry class, and was so sweet she could not eat it. My desert, the 'millefeuille' was way too sweet and wound up giving me acid burn, so I wound up taking a pill to try and bet able to digest when I got home. And by the way, the breadcrumbs that were on the desert plate brought pompously to my table by the waiter, and then wiped off in hurry by the waiter...  This place would have potential, if they had any sense of getting the portions and proportions right, but they have no idea. Honestly, go to Le Pret Catalan in Paris or Le Oiseau Blanc, you will pay less, have a hugely better meal, and won't have to drive 4 hours to the middle of nowhere and back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r546288365-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html,1,en

2017-08-14,AJCG,"We have eaten in hundreds of ""top end"" restaurants around the world. We found the food here disappointing with unusual tastes and flavours which spoiled the dishes. The signature Oyster terrine was unusual; very pretty to look at but, at the end of the day was just oysters. The Zander - a delicate river fish - had too much sauce and ""bready"" elements in both sauce and as additions. The snail dish was very nice although presentation could have been more refined. The flavours in the lamb were wrong and overpowering.

It was even better than the last visit as we were able to sample the spring/summer menu. Service was outstanding, attentive but not hovering. The dining room is quiet yet not stuffy. We asked the som to suggest a wine given our description of preference in a white wine. He suggested a modest chablis (60 euro) rather than a super pricey selection. It was spot on for our taste. Multiple choices for the fixed price menu, plus an excellent a la carte listing offered variety and quality as well. Be sure to order the oyster ""pate"" that appears to have been made with whole, raw (uncooked) oysters. Excellent.

2024-10-29,RorschAch,"Burning moxa pain The three-Michelin-starred Cocina Hermanos Torres in Barcelona, ​​Spain, was built in 2018 in a dilapidated tire factory in the Les Corts neighborhood of Barcelona and is run by twins Sergio and Javier Torres. The reason why the top overall decoration design (high ceiling) is supported by a steel frame and the open kitchen (there is no wall or counter between the kitchen and the guests) is due to their desire to fully restore their childhood memories of their grandmother's house (Catalina's upper-class family cook) or what they claim to be their dream ship - ""A kitchen of values ​​and flavors"" In 1986 Sergio went to Orrery in London and Javier went to El Racó de Can Fabes and Mugaritz for an apprenticeship. Then in 2008, the brothers opened their first joint restaurant Dos Cielos in Barcelona. The influence brought by this initial restaurant made them TV celebrities in Spain, hosting their own cooking show and appearing in other cooking and lifestyle programs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r977138975-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2024-10-16,PTPP,"I’m writing this review to warn potential diners about the disappointing and unfair experience I had with Cocina Hermanos Torres in Barcelona. I hope others will read this and be aware of the questionable reservation practices and lack of transparency that I experienced firsthand for a dining experience I didn’t even get to eat!   During my first trip to Spain, I used the American Express Dining Concierge where the concierge assistant placed me on a WAITLIST for a few time slots at this restaurant. The understanding from the concierge was clear: I would receive a call from the restaurant to confirm if any slot opened up. I only ever received emails saying no slots were available.  To my complete shock, I later got a call from the restaurant asking if I was on my way—something I was totally unaware of. There was no phone call nor communication notifying me that a reservation had been confirmed. How does a 3 Michelin Star restaurant that is supposed to be known for its service not call to confirm reservations nor ask if we have any food allergies prior to dining?   A few weeks later, I discovered a $608.07 charge on my credit card for a no-show! This situation has been extremely distressing. I reached out via multiple emails and phone calls to resolve the issue amicably, but unfortunately, the restaurant staff was neither helpful nor understanding. (Because I tried to ask my credit card company to help and they also had trouble reaching out to the restaurant, this attempt at a resolution has been dragged out for a year!)   The American Express Concierge confirmed that I was simply on a waitlist and never agreed to a confirmed reservation without notification. Additionally, the reservation system didn’t follow standard protocols—no confirmation call, no inquiry about food allergies, which is especially alarming given my travel companion’s severe coconut allergy. Had we unknowingly dined and any food contained coconut, it could’ve been dangerous.  To make matters worse, the restaurant’s emails were completely written in Spanish and provided no warning about: 1) charges for a no-show if a waitlist slot becomes available, 2) how the waitlist transitions to a confirmed reservation, and 3) ANY protocol to confirm reservations with the diner directly [since there most definitely should be a confirmation from the diner that they’re aware of the (newly) confirmed reservation and that they’re even alive].   Despite my attempts to explain the misunderstanding, the restaurant showed no compassion or effort to address the issue or find an amicable resolution. I even asked if we could potentially find a way to credit for a future dining experience, if I could come back to Spain, and they completely rejected any idea of this. Their refusal to help resolve the situation has left me feeling scammed, especially given the reputation of such a prestigious Michelin-starred establishment. This experience is a far cry from the level of care and professionalism I’ve come to expect from fine dining.  I strongly advise anyone considering Cocina Hermanos Torres to proceed with caution. If this restaurant cannot offer transparency in their reservation policies, it leaves diners vulnerable to unexpected and unjust charges. My experience has been both emotionally and financially burdensome, and I hope others won’t have to deal with the same.  Avoid this restaurant unless you’re ready to deal with potentially confusing and unfair practices—and don’t expect them to care about resolving issues if you become ill, an emergency happens, or something goes wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r974232282-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,1,en
2024-10-10,Susan G,I expected so much more from a three star and for the cost. Nothing was exceptional and some dishes were bad. The lamb was so chewy I had to spit it out. A lot of the seafood tasted off. The dessert courses were mostly pieces of candy. The service was not great. I had to ask for more water and we waited 20 minutes for the check. None of this is acceptable for the cost of the meal. We should have canceled the reservation in the days prior when they emailed asking if we wanted to order their shoes or add a rose to the meal.

Homophobic treatment - the servers gave explanations for 15 of the 16 courses except for the 14th course the Cocoa Age where they simply said ""okay, congratulations"", dropped the plate off without explanations, and quickly walked away 2. The sommelier just asked what wine I wanted, red or white, and brought something for us to try. I'm a certified wine professional with a WSET 3 passed with distinction, and out of the 75+ Michelin starred restaurants, I've not seen this nonchalant service 3. At the end of the meal, they just left me and my partner waiting.

My wife and I had a reservation at opening time and when the black shears parted and we were escorted into the restaurant, wow, we were blown away.  The setting was like something from a dream.  The dark wall coverings juxtaposed with the fluorescent lights shining down on the cooking stations in the middle of the restaurant, the professional wait staff attired in black suits and custom-made red leather high top sneakers.    My wife and I had never dined at a Michelin-starred restaurant (let alone one with three stars), so we clearly won’t be the most knowledgeable reviewer, but we were blown away.  We opted for the standard wine pairing with the multi-course dinner and enjoyed every morsel/sip.  The service – both the food servers and the sommelier – was outstanding, the experience was beyond compare.  We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and a nice personalized dessert was delivered along with a subtle, muted round of applause from the staff.

2024-02-25,Faycal B,"My experience with Cocina Hermanos Torres was disappointing and frustrating. Despite clear communication, the restaurant failed to honor the advertised testing menu price, insisting on a significantly higher cost due to a Mobile World Congress event. This lack of transparency and flexibility regarding pricing left me unable to proceed with my reservation. Furthermore, the apparent disregard for customer concerns suggest a lack of hospitality and empathy, qualities one would expect from a restaurant of a three-star Michelin.  Additionally, the restaurant's decision to use the Mobile World Congress event as an excuse to raise the price post-booking, rather than informing customers beforehand, is unacceptable. Despite sending three reminders to cancel my reservation and avoid my credit card being charged, there was no acknowledgment or response from the restaurant. This lack of attentiveness to customer requests further underscores the disappointing experience. True excellence in the culinary world extends beyond the food itself to encompass the entire dining experience, including customer service and communication. Regrettably, Cocina Hermanos Torres fell short in this regard, casting doubt on its suitability for recognition as a top-tier establishment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r939748728-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,1,en

2023-12-29,pdetemmerman,"Food was great, we liked the presentation, service was pro and we enjoyed the experience. However communication was poor, before and during dinner , we felt tricked. I reserved 4 months ago, at that time we had several pricing options, yesterday only the most expensive option at 295€. Furthermore during dinner w a menu w 20 dishes, they said if u want some pasta with truffles, just let us know. We said yes as we did not know they would charge us  on top of the 295 / pers menu. When i got the bill i found out that they charged us 333€ extra just for the pasta w truffles, it is not acceptable for a 3 * michelin, u feel betrayed and somehow it ruins the great  experience u just got. After complaining at least they waved the extra charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r931395832-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,4,en

2023-11-18,France,Unfortunately I was not impressed with the food at this restaurant. It was beautifully presented but the flavor profiles did not wow me in anyway.  I felt that the decor and the the delivery of the plates to the table fought with the meal experience.  Impressive but when did those two things become as important or in this case more important than the food?  The meal was overshadowed by the choreography of both  and just not at the level I expected.   ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r926426956-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,3,en

Going in, we honestly had no idea what to expect. This was recommended by a friend and we truly had no idea what the concept was, just reserved and showed up. (Not something I normally do, but hey when you trust a friends taste buds…)  Beyond happy we went and experienced every second of what this extraordinary restaurant had to offer and will be recommending it to any of our friends who travel to Barcelona!

2023-10-13,Michael S,"We ate at CHT on the 11th of October and couldn't have been more pleased at the excellence in the quality of food prepared for us. The piparras and smoke anchovy bonbon, crispy rubia gallega and Iberian ham and seafood salad, potato and kohlrabi danced in your mouth and had a slightly unexpected spicy finish. The mussels 'moqueca' prawns and king crab and the suckling lamb were favourites.  The attention to detail could not have been better. You never felt hovered over and you never noticed the waiters look directly at your table, and yet everything  was handled expeditiously. For instance, they observed that my partner and I are both left-handed and arranged the silverware accordingly.  I especially appreciated 1 of the brothers (twins run the establishment) came at the beginning of the meal and shook our hand. On another occasion, we asked for a picture to be taken of us, and magically both brothers appeared behind us for the picture.  Also of note, everyone wears read shoes that say the name of the restaurant a d indicates the 3 Michelin stars, which they so rightly earned.  It was truly a wonderful night.

Every staff you meet at the restaurant greets you with a big smile. Even though the restaurant has 3 star, the ambiance is more friendly and relaxed. Even the chef came to say hi. The menu is diverse in terms of taste, texture, ingredients and where the dishes came from. It is well presented, very modern and most importantly scrumptious. We loved every course that was presented to us. And the servers explains the idea behind each dish, ingredients and how to eat them. The mocktails are prepared based on your liking which I really loved. They were kind enough to accommodate me and my husbands dietary restrictions.

2024-09-23,Brian L,"My wife and I returned just last night from three weeks in China. King's Joy was one of our highlights so I wanted to write a review while our experience is still fresh.  Our hotel (Mandarin Oriental - stay there!) recommended King's Joy when we asked for the best vegetarian restaurants. We had no idea we were going to a three Michelin star restaurant nor what we were in for. What we were in for was a delicious culinary adventure with edible art and extraordinary service. This is a 100% vegetarian restaurant (that can easily do vegan if you wish) and will impress even the most picky of meat eaters. It is extraordinary what the chefs can do with vegetables.  First, the location is perfect. Just across the road from a Ming Dynasty temple, King's Joy sits quietly amongst a bustling Beijing cityscape. You could walk right past the restaurant and have no idea what was inside. It is a remodeled courtyard home from ages ago, and its modern elegance hides its ancient past. Amazing spot to eat!  Secondly, the food is as beautiful as it is delicious. Each portion is small but I promise you, you will leave full. The servers explain what you are eating as they bring it out, all of it local, all of it delicious. You get so many flavors and textures your tastebuds will explode in the best ways possible.  Thirdly, and certainly not last, the service is impeccable. Our server the first night, a *super* friendly and knowledgable guy named Jack, was as impressionable as the food and played a huge role in our decision to come back and dine there again. He spoke perfect English and was a wealth of information and friendliness. Should you choose to dine at King's Joy - and you should - request Jack as your main server; he truly felt like a friend and was a significant part of our experience.  Please, do yourself a favor and dine at this restaurant during your stay in Beijing. Should we visit the city again we will absolutely eat here again - twice at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r971095692-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,5,en

But boy what a disappointment , first of all they force you to pick same price /set course menu for all people on the table, which is limited the option to try different things. They have 3 sets of menu with different prices. My dad was upset about that but I was still hope the food is good, but the disappointment continues, same material repeat on most of dishes, basically tofu, bamboo or mushrooms , tastes is not good at all,  I was really questioning how they even got 3 Michelin stars?!

2024-06-17,E. B.,"For my wife’s birthday, we wanted a dining experience as special as the occasion itself during our stay in Beijing. We chose ""King's Joy,"" a renowned vegetarian restaurant celebrated for its culinary artistry and elegant ambiance—think big plates, small food, live music, and everything else that accompanies what seemed like sophisticated dining. While the restaurant largely lived up to its reputation, a few aspects left us with mixed feelings.  Highlights  From the moment we entered King's Joy, the ambiance set a tone of serene elegance. The restaurant's decor, a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and traditional Chinese design, created a warm and inviting atmosphere. Soft lighting and tasteful decor added to the intimate and cozy feeling, making it an ideal setting for our celebration.  The food at King's Joy was nothing short of exceptional. The highlight of our meal was the ""Nostoc Maize Grain in Burdock,"" a dish that perfectly showcased the chef's ability to elevate simple vegetarian ingredients into something truly extraordinary.  Adding to the enchanting atmosphere was a live harp performance by a talented musician near our table. Her soothing melodies provided a beautiful, calming backdrop to our meal, enhancing the overall experience and making our celebration feel even more special.  Another highlight of our dinner was the waiter who served us. His English was good, and although we had difficulty hearing his explanations of each dish clearly (we were seated right besides the harpist), he maintained a high level of professionalism and courtesy throughout the evening.  Peasant's Sadness  It is at this point that we, the peasants, experienced sadness. Despite the many positives, our experience was marred by a few disappointing moments. Some staff members appeared to be amused by our attempts to navigate the nuances of the ""cuisine sino-française haut de gamme"" and our unfamiliarity with certain dining customs. As visitors from the West, this behavior made us feel self-conscious and somewhat uncomfortable (no hard feelings, ladies; just try to be a bit more discreet...).  Moreover, we were seated at a large table for six, right in the middle of the restaurant, rather than at a smaller, more intimate table for two as we had hoped. This central location detracted significantly from the private and reclusive ambiance we had envisioned for our celebration.  Conclusion  In a sense, ""King's Joy"" offers a remarkable dining experience with its exquisite food, serene ambiance, and delightful live music. It stands as a top destination for those looking to celebrate special occasions with vegetarian cuisine in Beijing. However, the occasional lapses in respectful service and the less-than-ideal seating arrangements slightly dampened what could have been a flawless evening. Despite these issues, ""King's Joy"" remains a worthy choice for a more-than-average dining experience.  -----------  在北京旅行期间，为了庆祝我妻子的生日，我们想要一个与这特殊时刻相匹配的特别的用餐体验。我们选择了 “京兆尹”，一 家以其烹饪艺术和优雅氛围而闻名的素食餐厅——想象一下大盘子、小食物、现场音乐，以及所有看起来像是精致用餐的一切。虽然餐厅在很大程度上达到了它的声誉，但某些方面让我们有些失望。  优点  从我们踏入京兆尹的那一刻起，氛围就营造出一种宁静的优雅。餐厅的装饰，现代精致与传统中式设计的和谐结合，营造了一个温馨而令人愉悦的环境。柔和的灯光和精美的装饰增加了温馨和舒适的感觉，使它成为我们庆祝的理想场所。  京兆尹的食物简直是无与伦比的。我们这顿饭的亮点是 “黄花菜玉米粒搭配牛蒡”，这道菜完美展示了厨师将简单的素食食材提升为真正非凡的能力。  为我们用餐增添魅力的是一位才华横溢的音乐家在我们桌旁演奏的竖琴。她舒缓的旋律为我们的晚餐提供了一个美丽、平静的背景，增强了整体体验，使我们的庆祝活动显得更加特别。现场音乐为这次晚餐增添了个性化和优雅的色彩。  我们晚上的另一个亮点是为我们服务的服务员。他的英语非常流利，尽管由于我们离竖琴手很近，很难清楚地听到他对每道菜的解释，但他整个晚上都保持了高度的专业性和礼貌。  农民的悲伤  在这一点上，我们这些农民感到了悲伤。尽管有很多优点，我们的体验却被一些令人失望的时刻所掩盖。某些工作人员似乎对我们尝试理解 “高档中法混合料理” 和我们对某些用餐习俗的不熟悉感到有些好笑。作为来自西方的游客，这种行为让我们感到不自在和有点不安（没有恶意，女士们；只是希望你们能更隐晦一点)。在一家像京兆尹这样声名显赫的餐厅中，遇到这种不专业的行为令人惊讶。  此外，我们被安排在餐厅中间的一张六人桌，而不是我们所希望的更小、更亲密的双人桌。这种中央位置显著地削弱了我们对庆祝活动的私人和隐蔽氛围的预期。我们发现自己处在活动的中心，工作人员和顾客经常经过，这使我们很难享受我们为这特殊晚上所期望的温馨、隐蔽的氛围。  结论  从某种意义上说，“京兆尹”提供了一个卓越的用餐体验，其美味的食物、宁静的氛围和迷人的现场音乐使其成为在北京庆祝特殊场合的素食餐饮的首选之地。然而，偶尔的不尊重服务和不理想的座位安排略微影响了本来可能是完美的夜晚。尽管存在这些问题，“京兆尹” 仍然是一次愉快的用餐体验的值得推荐的选择。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r955513928-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,3,en

2024-02-15,Traveler2009,"King’s Joy is one of those restaurants that try to offer a culinary journey across their country, using a tasting, set menu.  There is no question that the food has been exquisite, and it does indeed offer a chance to experience ingredients from across China.  Also, it’s worth mentioning that the menu is 100% vegetarian!  Just like in any tasting restaurant each dish comes with a story. In this case it also comes along with an amazing presentation.    The wine menu is impressive as mentioned by many reviewers and you will for sure find something for your taste.       There are a few areas of improvement that I could suggest.  First off, having a sommelier available, or providing a bit of wine education for the staff would help – a lot.   Second, the food is really spectacular however some of the dishes would be even better when paired with the right drinks.  In my case I went with a Chardonnay that was great for most of the dishes, but some of the dishes clearly called out for a red wine.  It would be worthwhile for the restaurant to offer a drinks pairing menu. Third and last point, would be on providing even more training for the staff and improving on the marketing – the restaurant definitely has a story that needs to be told correctly. For non-Chinese customers, the restaurant should work a little bit on making sure the translation actually conveys the correct message!  At the end of the meal the waiter is offering dumplings or noodles.   The translation should emphasize that noodles at the end of the meal is a Chinese tradition – as you will see in many many restaurants. The waiter that attended me was speaking reasonably good English, but clearly not fluent.  His explanation of serving noodles, was to ensure clients are not hungry at the end of the meal….  With the portions being pretty small, it is possible that some customers could still be hungry by the end of the meal. Nevertheless, this is where a bit of savvy marketing would come in handy, not to mention that noodles at the end of a meal are the norm!  Also, this is an amazing vegetarian restaurant. Even more so considering it is located in China, which is not the first destination that comes to mind for vegetarian dishes.  The restaurant has some serious work to do on marketing and presentation of it’s story!  The setting of the restaurant, the décor, the service is very nice and comfortable like you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant.  Getting in is literally taking you to another world or peace and serenity, 100% opposite to the hustle and bustle of the street.  This is not a value restaurant by any stretch of imagination.  It’s clearly designed to be an amazing experience, and that it is! For me the experience was great, but not to die for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r938452171-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,5,en

At least, According to the previous mentioning terms , the only Michelin three stars vegetarian restaurant is an absolute right evaluation. Secondly, for the term of cuisine, the main course such as quinoa boletus wellington with red wine pineapple grapefruit enzymes is highly recommended, because, there is no difference between this & real steaks in taste & appearance.  Lastly, usually having fine dinner with wine is a routine for any type of Michelin restaurant, yet, for this restaurant, it offers different juice to service corresponding cuisines.

I had very good tea there and liked the decor at the waiting area. That's the end of it. The food was not the best veggie food I had ever had; the lady serving our table was the least to expect. Nothing rude from her, but just not that type of services for a waitress from this restaurant. Odd that all the other waitresses we had interaction with in that restaurant were all good. That lady did not serve our table only and maybe more attention was given to the other. I thought this restaurant was a competitor to Fu (Happiness) and Hui(wisdom) in Shanghai.

2024-04-17,Timfromsussex,This is an incredible place where they put heart and soul into what they are doing.   I do recommend you going but have to warn on price  hence 4 stars - I spent £1300 on a meal for two with one middling bottle of wine and a shared flight of (amazing) fruit juices.   That is too much.    For that the food and atmosphere have to completely blow you away and that didn’t quite happen.  All of the menu is inspired by an Island between Sweden and Denmark which - best will in the world - restricts variety of ingredients although they are valiant with what they had.   The meal was amazing with much time and care obvious - stand out - walnut tart - but struggle with another big winner of the 14 courses.   Juice flight was stunning work - brilliant and I was mightily impressed and inspired by that -   Each course had an explanation - whole thing spookily like the film “the menu” If you’ve seen it!      Was I glad I went - yes very nearly.   The price feels wrong by about 20/30%.  But you can see where the cost comes from.   You can see I have mixed feelings as it’s a huge effort of will and creativity.   Restaurant was full too and all seemed happy -   If you can afford reasonably easily - go.   If it’s a one off and you want your socks blown off - then it’s a maybe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r947056992-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,4,en

The restaurant offers a fixed menu with 14 different servings, wine, or juice pairings (don't miss the incredible juice pairing). Dietary needs are considered (you have to tell them in advance). There are only eight tables; the kitchen is open-sight, and the chefs themselves serve the menu and explain ingredients and preparation. The style is minimalistic, with the accent on fish, vegetables, and preserves, most of them coming from the island of Bornholm. The service is impeccable, and the ambiance is friendly and elegant.

Every bite was a delightful explosion of flavors, probably with the exception of one - pork - which was delicious yet a little heavy for me (mostly because I am less of a carnivore than I thought I was).

Except for the prawns which were a little too rich for me, all dishes were amazing -- especially the peas wrapped in fig leaves which reminded me of a Peruvian childhood dish.

Where every dish is a culinary masterpiece and an objet d’art in the skilled hands of its many passionate sous-chefs under the direction of its chef. A soft spoken man with an eye for detail. This establishment is a 2 star Michelin deserving the third. It is understated maintaining an air of hospitality than arrogance away from the normal attitude of restaurants at its level. Attire is INFORMAL which bodes nicely and removes all pretence from its guests and staff. Every member of the staff is conversant on the particulars of each dish.

As fine as dining gets and distinctions in this ethereal realm between 2 and 3 star Michelin eateries are hard to discern.  The only tiny critique: the non-alcohol drink pairings were a little one-not and on the sweet-tangy side.  A couple had the main fruit juice component overwhelm the other flavors.

When my husband mentioned that De Nieuwe Winkel in Nijmegen was crowned the Best Vegetable Restaurant in the World two years in a row by We're Smart, I knew that I had to experience it for myself. We took a spontaneous detour, canceling our reservation at L'Arpège in Paris for our anniversary dinner to savor the flavors of Chef Emile van der Staak's Botanical Gastronomy. Tucked away in the former Catholic orphanage of Nijmegen, finding this hidden gem added an extra layer of adventure to our evening. Chef Emile's dedication to showcasing the best of Dutch ingredients amazed us. Nearly everything sourced locally, from Food Forest Ketelbroek to Ommuurde Tuin, Bodemzicht, and even green tea from Brabant. It's a true celebration of eating local taken to the next level. In Chef Emile's words, ""Once nature has done its work, it is our turn. We pick. Smell. Taste. Analyze. Ferment. Cook. Until there is something on your plate that amazes and overwhelms you."" Our enthusiasm for tasting the custom-made botanical drink pairings led to an exclusive tour of their lab. Witnessing the craftsmanship behind the scenes, from cheese to tempe, nukazuke, and all the botanical drinks, was an eye-opening experience.

Now the flipside: I did not like certain dishes, which can happen. But no one asks how the dish was when they clear it, and when I told them that I did not like a dish, the only question was 'Shall I then clear it?' I would have expected that if you don't like two or three dishes (and they are all a surprise for you) that you offer an alternative. Or at least a free coffee at the end. But nothing. When I raised this to the chef/owner, he told me that this did not fit in his cooking process and that he actually was not interested in his clients' feedback on the dishes.

All of the dishes, even for well-seasoned vegans, were surprising in that many were unrecognisable with unique appearances and tastes. The sunflower butter and accompanying crackers, for example, were delicious. The use of unusual ingredients such as a local lemongrass and Kliswortel is admirable.  However, several dishes were also disappointing: the coiled cabbage (with silky tofu) and the (undercooked?) leek (in the superb Spirulina algae broth) were stringy and tough to break down; the ""chocolate"" desert was very oily; and the vegan cheese dish wrapped in vine leaves was rather distasteful; and the “risotto” was too rich. The wine pairing was OK (the smoked white wine is perhaps an acquired taste) and the non-alcohol version is to be recommended with unusual tastes.

Wines and beers: same.

Luckily the bread was nice otherwise I would have had to have an actual dinner when coming back home. Out of the 6 wines, 2 were some kind of beers that have nothing to do in this pairing. Tasteless, very sour and extremely disappointing. The dessert was the cherry on the cake, although I wish there had been actual cake and cherry. Hay ice cream sandwich between two hay cookies. Maybe it's very original and unique but come on. So, we paid 240 euros for 2 for a disappointing very light dinner. But hey, it's hype to be vegetarian, right?

2018-04-14,Robert K,"We went this evening to restaurant De Nieuwe Winkel, because it has a great recommendation on tripadvisor. It is a small cousy restaurant with trendy staff. We could choose between meet (chicken), fish or vegetarian menu.  Because we had some appetite we choose the 6 courses menu with fish. You get something different comparing to other fancy places. We choose fish, so you expect some fish. One of the starters had a bit of fish in it and that was it. The main course was a tasty piece of a carrot (but then purple) and the second main course some beet. Loved the dessert most. A tasty appel and a nice vegie cheesecake variation. We had a nice evening, but at the end we had to laugh about it.  If we would go here with our parents they would call us crazy. 160 euro for a petit carrot and beet as main-course. Ridiculous.  So if you are a vegetarian and you want something tasty this is the place, but you pay a lot for it. If you want a nice piece of fish or meat better go to another place.

The setting is minimalistic , rather sober and casual , a little sub ..  . The service is prompt , the staff  warm , friendly and ready to explain or providing a helping comment where decrypting the dishes sometimes is necessary . And they evidently enjoy this in a slightly teasing , but overall professional way . The level of team spirit is to be admired .    Behind the name  ""A new store""  a deliciously wonderful and creative approach is  used by the young chef and his equipe , to transform classic grocery ingredients to a fantastic delicatessen level .  Respect for biological protective principles and fresh quality  is outstanding .  It confirms the hand of a promising master , passionately weaving new techniques and associations around  old standards with surprising flavours and freshness .  At the end not the cheapest of bills ( 92 € - 5 courses & associated wines/juices/beer ), but this type of commitment and work deserves a merit .

2024-09-26,mokstarr7,"I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.  First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.  Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.  Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.  I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses. This is yet another example of how service is lacking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r971450381-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,3,en

Anyone who longs to taste beef without the real sensation of meat (small dark pieces of something supposedly to be beef) ought to be confronted in The Rutz Weinbar & Restaurant.

2023-08-17,AnGr2013,"We had dinner here. My wife and I eat at Michelin restaurants occasionally and were really looking forward to this. Our table was at the ground level of the hotel, felt like a dark hotel lobby with simple furniture. We were placed at a table for four which made me feel the whole evening as if two guests were missing at our table. If I book for two, I want to sit at a table for two.  For the entire dinner experience the dull elevator music was in an endless loop and the presentation of the food was the same. Every dish in a large plate with a tiny, tiny dish in the middle, all dishes accompanied by some extra sauce poured or crunch that was served with a lot of tamtam.   All dishes came with unbelievably elaborate explanations, at some point I felt tempted to tell the waiters that I just want to eat my food and not listen to them. The portions were miniscule even for three star Michelin standards.  The more explanations a dish needs, the less I trust it. Good food needs to speak for itself.      The desserts should be the grand finale, when the kitchen pulls out all the stops to bring the meal to a grandiose  ending. Far away from that in our experience.   Last but not least the wine menu: I find my way around any wine menu and dont need the help of the sommelier. But the Rutz wine menu doesnt even tell me if the wine is white or red (for appellations that produce both) I felt almost embarrassed to ask the sommelier.  And when the bill came and I saw I was charged EUR 32 for a 0.1l glass of champagne, I left the place angry and will not return.

2023-06-16,Xierwan,"We were eager to try the restaurant, as we had many good surprises with German chefs who had emigrated to countries other than Germany. Indeed, the country seems to have taken the same direction as its northern European neighbours for several years, with on the one hand a modern and inventive cuisine and on the other a completely revisited traditional cuisine.  The restaurant itself is superb, as well as the terrace, on which we were seated. The wines and food were all extraordinary without exception, as they should be in any establishment of this range (and with these high prices, it must be said).  The service is smooth, professional but also very relaxed, just like in any Scandinavian restaurant and also as nice and friendly as are the inhabitants of Berlin. Special thanks to the sommelier for his excellent advices and to the waiter who gives a casual thumbs up to signify that he is happy with our praise of the food.  This was a great experience for us, but I would perhaps not recommend it to people who think high gastronomy should always be buttoned up to the neck with old fashioned and stiff waiters in suit.

2023-06-07,MartinTafft,"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  We had high hopes and expectations from the reputation and the three Michelin star badge.  We regularly visit good restaurants when we are on our travels at home and in Europe.    We chose to have the eight course menu with the accompanying wine flight.  Things started pretty well with two or three really tasty and enjoyable amuse-bouche dishes.  Unfortunately, as the meal progressed we found ourselves increasingly disappointed by the standard of some of the dishes.  We also had a very distinct feeling that a number of the dishes were just far too oily.   Normally, the selected wines that accompany each course have the function of enhancing and complementing the flavours of the dishes, however, it felt as though they had been selected to try to combat the oiliness of the dishes.  Before we came to the end of the meal, we both were beginning to feel the slightly ill effects of the greasy nature of the meal.  When I compare this experience with many other recent experiences of less well acclaimed restaurants, and some other one and two star restaurants, I found it both disappointing from a culinary and flavour experience and also poor value for money.

We absolutely loved this dinner - it was one of the best we've had in a long time, and we've eaten at numerous 3* Michelin restaurants all around the world.

We especially loved the carp, the Mangalitsa pork, the nonalcoholic juice pairings, and the local German wines. They take humble ingredients and make them magical via alchemy - every dish was spectacular in its flavor, and the portion sizes perfect - we were full without the overfull, bloated feeling at the end of the meal. We loved the local German elements they incorporated into the meal - most of the ingredients are from local farmers and producers, although they are not fanatical about this and the emphasis really is on quality and making the meal fantastic.

Our 10 course menu with wine accompaniment (with and without alcohol) was an experience in itself...   The Roots vegetable garden is a taste experience with around 30 different vegetables.   The trout with broccoli was perfectly cooked, couldn't be better!  Risotto with corn - once different!!  The main course with the quail and kohlrabi, along with the ingenious sauce, which had power and a lot of deep, was just awesome. A huge leap too soon!   The dessert creations, whether with zucchetti, olive oil or fruity, were the perfect conclusion.  The whole thing was rounded off by the warm and perfect service team.

2024-10-13,Jiggy,"OMG yes! If my only dish I could eat for the rest of my life was the Oysters & Pearls, I'd be in heaven. What you don't expect about The French Laundry is how approachable not only the menu is, but how unpretentious the space and the atmosphere is - the music is all upbeat and contemporary. The staff is, as you would expect, super friendly. And the food - well it's what you've come for and what you won't be disappointed with no matter how much you've built the experience up in your head. I enjoyed every bite - even the one bite of lobster I had before giving the rest to my wife, because I really don't eat seafood. But by all means, make sure you get the Oysters & Pearls, you might be tempted with the supplement, but you'd be making one of the biggest mistakes of your life. Also, be prepared that the upfront cost is really just a down-payment - once you get done with the wine, you can easily double the cost of the meal. But it's worth it - because how often are you coming back?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r973795251-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html,5,en

2024-07-23,dtvogen,"Love Thomas Keller and all he does so much.  Finally made it to TFL for our 30th anniversary.  Our expectations were so high and we worried we would leave with some disappointments (as we have done with a few other of the world’s bests), but nothing disappointed.  The staff was amazing – attentive, congratulatory doing several things to recognize our anniversary, engaging, and proud of what they were serving.  The food did not disappoint either.  So many top restaurants stretch with gastronomic “art”, but TFL is just incredibly well done fine dining.  Each course was amazing but really enjoyed the mainstay Oysters and Pearls (it stays on the menu for a serious reason), lobster, truffle mac and cheese (most tasty supplement), and Elysian Fields lamb.  Even the salmon cone amuse was great and the perfect start.  And the whole complement of desserts did not disappoint.  Unlike many fixed menu restaurants, they do not have a fixed set of wine pairings, but our sommelier worked with us on about five half bottle selections to pair perfectly.  It’s a one-in-a-lifetime bucket list meal that we definitely want to find the next special occasion to go again.  Get the kitchen tour too – unbelievable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r960864617-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html,5,en
2024-07-22,Kathryn N,"This review is way overdue- as we were there nearly 3 years ago now. I honestly forgot to do a review and we’re planning another trip to Napa for September. When someone asked me if we were going back to French Laundry and my automatic response was “no”, I thought maybe I should do a review.  We know a fair number of people who have been to TFL and loved it, so honestly, maybe we just were there on an off night. Firstly, our server was a woman with dark hair (can’t remember her name), and she was just kind of cold and unfriendly. My two biggest complaints are 1. They seemed like they were rushing us the entire time. To the point where they had brought out half the courses in less than an hour. I actually had to ask them to slow down, which they did, but it felt like we were an inconvenience. Kind of strange and disappointing- you go there expecting to spending close to 3 hours, and I think we were out in 2. And it would have been less if I wouldn’t have asked them to slow down.  2. The second issue was that several of the courses were lukewarm, at best. For what you’re paying, that’s pretty unacceptable. Normally, we would have said something but the server was so unfriendly, and we’d already asked them to slow the service down, so it just didn’t feel worth it.  Some of the courses were quite good, and the wine list is amazing. We also loved that the have you a peek in the kitchen at the end.  Again, it might been an off night. Maybe the woman that was serving us for a good portion of the meal had a bad day or whatever, but between that and the fact that several courses were cold, we probably won’t be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r960713938-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html,3,en

2023-11-24,snashr1,"A major disappointment! I had been looking forward to a 3* Michelin experience, but while the food was (mainly) good, it was not exceptional. I believe Michelin are threatening their own reputation as the leading guide for fine dining if they allow French Laundry to retain their current rating. The Sommelier was most interested in how much he could extract from the group (when the first question is what is your budget it should have been a clue) rather than trying to ensure the best match of wine to the various dishes. I found the Cobia delightful and the Duck excellent, but the rib of lamb was not tender. The desserts were also good, but too many. The overwhelming experience was one of a restaurant that was living on its reputation and had become complacent. The manner of the staff was a little pompous and yet there are much better 1* establishments around and nothing could ever justify the price this place charges.

It looked like sludge (see picture attached) and tasted worse.  The cheese course was also bad.  My dinner companions who had the regular tasting were equally disappointed.  The lamb was tough.  The fish was also bad.  The wine pairings were very average and astronomically expensive.  None of the wines were particularly good.  Some were not yet ready to drink and most did not complement the food.  It was obvious the sole objective of the sommelier was to increase the wine tab.  All of the other 4 restaurants we ate at in Yountville were significantly better and were 1/4 of the price.  I am shocked this place has 3 stars.

2019-07-07,Oldenbarnevelt,"If you want a three star experience for a one star pricetag, my advice is to go there for the lunch menu. During the three hours that we were there, we experienced nothing but gastronomic delight. Six amuses, five courses, a playful dessert, some herbal candy from their garden and the bill was more forgiving than in some mediocre Michelin star restaurants.   They tried their very best to serve us in Dutch, even though the restaurant is in the French speaking part of the country. My advice would be to assign Dutchspeaking  waiters to specific tables, so that the information about the dishes is crystal clear. We felt silly because we didn't understand everything, but it's our fault for not speaking French. And again, they did their utmost best.  The view during lunch is very interesting as you can see how delicately the flowers and herbs are being handpicked for the next mise en place. And we were lucky to be next to the kitchen which allowed us a peek into the Chef's headquarters.  Of the five main dishes, only the quail with the eel and foix gras was slightly underwhelming and felt somewhat out of place. I guess one of the playful chocolate lollypops was far too sweet, but then again they are lollypops.  I'm sure the clients would appreciate it if the chef showed his face at the end of the experience, but I understand that he is probably preoccupied with making sure that every bite is as perfect as the next.  My new favourite restaurant.   ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1756478-d786401-r687554642-L_air_du_temps-Eghezee_The_Ardennes_Wallonia.html,5,en

2019-06-25,MIFILL,We went there to celebrate our 30th anniversary with our children.  We were welcomed and received a rond table near the large windows where we had a spectacular view on the garden and the country side.  From beginning to end everything was just perfect; the appetisers all the dishes and then the dessert as apothéose was set on a special table cloth and covered all the table. It was exceptional.  Also the wines were out off this world. The service was also top. Very friendly and not to stiff.

With a group of eight chef's we had a dinner at the Chef's Table.  6 'official' courses which are actually way over 10 accompanied by their selection of wines. Sang-Hoon took the time of explaining his ideas and how the dish was formed for every course. These dishes were fine dining pro forma. All was executed perfectly by the, ofcourse, highly trained staff. This place is heaven on earth, gastronomy at it's finest degree. The Michelin stars are well, well deserved.

We had the 7 course (I think it was 7) dinner. Started out with some delicious amuses. The main (pigeon) was seriously the best pigeon I ever ate. The garden view was also perfect. Only minor criticism I have is that when you come there, you go to the first room to have some snacks. And there is only the option to have some champagne or other sparkling wine as a aperitif. It would be -for me- also good to order a bottle of wine and already start there.

He personally greets you upon arrival, comes visit several times during dinner and leads the way out once the meal is complete.  Every dish served is a artwork. A triumph of tastes and colors.

2018-12-27,ClowAR,"We were staying at the Mercure next door and made a reservation for dinner. Everything was exceptional! Probably the best fish dishes we've ever had, and we've been to plenty of starred restaurants. We took the 5 course menu dégustation with 5 wine pairings. All the wines went really well with the dishes. We loved every dish too. We changed the first course from snails (I don't eat) to the rouget, and that might have been my favorite. It's hard to decide, they were all so delicious! Service was great too. I think this restaurant might be my new favorite. And it was right next to Les Balneades (spa) so it was a perfect couple of days getaway.

The lamb? Half a bite! Returning from fishing? Portions to cry, ten seconds of pleasure, but no more.

Having fallen into a gastronomic desert, the city finds with ""La table d'à coside"" a worthy successor to the 4 starred restaurants of the 80s.  A sober and very tasteful setting combines with an excellent welcome. At the table, a delicate presence settles in. You don't have to wait several long minutes before the Chef comes in person to invite you to open the ball of flavors. We avoid long hesitations among the choices by offering you 3 types of menus, which must satisfy the most demanding.  The Chef will then be followed by friendly and attentive staff who provoke the desire for discoveries to come.  To confirm the comparison to a ball, it is a series of ballets which follow one another where the actors of the composition of your choice come themselves to serve you and present their dishes to you. A very original method which illustrates, as in the theatre, a communion between the artists and the audience.  A well-deserved star.

2024-10-28,Magnus B,"This review is based on ""value for money"". We paid EUR 500 per person for an experience at a two-star Michelin restaurant and Il Gallo D'oro is way off the mark. I've eaten at restaurants with one, two or three stars before, and this place is well below par.  The ambiance in the place is horrible. It feels like a conference room at the hotel where they have put a few tables. No thought has been put into creating an atmosphere worthy of a two-star restaurant.  The service is slightly below ""adequate"". The staff go through the moves in a slightly robotic fashion. No genuine feeling at all. The chef made an appearance without seeming to be interested in whether we liked the food or not. He had been told to be there, so he was.  The presentation of the food is very good and lives up to the two stars. Almost every dish is beautiful to look at and the looks are imaginative.  The dishes taste OK, but not more. A few of them are good, but the rest of them are below what you would expect from a two-star restaurant. Of course they are better than at a regular restaurant, but you expect more from a restaurant where you pay EUR 500 per person. Also, there is way too little food. I would not expect to have to eat a double-serving of bread to feel full. All dishes are VERY small. After all, I don't expect to have to go to McDonalds after paying so much for food.  Good value for money? Absolutely not and stay away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r977037006-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,1,en

2024-06-15,Trek401987,"Everything is subjective, but we honestly do not understand why this restaurant gets good reviews. It is stuffy and overpriced.   The food looks beautiful, but the taste is nothing special, especially considering the number of fabulous restaurants on the Island that are a fraction of the price.  It has held its 2 stars for a long period, so perhaps it was just us, and many people we spoke with had been many times before.  There is little atmosphere. Everyone has to whisper. The window seats are great until it gets dark and then all you see is a reflection of yourself as there is no lighting outside. You cannot use the terrace until July!   The servers are amazing, and explain the food and wines very well. It was just the food, whilst looking amazing, was just bland.   As I said at the beginning of this review - everything is subjective, but if you are in doubt, don't spend the money to come here - go to one of the local restaurants that have a great atmosphere, are more romantic in terms of setting, and have arguably better tasting food.

The meal began with a delightful Couvert, offering a selection of breads accompanied by an assortment of four butter flavours: regular, black octopus ink, garlic, and Madeira red wine, along with some local olive oil. This thoughtful introduction showcased the restaurant's commitment to creativity and attention to detail. We were then presented with an amuse-bouche of espada with onions and red pepper. The delicate flavours of the espada, combined with the sweetness of the onions and the red pepper were amazing. For starters, we went for the lobster avocado cannelloni with gazpacho pearls and caviar. Each bite was a was a taste explosion. For the main course, my wife opted for the pigeon smoked with eucalyptus and cinnamon, while I chose the dover sole steak with tortellini and a prawn bisque sauce. The pigeon was presented within a box that when opened filled the place with its smoky aroma and subtle hints of eucalyptus. The sole was so tender and the sauce so flavoursome. For dessert I had the biscuit box and my wife the daisy. Throughout our dining experience, the service at Il Gallo d'Oro was impeccable. All the staff were attentive and knowledgeable, even the Host, ensuring that every aspect of our meal was flawlessly executed and that we felt truly pampered from start to finish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r939389668-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,5,en
2023-12-31,SKGEmmanuel,"I wish I could rank them higher, but I cannot justify anything beyond that.  We opted for the Terroir Experience (11 moments) with champagne, wines, and drinks.  On the positives, the sommelier was extremely professional, knowledgeable and pleasant to interact with. Our wine was corked (which happens, it’s just naturally and inevitable), but he dealt with it very well and with such a natural response that was pure joy to observe, very professional.  However, the service by the servers was not immaculate and to the level reasonably expected in a stared restaurant, and there were weaknesses (though not for a single moment would I doubt the best intentions of the personnel, who were pleasant and nice, but simply not adequate for a stared restaurant, so it is assumed to be a matter of training).  Food-wise, while I recognise that it is subjective, compared to other stared restaurants we have visited before, I can understand how 1 star could be warranted. However I simply cannot justify 2 stars on any front, and it felt like there were some issues on consistency and execution was some way away from perfection. Same goes for the price-tag, which does not feel like it is proportionately supported by the substance and quality of the dishes.   Therefore, while I am pleased to have tried this restaurant, I am not currently in a position to recommend it as a stared restaurant that is worth a visit. Equally, I would not class it as a value-for-money restaurant, in the sense that you do not get adequate return for the prices charged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r931846047-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,3,en

One of the party is a coeliac, I  checked that their website was able to cater for her  and also emailed for confirmation that it was OK. On the night, they simply  removed any sauces from the menu ( we all had the 8 course tasting  225  euro menu), and her gluten free bread had the texture and appearance of profiteroles, hollow inside. Given that the hotel that we are staying in can prepare a daily breakfast basket of many diferent kinds of breads and pastries and cakes, this and the missing sauces made her feel not particularly welcomed . The staff are lovely and very attentive, but as the host I could just feel the whole celebratory evening slipping away,  and would say that it was a very disappointing evening not just for her but the various dishes were confused with perhaps simply too many elements on them. I don't regularly do reviews and when I do it's usually because we've had such a great meal, but today is simply because it wasn't great, it used to be , and maybe the mantra   ' less is more' could be considered going forward, but I probably won't be there to find out.

When I did do the reservation, they only had one star and I was not aware about the recent development. So I did struggle all the evening to understand how blind the Michelin testers could have been to not leave two or even three stars for this restaurant. Just when I got the bill which had the two stars and the green one imprinted. I could do justice to the Michelin testers… And I really think there is potential for a third star. We have been to the only two 3* restaurants in Norway just one respectively seven days before, so we could well compare. And we would rate the Kontrast in between. To be precise we would place it ahead of Maaemo.   The only thing they need to work on is the acoustic at their place . it’s rather loud, which makes it difficult to understand the explanations about the dishes and drinks.

2023-09-23,Michael U,"Born in Skåne Mikael Svensson began his career in Oslo before stints with 3* Spaniards Quique Dacosta and Martin Berasategui, a focus on ""organic and ethically sourced Ingredients from within Norway"" seeing Restaurant Kontrast show off local producers and the Animals they raise.   Stating “the end result is never better than the quality of the Product you start with,” a fact frequently overlooked in today’s low-cost and convenience driven market, it is through temperatures and textures frequently found in juxtaposition that Svensson builds layered bites tied together through the use of acid, fermentation and Herbs.  A fifteen-course tasting that begins in the lounge, cement floors and exposed ceilings creating an industrial feel that magnifies noise from other tables, opening bites consist of bold flavors such as Scallops with bitter Vegetables and Shrimp with Horseradish before moving on to a delicate Donut followed by a Pork Blood Croustade topped in Vinegar-splashed Cheese.  Going down the street for a Sunchoke and Tim Wendelboe Coffee before taking a seat in front of the open kitchen, just five Chefs running three seatings simultaneously, a vibrant White Wine from Hungary proved adept to handling first Turnips and Sea Snails with Caviar then poignant Crab Curry imbued with Garum atop Carrots and Sour Cream.  Refusing to outsource Sauces, Mikael’s XO a three-year process made on-site, Crucifers spung to life before Wild Halibut and Chicken with Mushrooms, Soy and a complex reduction featuring Yellow Wine with Sweet Corn.  Slowing as the room filled up, lengthy waits between courses seeing the final four items take longer than the first eight, aged Lamb brought plenty of flavor to match Cherries plus Coffee before frozen Kraftkar Bleu Cheese and Sunflower Seed Ice Cream shocked the palate in preparation for elegantly arranged Plums followed by Mignardises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r918050054-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en

2022-08-02,midway42,"Michael Svensson is a Swedish chef that followed the long, arduous road to his current location that many creators/proprietors have travelled before and will in the future.  Born and raised in Sweden, he attended culinary school in Kristiansand and then spent an internship at Le Canard in Oslo.  After traveling in Europe and working at several Michelin restaurants to continue his education, he returned to Oslo and eventually opened Kontrast (without any investors!) in 2013.  The restaurant is at its second location in a sparse, industrial-like space (Vulkan) and received its first star in 2016.  It has retained that distinction ever since.  I was met at the front desk, my reservation confirmed, and immediately brought to a couch by the kitchen.  I ordered an aperitif (“Lost in Oslo”… named because if you have more than one you will reflect the title) and four nibbles followed: razor clams, grilled tomato, mackerel with cucumber/wasabi, and a fantastic pork blood “croustade” with Holtefjell XO cheese.  An eight-course meal ensued at my table in the dining room with a wine pairing.  This was very well done and followed the classic “lighter fare to heavier fare and then dessert” concept that is universal at these places largely because it makes sense.  Highlights included grilled wild halibut (with zucchini and pesto) and pork belly (with cabbage, black apple, and bread miso sauce).  Service was flawless, with the maitre'd Sylvester being equally considerate, professional, knowledgable, and attentive.  I made the comment several times during the meal that “a one-star in Europe equals two in the US,” and the more I think about it a more honest and less offensive way of saying this is “this restaurant clearly is in two-star territory.”  I’ve eaten at over eighty Michelin restaurants on four continents and had bumps-in-the-road on all of them;  Kontrast clearly is a highlight.  The fact that they focus on sustainable food and smaller purveyors only made a great experience better.  This was an overall fantastic meal and one I would consistently return to if I lived in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r851488299-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2021-10-11,PaulMG4,"Either we dined on an unlucky night, or the chef needs to review quite a few of the dishes. I have rarely experienced this lack of equilibrium in dishes: for instance the scallop, a sweet and delicate affair on its own, was absolutely butchered by one of the overly acidic sauce. Choosing to serve frozen blue cheese (and a lot of it) as a pre-dessert is also a significant faux-pas. I generally agree with Michelin ratings, but I am failing to see the flair and ability here.  The service was good at the beginning, but the pace of the dishes was awfully slow and I feel that the waiters got tired and bored as the night progresses. To the point that we barely got a 'thanks' after paying. The last hour of service was probably the worst I have ever experienced in a similar establishment. I only save the french sommelier as she was efficient and nice throughout the entire service, the only true professional in my opinion.  And at around 200 euros per person, I would completely avoid the place if you know your fine dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r813996325-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,2,en

2021-07-30,KnutMarius,"Delightful in every aspect. Fantastic service, pleasant ambience, and of course an impeccable meal. Set aside the entire evening, and don’t make any plans for the following morning.  Me and my partner went to Kontrast on a Thursday evening. We weren’t celebrating anything, but perhaps we should have; one is so well taken care of that a visit there feels like a reward or a gift.  From the very start one is met with professionalism and great service. We were greeted at the door by a smiling and welcoming head waitress which set the bar for the whole evening. The premises were sparsely decorated, but well-kept and most importantly - clean. Even though we sat in a relatively small room with approx. 15 tables, it didn’t feel crowded. The acoustics were spot-on, making the experience intimate as one is not disturbed by noise from the room. We had no problem conversing at a casual volume, which is remarkable considering the fact that the guests dine in the same room as the kitchen where the chefs are at full work. They even managed to place a little lounge area between the dining area and the entrance without it feeling stuffed or out of place. This restaurant is a case in point to the importance of architecture and interior design.  The food was, as expected, flawless. Everything from the combination of flavors to the presentation of the dishes to the construction of the menu to the variety of ingredients used was spot on. The attention to detail dedicated to the arrangement on the plate was immaculate, the work of true artists. The highlights of the evening were the strawberry dessert with sunflower seed butter (a match made in heaven with the salt and sweet), the kale and cauliflower dish (the kale was cooked to perfection) as well as the halibut with rucola sauce (the intense taste of chlorophyl from the sauce went like a charm with the fish).  There were some exciting surprises during the meal - duck breast cured in coffee (delicious), poached oyster covered in sour cream, and crab marinated in aquavit. For the most part, however, the combination of flavors was conventional - seafood and cucumber, strawberries and cream, veal and mushroom. Which is not to say that it is a bad thing. Their craftmanship is uncontested, but their experimentation with flavors and preparation techniques wasn’t cutting edge. The freeze-and-crumble technique that was used on the blue cheese, for example, was neat but it’s getting a bit old.  We ordered, as we always do, one juice pairing and one wine pairing. The juice pairing was a gift that kept on giving, with each new glass more delicious than the last. Many of the juices consisted of different varieties of tea, and I firmly believe that some had the potential of being sold as soft drinks in their own right. Anyone dining at Kontrast simply must try the juice pairing.  Some food for thought did enter my mind as we progressed through the meal. No menu was provided for the evening. During the presentation of each dish it was at times hard to catch everything of what was being said, as well as remember it afterwards. Without the menu, we weren’t able to go back or double-check the ingredients of each dish. As we discuss every aspect of these kinds of meals vigorously, we both would have appreciated information about the menu in writing in order to refer to it later.  I would have skipped one dish. We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal and one dish in particular seemed, in hindsight, unnecessary. It was a squid dish, consisting mainly of pasta. With the overweight of seafood in the meal, the squid dish being quite basic, and with the carbs taking up so much precious intestinal space, the meal would have been all the better for it.  The name of the restaurant also begs the question: what contrasts? Again, the food was immaculately prepared, but whatever contrasts found therein were customary. Salt in contrast to the sweet. Crunch in contrast to the creamy. Red in contrast to the green. I would have expected nothing more from a 1-star restaurant. Surely the name isn’t a play on such basic knowledge in cooking? So if not the food, then where?  The choice of wines at times was not optimal to my taste. The cheese dish, consisting of maple syrup, blue cheese and ice cream would have fared better with a sweet white wine rather than the port-like red wine we were served. And I also wasn’t too fond of the Jura red wine with the sweetbread – too dry and acidic.   The choice of music was also unorthodox – ‘90s and 2000’s alternative rock. So long as the volume is set right it was unproblematic, but it did occur to me that the rowdy music doesn’t necessarily compliment the fine dining we were undertaking.  But make no mistake – Kontrast is a fantastic place to go for a very nice meal. You will feel welcome, you will be well taken care of, and you will have the most wonderful meal. Be it friends, colleagues or couples, this place will cater to your every need and desire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r800708768-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2023-07-16,chloetula,"I told our waiter I would not leave a review, but I must warn others to stay away from tourist trap “La Table d’Hôtes”. I anticipate they will reply to this as they do to other negative reviews by placing the blame on one’s expectations with no accountability or offer to make anything better. There's no room to complain in the experience because you are sitting with ten strangers; we didn't want to ruin anyone's evening by being upset in front of them or abruptly leaving; I waited to complain until we were paying. The waiter did not apologize.  My husband and I live in the San Francisco area and have eaten at many Michelin and fine dining establishments, both in the US and abroad. I speak and understand some French, my husband does not, but I do not think that being fluent would have changed our poor experience.  First of all, I wish to be quite clear that this review is about the high-end La Table d’Hôtes, and not the brasserie upstairs. These restaurants being combined here is misleading.  When we arrived, the host confused our reservation and sat us at the brasserie, where we sat for awhile, unattended, before someone else came to our table, informed us a mistake had been made, and that we were supposed to be downstairs.  Our waiter had an unkempt appearance, with a wrinkled uniform and a gaudy name tag that seemed all very casual for a meal that would ultimately top 500€ for us.  The sommelier, in an equally unkempt polo and name tag (similar to McDonalds uniforms) who could not pour a pairing-size pour consistently all night with very little understanding of basic wine service etiquette, glasses on people’s lefts, rights, and not even all pre-set at the table when we sat down. There was a miscommunication and she thought my husband and I were sharing the pairing, which was corrected when she came back and gave my husband and I comically large pours. She proceeded to give us both extra booze all night because I think she wanted to get us drunk and thought we were uncultured Americans.  The pairing (75€ pp) featured the cheapest wines from top producers. It featured entirely white wines, with the exception of one red, which was a disappointment.  After the unimaginative appetizer of bread and butter, we were put on a video conference with Etchebest after watching a short, trailer for the restaurant. It was a strange, reality TV show experience.  The first course was where my path began to diverge due to my allergies, which - to the restaurant’s credit - were handled well. My husband was presented with a fried oyster, and a mollusk paste that resembled imitation crab. I got a burnt piece of root vegetable with a horrible combination of flavors in a foam. We ate, hoping it could get better.  Then, a tepid and salty mushroom soup.  Next, a small slice of tasteless foie gras enveloped in a brioche covering with a passion fruit sauce. It looked nothing like a recent picture of this dish that the restaurant posted on social media.  The fourth course was another diversion for me; I received two large pieces of a veal chop that were out of proportion with the fish that was presented to the other guests. My veal was cold, tough and dry. My husband’s fish was unseasoned and accompanied by inedible mussels that most people pushed around their plates.  The final main course was duck à l’orange, which may have been the only dish I may describe from our experience as tasty.  The two dessert courses were simply bad. A salted crumble with olives and chocolate mousse, accompanied by what I can only describe as a martini slushie. Then the final straw was a rancid burrata served with rocket and underripe strawberries.  Dining near the kitchen was noisy and underwhelming. I pity these young chefs who think they are achieving something by working under this self-important little man Etchebest.  The scratched Christofle silverware was a gimmick.  It certainly was a night at the opera, where one watched the performance of a dining establishment crash the lowest expectations. I'm embarrassed of our waste of time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r903607929-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,1,en

2022-05-15,great travels,"We anticipated an amazing experience at this very special place, but unfortunately it was disappointing.   First, I want to mention this experience is not suited for non-French speaking clients, and it would have been better if this information was noted as we booked this reservation.  The only person able to provide equal explanation in English as in French was the sommelier.  The experience is very long and feels dragged out.  We were promptly seated at 7:15 pm for dinner and did not have the first course served until 8:15.  The subsequent 4 courses were prepared and served more timely, until about 10:45 pm.  Then, the main chiefs left and we waited for another 45 minutes for pastry chiefs to serve the first dessert, followed by the second.  Right before midnight, we asked for the check, because we just had to leave.   The food itself was very well prepared and presented.  The asparagus, mushroom and foie gras were amazing, the fish was ok and we did not like the octopus course at all. The chocolate dessert was excellent.  The wines were mediocre, less than what we expected in this level restaurant, especially in Bordeaux.   This is quite pricey, and the expectation of special chiefs table concept is wonderful, if it would be executed properly.  The chairs are metal and not comfortable, especially sitting on them for 5 hours.  This whole experience would be much more enjoyable if it would take 3-4 hours and need to have better chairs and better wine.  Detailed explanations in English would help to attract non-French speakers. I would not recommend this and would not do this again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r838625686-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,3,en

2024-10-13,Jean Louis D,"After a very good welcome (invited at 7.15pm, we had to wait for all the guests to be present), we chained the dishes. Each dish is finished in front of us, showing some of the technicality. The catch is that too often there was a gap between the dish (lacking flavors) and the sides. Only 2 courses (out of 7) gave us pleasure, grilled octopus Basque condiment and elder sabayon, and cryogenic nougat pear soup. When discussing with the other guests, they were unanimous on grilled octopus and nougat, remaining divided on the rest of the meal. Picasso tomato (very graphic) to sauce with a brioche (very good) but unfortunately not accompanied by the flavors of the graphic plate. The mushroom pennes again very technical but the winey and alcoholic taste of yellow wine spoils the dish. The blue lobster cooked in salt vapour (minute cooking with Noilly Prat, very spectacularly), unfortunately not enough raised by a fish soup bouillabaisse style, the accompaniment offset from the dish but connected with the theme of Marseille, Ricard ice cream accompanied by peanuts and chips in the shape of a sardine bone...

2024-06-13,Rafael B,"We went there to enjoy the last meal of our honeymoon, and that was the last bodega on our schedule. As it is known for being a must-see in Mendoza, we couldn't let the experience be overshadowed by other bodegas, so we left Casa Vigil as the cherry-on-top of our trip.  It was all going pretty well. We were served great wines at the entrance, and the explanations given were very interesting from the start. Bear in mind we arrived around 2:30 pm; this is important.  We sat inside, as all the other tables outside were already occupied because it was a blue sky day and the sun was so comforting, and that's fine.  We asked for the 3-step menu, and I literally cried when I took my first bite of the entrée. The flavor and attention to all the elements of the dish were astonishing. We also ordered a 3-wine pairing since we wanted to just try the wines because we drank too much at the bodega before Vigil. We then ate the main course, and it was as delicious as I expected.  The servings are quite large, so we took some time before asking for dessert and asked the waiter, Horacio (which is also important to note since he was our waiter from the beginning until this moment and we had great service with him), if we could go out and take some photos. He said that was no problem at all. We stood up and went outside to check the sculptures and decorations, took several photos, and enjoyed some musicians playing with other Brazilian customers. It was indeed a great moment.  We then saw Horacio, who was accompanied by a group of people, probably starting a tour of the place, next to the reception. We stood there for a while for a hear, but he asked us to wait for the next tour that would happen in about 15 minutes. However, we were inclined to sit again and order dessert, so we did.  Now all the sadness, rush, and bad service started.  We were received at the table by a woman unbeknownst to us until then since we knew Horacio was on a tour, which made sense. But she started by saying something like, ""We didn't know where you were! We thought you'd left,"" like, why would I do this? Strange, to begin with. Don't they communicate with each other about the customers wanting to go outside and take pictures? But OK.  We sat, and the desserts were served, but not in the tranquil mood we had before. The waitress seemed to be in a rush to serve us the desserts and kept looking at us like we had to eat fast. There were people cleaning tables, and we guessed that they were preparing for dinner. This was around 4:30 pm. We finished our desserts calmly, just as we did with all the other courses. We paired them with the wines, and just after she saw we finished, she asked to take the plates away. OK then...  Almost every minute after that she kept asking if we wanted anything else, but I just ate, i wanted to check the menu, but not that time. And she did this like two or three times and we were then offered the bill. We hadn't finished drinking, nor had we had the opportunity to check the menu for anything else. We weren't properly advised that we had to leave because the kitchen would close, nor was there anything written or said that implied we should leave before 5 pm or something, but she brought the bill anyway, even though I didn't ask for it.  It was our last day, and paying in Argentina is not that simple, even more so after an expensive experience. While I was checking my bank account to make sure my card would go through smoothly, she appeared again asking what the payment method would be. I was still checking my stuff, and she came back less than 30 seconds after bringing the bill I didn't ask for.  We still had wine in our glasses; we hadn't finished our experience! What happened to cause this sudden change in behavior? I told her I needed more time, as I was still checking my accounts and finishing my wine, and she kind of rolled her eyes and said that we needed to come pay with her at the tienda, where the POS was.  What? Is this how one ends their Michelin experience? Bringing the bill without being asked, not being advised of the schedule or kitchen closing times? Being rushed to pay even though I hadn't finished the wine I paid for?  All went from wine to degraded vinegar when I was almost escorted by her to the tienda to pay, and she kept looking at me while I was paying. She said something like, ""I have to stay here to make sure of the payment,"" or something like this.  After the card went through, she thanked me and apologized. I was shocked at how bad this experience ended. Was I going to flee the cashier? What was she thinking when she was ""making sure"" of my payment?  I ended up crying in front of my wife. I didn't want our honeymoon to end on such a bad note. We were treated extremely well at the beginning, only to end in a hurry and be treated as untrustworthy by the waitress.  I asked to see the manager, and he wanted to give us some glasses of wine in exchange for the inconvenience, but I refused, as I believe this is not the way to address a problem like this. Instead, the importance of what I was telling him should be acknowledged, and steps should be taken to prevent such issues for future clients. He seemed like someone who didn't care enough to deeply analyze the situation and just wanted to get around the problem, not face it.  This is an honest review of a complete experience, and I hope it improves for future customers. They should explain their schedules better and not rush people out of such a prestigious restaurant, leaving them feeling guilty for taking too long to eat or feeling they wouldn't pay the bill...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312781-d10056473-r954969379-Casa_Vigil-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html,2,en

2024-04-03,morgan_marshall,"I’m sorry to have to rate my experience as a 3 out of 5 stars considering this restaurant has received so many stellar reviews. While the hospitality, service and ambience were great, it lacked a great food and wine delivery.  There was very little explanation given of the wines. I would have liked more of an explanation of the different grape varietals and the wine regions where they were procured. The waiter simply poured the predetermined samples and told us we could choose our favorite to have with our meal, which didn’t end up being the case.  For my entree I ordered the gnocchi, which wasn’t made in the traditional way. They were plated as potato balls and I was disappointed by this modern conceptualization of gnocchi.

Do you have any, I asked. The server responded with a tentative “give me a minute” gesture before disappearing. He returned in about 10 minutes with a 2012 red and a gesture of presentation. I apologized for putting him to the trouble given my presumption it was beyond my monetary pain threshold. Do not worry, he said.

2023-09-29,Michelle H,"What an amazing place. Six of us spent 3 hours enjoying a tasty 3 course lunch and basically bottomless flights of wine. We had a choice between 3 whites, 3 white/reds and 3-4 reds. I got the basic tasting with 3 reds, my husband ordered a tasting of reserve reds and one of the other couples ordered all whites. My wines were good. My husband's were amazing. Especially the Cab Franc. We started with an amuse bouche that was a full size item on the menu. The service was great. Staff was very attentive.

2023-08-25,shop4lauren,The bodega was stunning.   Unfortunately we did the tour at 7:30pm and it was cold so we did cut the tour a little short but then we did a 7 course tasting menu which was out of this world.  The wines were all amazing   And the dining room was great.  The only thing I would have like maybe a little bit dimmer to set a nice evening mood.  Our server Alexandra or she mentioned she also goes by Alex was superb.  She explained every course and was extremely gracious.  Our sommelier Thomas (not sure is I’m spelling it right) was extremely knowledgeable of all the wines and desiring each wine and the notes of the wine.  He truly helped us enjoyed every course.  It was the best service I have received in quite a long time.  We left feeling like we had made some lifelong friends.   A definite MUST    Not to be missed.

2023-03-29,Jsegal7,"Short version: this place is amazing.   We came with an 18-month-old toddler, 40 min early (thanks weird toddler sleep), and with grand aspirations for a tasting - and they over delivered.   - Took care of us with a glass of wine and early seating, way before our reservation - Gave us the best-possible table for a toddler (outside, mostly away from others, under a beautiful olive tree). (Note: I’m not sure there’s a bad table in the house. They’re super diverse - inside, outside, in corners, under alcoves - and kind of all awesome in their own right.) - The service was exceptional. Everyone was incredibly friendly, despite toddler shenanigans. Great vibes, great recommendations, attentive (despite us being out in a corner), just top tier.  - Food was really great. My ojo de bife is one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. Other weekends were solid-plus, no misses but no other spikes.  - We went big with the wine - doing the Single Vineyard pairing. It was a splurge, and suuuuper expensive, but (a) the wine was amazing, and (b) they really make it worthwhile - you won’t go wanting for wine. Zero regrets.   Overall: despite this being a giant machine of a place (170 tables?!) it felt intimate, the food and wine were great, the service was extraordinary, and the vibe was impeccable.

2022-12-15,martin w,"The welcoming at a beautiful location was amazing. I had a great glass of champagne in a cozy room. The dinner was served in a different room, where a movable heater had to be installed and the cold breeze had to be stopped. While aranging all of this, I had an interesting tour of the wine cellar. All fine...it is a very old building. They serve mainly local and seasonal food, which I very much appriciate. I selected a five course dinner, which started with four different starters, of which all of them were on the very sour side. The individual taste of each ingredients was noticeable on the tongue and palate for a very short time, if at all ...the only thing which lasted was the sour taste....till the next course....same again.. The main courses were ok, but far away from what I would call 3 michelin star quality. On all tables, next to me, people were eating a lot of bread offered aside.... if I write a lot ... real a lot. It seemed to be good, but thoughts are left behind! The service was impeccable. Andreas Caminada seems to be to busy to take care of his core business.

Incredible amuse-bouches served during the aperitif, each one more fun and enjoyable than the next which set us up for the dinner with great expectations. Then the dinner, great great food and so pretty too. However, wine waiter or sommelier, as was not clear, got the wine wrong twice. Service good but totally mechanical. When the chef came to the table at the end it reflected the service, seemed a chore rather than a pleasure, better not to come at that point.

We took the full menu (5 course) with accompanying wines (the men) and non alcoholic menu (the ladies). Also an interesting and unique proposal. The wines proposed were very unique and also an interesting discovery.  The quality, variety, fantasy in each plate was extraordinary from the beginning to the end.

2021-05-20,#rooftopfoodie,"A meal at Andreas Caminada’s flagship, triple started Schauenstein castle restaurant is for most of us a once in a lifetime experience but a truly perfect and unforgettable one. The experience starts with very moody, spot lights-lit tables and just the best restaurant staff I have ever come across. Guests are treated with wonderful attention, just as one would expect in perfection obsessed Switzerland.  The dishes are an homage to the area but put together with amazing creativity. The sweetbread surprise dish was just perfect. And when the steaming bread arrives with the sea salt butter, it’s culinary heaven. The wine pairings have certainly been given much and thorough thought but cold-served red wine might not be to every wine lover’s taste. But a new option is readily made available following every whim of the guests.  The meal certainly doesn’t come cheap but combined with the perfect experience provided, it is surely worth every penny and more.

2020-01-18,DvA,"Andreas Caminada is Switzerland's most famous chef, so of course we had heard a lot about his restaurant before we finally made it up to a remote little village in Grison for an extended lunch at Schloss Schauenstein. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We were overwhelmed by the quality and the creativeness of the food, even before we got to the first main course. Caminada starts his menu with plenty of outstanding amuse bouches and appetisers before serving several larger courses. He refrains from using posh ingredients like caviar, wagyu beef or foie gras. Instead, all the dishes are inspired by local produce and recipes. Nevertheless, the combinations of flavours are just heavenly. And on top of it, each plate looks like a wonderful piece of art. The cheese course is another highlight: next to an exclusive selection of Swiss and French cheese, a broad range of side dishes makes for an unmatched variety of exciting flavours to finish off the savoury part of the meal. Of course, there are several sweet courses too. The best of which, in our case, was an extremely fluffy and delicate milk soufflé. The staff is young, and maybe a bit insecure, but this hardly harms the overall experience. At the end of the visit, coffee, digestives and petit fours are served in an upstairs room of the ancient chateau. As the sun sets behind the Grisons mountains, you have all the time in the world to become aware of the breathtaking excellence in cuisine and hospitality you have just enjoyed. This is a restaurant experience second to none in Switzerland!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r739827077-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

The food was top notch, alltough i must say that if i only had to judge the food without the surroundings like service, ambiance, location, etc, i would feel that it was a tad overpriced as i had comparable/equal quality menus for a lot less.

2020-01-09,Joe_Black72,"I know... I promised in my past reviews I wouldn't have visited any more 3 Michelin star restaurants... But I did it again.   And result was the same.  3 Michelin stars -and Michelin star rates restaurants in general- are the most impersonal restaurants I know. No character,  no passion,  it seems they cook to get 3 stars.  In the old days instead,  you got 3 stars because you cooked.  Anyway....   Amazing location in one of the best cantons of Switzerland. Very nice atmosphere and very private dining rooms.  Chef Caminada may be a great food engineer,  no doubt about that,  but what he is totally missing in my view is the connection to the territory.   We are in a Canton full of great mountains... So why the hell do I need to feel Asian influence in my plates?  I wanna fell the mountains and its smell.  If I want to feel Asian I would go to an Asian restaurant!   The endless pre entrees tastings were just too much.  And, again,  this is a new fashion -probably requested by Michelin so that you can get stars-,  which never existed in the older days where the heavyweight was food and not its design.   I can't tenner any main dish I would order again.  But for sure I thought twice I was somewhere between Vietnam and Cambodia,  and not in fantastic Graubuenden.   Sweets were not amazing at all,  although perfect from the outside.   Wine list honestly disappointing. Even more disappointing was that I asked something to the Sommelier and he couldn't answer -and me,  I'm not a professor at all...  I just know a few things about wines!.   Even more disappointing was the cheese dish.  I asked only one thing to the cheese dish waiter and,  again,  he couldn't answer.  And my question was SO basic!  I couldn't believe it.   These 2 people,  with all due respect,  shouldn't be working at a 3 stars restaurant!  This shows exactly today's attitude.  Great plates,  great designs,  amazing engineering in the food...  And no substance behind that. No passion.  No heart.    As much as I like you,  dear chef Caminada, you won't see me back unless you so profound changes to your kitchen...  You may loose some stars if you do that,  but you may make many more clients happy and become special also without stars.

2019-10-05,Yuan Y,"Schloss Schauenstein is an institution in Switzerland: most people have to book (and maybe even save) several months in advance, many come to celebrate a special occasion, and most people who dine here probably also regularly visit other fine dining establishments... so the expectations are very high.  We came for lunch - which is what we would recommend, as the entire meal lasted 5.5 hours, and we didn't eat for 16 hours afterwards. We've ordered the 6 courses meal, and my friend also ordered the wine pairing. As expected, the food was world class. Andrea Caminada, clearly, is a culinary artist. Excellent produce, stunning presentation, beautiful flavors. We especially loved the langoustine which was one of the best dishes I have eaten in my life. You get a huge selection of snacks and amuse-bouches before the starters, and I loved the small booklet to take home which included our menu as well as some seeds to plant at home.   When you dine in a restaurant like Schloss Schauenstein, the service needs to be on a par with the food as it shapes your entire experience... you might not remember most of the dishes that you ate, but you will always remember how you felt when you were at the restaurant. In this regard, unfortunately, our expectations were not met.   - The restaurant offers a free pick-up from Thusis which is very nice. We were warmly welcomed by a cheerful young lady who knew our names and immediately made us feel like we were old friends.   - Schloss Schauenstein is a beautiful little castle, and all the surroundings are also very charming. We took our apéro with the first snacks on the pretty terrace, this is where we met our main server who didn't seem to like us very much. One of the various small snacks was a ""foie gras bonbon"" but because I had mentioned in advance that I don't like foie gras, I got a little tartlet as an alternative. My friend whispered to me that she had forgotten to mention that she doesn't like liver, so I asked the server if he could bring another tartlet, and the response was: ""The tartlet is the alternative for the person who had mentioned in advance that she does not eat foie gras."" (???) We did not get another tartlet, so I told her to eat mine.   - We only had 3 tables in our room with 4 other people, and we counted 8 servers in total. Most of them were very friendly and nice, except the aforementioned gentleman who was professional but we could tell that he did not warm up to us. Unfortunately, I didn't ask for his name so let's just call him ""Mr. X"" for this review.   - My friend got her first glass of wine and immediately said ""I can mostly smell dishwashing detergent"". She didn't say anything but when it happed again with the third glass of wine, she mentioned it and immediately got a new glass, but the waiter said that they had had the problem before and had tried various solutions... to no avail. If you have had this problem before, I just wonder why servers don't ""check"" glasses before pouring guests wine? At a restaurant of this calibre, you simply can't have glasses smelling of dishwashing detergent!   - Mr. X didn't seem very well-informed with regards to the wines. He would e.g. confuse Spanish and Italian wines, even though he was looking at the bottles when he introduced them.   - We absolutely loved the cheese course which came with various delicious snacks (cured meats, Maluns, a gorgeous panforte, tiny potatoes etc.). A lovely lady explained the different cheeses and put together a little selection for each one of us. At the end, she said that she'd be happy to come back if we'd like another piece of one of the cheeses. Because we loved the cheeses, we did want a little more cheese after we had finished. When we asked Mr. X, he was clearly not amused and told us, that the cheese cart was already gone but if we told him EXACTLY which cheese we wanted, he could MAYBE get us another small piece. I didn't remember the names of the cheeses that I wanted and because he seemed irritated, we just asked for the only one where we could remember details. At this point, our happy mood had vanished, because we felt like a nuisance.    - Our neighbors couldn't finish their bread and asked to take it home with them. The waiters brought out a new bread in a nice box for them (very nice gesture), and when I saw that, I said (more as a joke) ""ohhh, I want one too!"". Mr. X then looked at me with indignation and said ""SERIOUSLY?"".   - At one point, Mr. Caminada himself came out to say ""hello"". He was very professional but also seemed very reserved, it didn't feel like he enjoyed the interaction with the guests, and it was more of an obligation. Our neighbors celebrated their 22nd anniversary and had eaten at Schloss Schauenstein several times in the past. I would expect a Michelin*** restaurant to do something special for such an occasion, and I would expect the chef to know... but he didn't. The couple had to mention to him that they were here for their anniversary, Mr. Caminada said ""oh, congratulations"" and directly moved on to the next table.    - We went back to the terrace for our coffee/tea and the petit fours (beautiful!). I wanted to order a jasmine tea (which is not a very unusual tea choice), and Mr. X told me that they didn't have it, because ""nobody else orders it"". Slightly disappointing as I'm a tea sommelier and would expect at least the most common tea choices in a restaurant like this. We chatted with the lovely couple next to us (who were celebrating their anniversary), and they told us that they had ordered 3 courses for CHF 216 + an extra foie gras starter. What they didn't know, and what nobody told them, was, that the foie gras starter was CHF 95.- extra = they ended up paying CHF 311 for 4 courses, when the 6 courses meal was only CHF 270.   All in all, our experience confirmed why Andreas Caminada is one of the best chefs in the country: All his accolades are well-deserved, and the food was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the service was not. When I pay this kind of price for a meal, I expect the staff to go the extra mile to ensure that I have a fabulous experience, and I want them to HAPPILY bring me whatever I want. I want the same attention to detail which has been poured into all of the dishes which we ate that day. It's just such a pity that so many people work hard to create an experience for the guests but at the end of the day, you will mostly remember the weakest link...   We went to IGNIV the next day and had a better time there: While the food was in our opinion on a similar level, the service was so much warmer, and we felt truly taken care of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r715578014-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,4,en
2019-09-22,travelin_tommy,"My wife and I had a wonderful, but costly, experience dining here. The service was impeccable. The ambience was terrific, sitting on the terrace for apperitivi and snacks and later for coffee and dessert, as well as inside for our lengthy meal (since we chose to have multiple dishes from the menu rather than choose a la carte). There were multiple samples of amuse bouche as well as desserts served with the coffee, not counting the multiple different dishes on the menu. Frankly, we did not have any that we thought were less than very good, many were excellent, and also many were surprising in taste combinations we had not previously had nor considered. We have eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants; sometimes we have questioned their stars, but not the three stars awarded here. My only quibble was with the drinks: everything was very expensive. Wine on their selected list to compliment the meal was good but not really exceptional. Furthermore, comparing the price of two wines with which I was familiar on the list of their wines showed a mark-up of >3 times the price easily available elsewhere. My guess is that they make their profit on the wines to pay for the excellent service and food preparation that we experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r711964898-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

2019-07-19,Kellytx78,"My husband and I knew we wanted to take a fabulous trip to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had no idea where we wanted to go though. We love tasting menus so he did some research (shocking!!) and he discovered this amazing hotel & restaurant. We booked our entire trip around this hotel and restaurant. It was definitely worth it. We booked a night at the hotel in the castle and had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived to the train station in Thusis, we had a really kind woman (I can't remember her name though..) pick us up in an Audi A8 which of course my husband loved. She drove us to the castle and the minute we pulled up, I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew from the pictures that it was going to be incredible, but pictures don't do it justice. It is GORGEOUS! The grounds, the flowers, the castle...everything is picture perfect. Check in was super easy and she gave us a tour of the property so we knew where everything was. There are so many adorable little nooks and places on the property for various activities. I won't like - there were so many that I forgot them all! We went to the pool area for awhile, went to the beautiful lawn across from the castle, went to the terrace, went to another outdoor terrace for a few drinks....it was all just perfect. It was so quaint and beautiful, yet really welcoming which was nice. When we got back to our room (we stayed in the Kastanie which has low ceilings, just FYI if you are traveling with anyone tall) and got settled in. The room is so charming. We loved it. Staying in the hotel was the perfect setting too. Anyway, we got a knock on our door while I was getting dressed in the bathroom, but it was the chef's wife! She explained there was a little issue with another hotel guest and the guest needed a special room to accommodate a health concern. My husband and I were happy to move rooms, so we packed our stuff and headed downstairs to the lobby. On our way down, we passed Marco (more about him later) and he was determined to carry our luggage for us, but my husband refused to let him. He was so kind and really wanted to carry it, but my husband is stubborn. Ha! Anyway, we ran into Sarah and Enna (I think that was how it's spelled) on the stairs. Enna oversees the dinner service I believe. They explained that the guest had solved their issue by switching with another couple they were with so we didn't have to change rooms after all. Sarah was soooo apologetic and kind, and we could tell she felt really bad about us packing our stuff. We really didn't mind though and we told her it was completely fine. I joked with her and told her I just wanted to meet her husband because I had researched the restaurant and the hotel and was seriously fascinated and inspired by him. She said she'd gladly tell him to come meet us during dinner. Needless to say, I was really excited. We got dressed, and headed to one of the loveliest rooms for the Apertif. Words can't explain the beauty of this room. The ceiling detail was stunning and so beautiful. The walls were painted with these gorgeous paintings. I can't even describe it because it's simply stunning, but in a very charming and welcoming way. My favorite colors are pink and green and there were accents of them in the room, which also was just so pretty! They seated us at a small table and greeted us with a glass of complimentary champagne from Sarah. It was really nice of them. They also took our picture for our anniversary which was a perfect momento from our evening. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I won't go into detail, but the dinner was AMAZING. It was absolutely the most exquisite dinner we've ever had. It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. Marco was one of our main servers and he was the best. He was funny, charming, so kind and really made our experience an even better one. All of the service team was very nice. He and Alexander were the ones who really made the best impression because they were so friendly. We are from Texas and like to talk so they were really nice to talk to us. I could tell they read their diners really well because a few other diners didn't seem as chatty as we were and they weren't as chatty with them. Anyway, they were great. Towards the end of our dinner, Chef Andreas came to our table and talked to us. He was so friendly and it was surreal. I'd read so much about him so the fact that he comes and introduces himself and thanked us was so impactful. He greeted all the tables, but I asked him if I could take a picture with him and he said he'd be happy to. We went to the lobby, snapped a pic and mentioned to him that it would be great if he was around the next day so we could get a picture of him with something we'd brought (something from my husband's job which wouldn't make sense unless you're from Texas). He said he'd be around in the morning and to let the front desk know when we were available. We said bye, got a cocktail to go and walked outside to the terrace to look at the beautiful grounds again. They're illuminated at night and it's like a fairy tale. The next day, we went to breakfast (which was soooo good. The croissants are the best I've ever had) and then we strolled around again and decided to stop at the Casa Caminada (his newest hotel property on the grounds which is a little more casual). It was really cool and obviously didn't have the history of the castle, but it was really beautiful, yet trendy, yet classic. Hard to explain. The floors are awesome though. Anyway, there is a bakery in there and a coffee area in the restaurant so we got a cup of coffee and went to sit outside. We had mentioned to the front desk that if Sarah or the Chef was around and available, that'd be great, but no worries if not. We didn't really think they'd come by, but about 5 minutes later, they did! We chatted for a bit, took another picture and Chef went to go about his day, but Sarah talked to us for a while. She is wonderful. If you get a chance to meet her, definitely do because she's one of the kindest women I've ever met. She and I had a lot in common because of kids, etc. so it was really nice talking to her and learning more about the hotels and IGNIV. If you don't know about it, look it up for sure.  After a lovely chat with her, it was time for us to go back to the train station. I was so so sad to leave because it was just incredible, but it was the PERFECT anniversary in the perfect location. It's breathtaking and the food can't even be put into words. Simply put - if you're planning a trip to Switzerland, you MUST stay at this castle and dine at the restaurant. If you aren't planning a trip, do it because you won't regret it and you'll make memories that will last a lifetime. They made such a great impression on us and we absolutely cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r690892599-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

Take the way through the garden, the view in the castle is breathtaking. The staff do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable, it’s a balance act between top class food and down to earth atmosphere in a castle that’s one of a kind. Hardly ever have I enjoyed a lunch lasting over 4:30hrs and wished for more.  Hint: if it’s warm/sunny, try having the aperitif on the terrace, even better on the tower.  The food, well it’s a piece of art and I won’t try comparing it to anything because I just do t have the words for it.

2019-02-13,MarinMarais,"I was really looking forward to dinner at Schloss Schauenstein and in the end, it was mostly what could be expected from an evening at a star restaurant. Attentive and knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, high level of complexity in courses and an interesting wine pairing. The most disappointing course was the cheese which I found unremarkable in taste and in which I believe made my stomach sour at the end of the evening. I could appreciate the time and care that goes into creating, preparing and serving a multitude of complexities on a dish, but in the end, it’s a long evening (from 19.00-almost 23.30 when we finally finished dessert in the main dining room) of hodgepodge different courses that don’t necessarily go together or complement each other. I was looking for more harmony in what was presented. I’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, this was the first 3* and I would hope that 3* and the prices that go with it would warrant something especially creative or special but it wasn’t my opinion of the evening at the Schloss. Everything was executed to an extremely high standard but it just failed the wow factor for me, it was just lacking soul. I left thinking that the price wasn’t worth the evening. It’s a pure question of taste, of course, as the quality is definitely there, but for me it was just a technically ambitious variety show of amouse bouche, tasting dishes and desserts. The expectations for a 3* restaurant are probably unreasonable, but I think the main reason people are drawn to these restaurants is to leave feeling inspired in one way or another by the chef’s creativity.  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I suspect that Caminada’s taste is perhaps just not my taste, and that’s ok, because it seems he impresses and inspires more than enough people!

So, yes, visiting Schloss Schauenstein is a MUST. The “but”, though is related to the staff.

2018-12-09,HansM,"Of course, it is an expensive place to go to - but still, it is great value for money - and the wines are have better prices than in many less exclusive restaurants! For me, a restaurant has to satisfy me in three dimensions: Food - Ambiance - Staff and Andreas Caminada and his team make sure that all these dimensions are taken care of. You really feel welcome and at home, there are no stiff upper lips or french-style waiter snobbishness, everything goes easy but, as you can expect, is highly professional. This time round, we were very happy with the food which had the seasonal touch of fall-winter, but was still colorful and presented a happy contrast to the weather outside. Leave room for the cheese board which is full of excellent specialties from the region and even comes with some small blue local potatoes. Ms Junge does an excellent job with the wines. And last but not least, this is the restaurant where the chef shows presence, bids farewell to the guests. Overall, again a great experience.

Most striking of the restaurant is the relaxed atmosphere. We took our time browsing through the menu an the extensive wine menu. We asked many questions, but never did we detect any impatience.  As can be expected, all amuses and courses are excellent. Tastes are superior and most dishes have a nice ‘bite’. This is something we sometimes miss in restaurants in this league.

2018-08-02,malli42,"As mentioned in my other tripadvisor comments, this year we chose Andreas Caminada and the restaurant Schauenstein as our yearly 3* experience.   And also in a nutshell, overwhelming. This comments reflects also the hotel experience... from the first contact up to the last view there is absolutely nothing to complain about.   Hotel: We stayed in the room ""Wasser"", which is a double room located at the top of the main building. As we arrived pretty early a very nice host showed us everything and explained all facilities and possibilities. You have to imagine, that this is a relatively small castle, but there are hints and secret corners to relax, to sunbath, to crab some food & wine - simply to enjoy. Many thanks to the complete staff. But if you are interested to stay here, please have a closer look before choosing a room. In our room the shower was a bathtub in the middle of the room, the toilet was separated with translucent glass. Actually we liked it.   Restaurant: As many others wrote, marvellous. The weather was great, so we started with the aperitif and small snacks on the beautiful terrace. Here we also enjoyed the last glass of wine and petit fours after the marvellous dinner. Between these two delicacies we were faced a incredible genius menu, based only on local food (and it is incredible what is possible with this local stuff). Ok, two courses were weak compared to the others. But this is highly depend on personal taste. Last but not least not to forget the highly professional - but always with a twinkle in their eyes - staff.

The place is extremely overpriced for what they offer - olives soaked in olive oil with a weak ""citrus"" condiment; oysters on the half shell with possibly the most boring sauce ever (green mamão vinagrete), raviolis no better than anything you'd get at Eataly, meat you could do yourself at home, pork with lots of fat in it - the Chef's ego is bigger than his creations. I will never return, service was weak and they suggested 14% when standard tips in São Paulo are 10%.

Small house with modern design, very nice decor and lots of room between tables so you do not feel cramped.  Very friendly staff, casual service.  Food is ok. For me the starters and mains were ok but not really good. Only the mushrooms were delicious. The codfish Salad was not very tasty. The pork rib was very greasy and not tender.   But what was really excellent: the desserts, the French toast was excellent, crunchy and extremely tasteful. And the Pingado, similar to Tiramisu, was absolutely delicious.  Small wine list.

2020-02-23,Kathleen M,"Too many Michelin-starred properties with public chefs seem to have lost the one main ingredient necessary to any good meal...joy.  Joy in the cooking, joy in the serving and joy in the eating.  Tuju got the last two out of three correct...but with a center kitchen on full display, the first joy was blatantly missing.  Yes, food is important, and with a 12-course tasting dinner with paired wines, there are a lot of details that could possibly get missed, but kids, come on, it's food! Enjoy it!  Tabled in front of the finishing kitchen watching the 12 or so young professionals cooking and plating, I felt that I was witnessing a religious rite...all choreographed and all so, so serious.  To be fair, this appeared to be a reflection of Chef Ralston, who visited the kitchen several times to insure the creations were perfect...and they were.... seriously perfect.  Chef Ralston, and his executive chef Rhaiza, have created a beautiful and serene space in which to explore his seasonal take on Brazilian cuisine. And 'his take' is delicious, intriguing, sometimes challenging, and overall a delight; and one that I would love to revisit as the seasons change, however... My visit to Tuju was a highlight of a Pinheiros neighborhood food tour, unfortunately, it wasn’t the acme. And it could have been with just a hint of joy-in-the-doing emanating from the kitchen.

2019-09-26,Michael U,"Following the trail blazed by D.O.M., TUJU by Chef Ivan Ralston pushes modern Brazilian Cuisine forward by not specifically showcasing local Ingredients, but reinterpreting the world through Brazilian eyes inside his Restaurant at Rua Fradique Coutinho 1248.  Open since 2014, and recently the recipient of a second Michelin Star, it is after passing through a hushed hallway that guests find themselves inside Ralston’s “kitchen theater,” a staff fluent in English leading guests to polished wooden tables that extend back towards the bar and urban garden on the patio.  A quiet and focused space in Vila Madalena, everything from TUJU’s design to Cocktail list indicative of a Chef who has spent time researching both technique and his culture, guests visiting for the first time are encouraged to partake in Ivan’s “Season Menu,” the carte blanche taking into account allergies and dislike but otherwise consisting of thirteen courses served across two hours.  Trained in the kitchens of Maní, RyuGin and Mugaritz, the latter identifiable in modernist spins on local Produce, it was while sipping on a strong drink of Gin and sweetened Acid that course one arrived, sliced and aerated Pumpkin forming the background for Peas and Citrus with herbs that carry over nicely to a “Taco” comprised of sweet Crab and shaved Corn wrapped in Nasturtium.  Continuing light with translucent Shrimp swimming in vibrant Broth, its follow-up a comparison of local River Mussels to those from the Atlantic bathed in Manioc Root Juice, fans of Uni will be stunned by tender Tongues amidst a tangle of Leeks with Parsnip Cream while torched Cauliflower finds itself the centerpiece of a thick Sauce that tastes something like Mole mixed with Soy.  Shifting back to Seafood, a tender Tentacle obtained through Chef Ralston’s relationship with local fisherman accented in umami, one would be hard-pressed to name a more interesting *looking* dish than Arapaima Fish in Seaweed Pil Pil, the combination of snappy Flesh and Skin Crisps equally tantalizing alongside Artichokes and Bean Sprouts.  Completing savories with grilled Tuna and two types of Palm plus unsweetened Açaí, a diversity of textures seeing the best bites those that incorporate a little of each into a single forkful, it is by way of Cheese that the palate is transitioned, the Blue and Parmesan-mimic particularly impressive, as too was housemade Bread and Butter plus the bright green Fruit described as a Fig.   Not scaling back on sweets, Dessert number one perfuming stewed Berries with Mint in a makeshift Sundae, it was while Coffee dripped tableside that a tangy Yogurt Parfait dazzled, the Pour Over subsequently enjoyed with housemade Chocolates filled with everything from Dulce de Leche and Cashew Fruit to Garlic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r713116135-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en

2018-12-15,CaliGirlSAS,"My husband and I had the pleasure of experiencing the phenomenal culinary journey of the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairing and we were blown away.  Don’t listen to any reviews that say that there is no soul or flavor in the food. It’s quite the opposite - we felt that the complexity of the depth and layers of flavor was perfectly executed and also appropriately balanced for each course from start to finish. We each experienced varying levels of umami moments throughout the evening and enjoyed the uniquely Brazilian ingredients that we would never get to experience anywhere else.   The portions were well thought out.  I’ll have to admit that we were a bit intimidated with the idea of 12 courses but by the end we didn’t feel too full or heavy - just happily satisfied.   I’ll also note that I’m vegan and my husband doesn’t eat pork. They had no problem accommodating our dietary restrictions. We also had the privilege of speaking with Chef Ivan Ralston towards the end of our meal - he was such a lovely presence and it was clear from our discussion that he’s in pursuit of excellence and innovation through his craft.   We’ve eaten at Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and have sometimes been disappointed with some restaurants’ tasting menus given that one or more courses may end up being bland or weaker than the others. That was not the case here - each course was impressive. That’s quite a feat for 12 courses!  For all of the reasons noted above, we feel that this place deserves 3 stars instead of 2!

At Tuju, the by-the-glass offerings were outstanding, among the best I have seen in Brazil. Our server was also very intent on making sure we enjoyed the experience, going so far as offering a (very good) chocolate tasting to my chocolatolic wife, free of charge. Finally, we loved the dessert.  The first thing that bothered us was their timing. Shortly after we ordered the meal, the server brought us some butter, olive oil, and salt – but no bread. We waited and waited. Some 10 minutes later, the bread arrived. They claimed that it took so long because it was being warmed up. Yet we have been to many other places that serve warm bread without such delay.  We have been to a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Brazil and abroad, many I have reviewed on TA. Something we always enjoyed at such establishments was being surprised by the unusual flavors, textures, and looks. Tuju mostly failed at this.   Our first course was a broccoli-based appetizer (Broccoli in miso marinade, cauliflower, and walnuts). It had a fancy name and description and the texture was interesting. But the taste was rather bland.  They were out of the second course, white clam. We opted then for octopus (my wife) and a couscous (myself). My wife enjoyed the tender texture of the octopus, but was unimpressed with the rest. I felt my couscous was nothing special as well.  The first main dish was a fish coated with its own roasted and ground scales, rather good. It was well prepared, delicate and very enjoyable.  The second main dish was a wagyu beef rib, with manioc flour and bacon bits. We were both unimpressed, unfortunately.  The dessert was called a corn-meal brioche, but in fact it was pain perdu, and a very good one at that. It came with salt caramel and peanut ice-cream. It was by far the best course.  In spite of the friendliness and proactivity of our server, we felt that overall service lacked the professionalism and confidence a place of this caliber requires.  The overall impression we had was that in spite of the elaborate descriptions and well-designed settings, the dishes fell short of our expectations. We asked ourselves how Tuju could have been rated a two-star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r585854760-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,3,en

2018-03-08,gibbyone,"The food at Tuju was fantastic and definitely the highlight of our trip. We did the 12-course tasting and each course was beautifully presented. Every bite danced on your pallette. Ingredients were fresh. Unique flavors were expertly combined to compliment each other. Some of the highlights were: the frozen infused watermelon cubes with cucumber and buttermilk, manioc tortilla with smoked beets, crunchy chicken and the lychee with thyme cream was out of this world. Staff was attentive and knowledable and capable of describing dishes and wine in English. The seating and lighting could be improved for more ambience -- the seating was a little stiff and the lighting was a little too bright. Cocktails were also excellent, but the wait for them was a bit longer than it should have been. Pricing was typical for a tasting of this size and caliber. I was also impressed that they offered a shorter tasting menu should you choose not to go all in. Eating is a wonderful way to discover a city and Tuju helped give Sao Paulo five stars. I would put this place on your must-do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r565284199-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en

It is nice but sooo overpriced for the ingredients. I cook ( not even close to a chef, just making a point about ingredients, complexity etc) and I felt the menu lacked the “wow” effect.   Most of us chose the 12 course tasting menu. One couse was split pea soup. Come on!!!!   The drinks were good, We were impressed by the mixology. Desset was ok.  The cachaça ice cream was really really good. But 400 for  just one good dessert and a good drink is too much in my opinion.  I recommend  going for the experience.

2024-10-14,Susan in Toronto,Beautiful room on the second floor of a barn like structure.  The meal was excellent - we did the wine pairing as well which was very generous.  While the experience was excellent we will likely not return - did not feel it was worth the money we paid and we would have appreciated more local Ontario items on the menu.    We were provided with a menu at the end but it would have been better to have it at the beginning so you could refer to it as you were eating - the servers explained each meal but by the time they left the table we had forgotten most of the ingredients.  And the $6 charge for tea left a bad taste given what we had paid for the meal - surely the restaurant can afford to absorb that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r973893130-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en
2024-10-05,cctyu68,"With weather still unseasonably warm and comfortable, it is nice to take advantage and venture outside of the normal GTA core for an occasional chowdown or two. For me, PM is the only trusted out-of-town, fine dining establishment featuring a tasting menu option that is within reasonable driving distance from home. Most of all, their offering reflects the quintessential in ‘ farm-to-table’ dining, incorporating a total culinary package that is always consistent, assuring and exceptional…..and now the trademark of a double Michelin Red and Green stars recipient!  It has been almost a year since I last drove out to PM and savored the wonderful and ever-changing creative cuisine of PM’s ‘ dynamic duo chefs ‘ - Daniel Hadida and Eric Robertson…….not to mention visiting their flocks of free range chicken and ducks, grass fed cattles and the impressive vegetable and herb garden!  For the past three decades, due to the close proximity of our birthdays, my brother-in-law and I had been holding regular annual, husband-only, joint birthday bashes at different venues all over Ontario and Quebec. Fine dining establishments with tasting menus and wine pairing offerings were our preferred venue options. This year, meeting our primary criteria with ease, we decided to pay PM a long overdue re-visit! Our luncheon culinary experience started off with a walk around the restaurant complex, a close encounter with some free-run ‘ Silken Chicken ‘ and a sampling of Chardonnay grapes from the 2024 harvest! Very ripe and sweet! IMHO, it could be a very good vintage year!  As in the past, after climbing the challenging ‘32 steps‘ flight of stairs to the spectacular upper level dining room, we were welcomed warmly by both chefs, outside of the open-kitchen. This time, with added significance, since we are shaking hands with Michelin star chefs!  In light of growing health and safety concerns, we have decided to pass on the wine pairing option. In lieu of, we both settled for a glass of their house-special Champagne plus a glass of their very aromatic, 2019 ‘ Irreverance ‘ ( Orange Riesling, Chardonnay & Gewurztraminer ). The creative dishes of our 12-course ‘Omakase’ tasting menu were visually impressive and relishing. The masterful menu was well thought of and conceived, featuring a balanced and diverse offering of dishes with a focus on seafood and pasture raised fowls and animals. Most dishes feature major components with complex and multidimensional taste profiles, augmented with an interesting array of vegetable sides. The ‘ too beautiful to disturb and eat ‘ artful plating elevated to an even higher level than before. Again, some never before seen or tasted, uncommon ‘organic‘ ingredients adorned our plates ( eg., local ‘Golden’ Strawberries, ‘Autumn’ Petit Pois! )……the advantage of owning a herb/vegetable garden and close proximity to local farms! To reflect their recipient of the Green Star, I was told by the chefs, ALL ingredients used from now on, especially the vegetables, will be organically grown either in-house or locally. The protein, local, organic, wild or free run!  Coupled with impeccable, warm and friendly front-of-house service and care, our near perfect meal was once again foodie and praise worthy. My ONLY very minor and superficial criticism pertains to the slight ‘overhanded‘ use of salt in the delectable sauces of a few dishes….the Lobster, the Cod and the Duck. No big deal! Part of living in an imperfect world!!  Looking forward to returning for the Fall menu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r972722789-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en

Service as would be expected excellent, attentive, very knowledgeable staff, professional yet friendly and relaxed. Happy to talk at the table with confidence. Dishes were presented by both chefs and servers, i love to see the kitchen involved in the service, all showed pride and excitement with their food.  Worth noting no full bar only a limited range of certain spirits... no mixers. However you go to PM for the food, ranked in Top 5 restaurants in Canada so I had high expectations and as Jools had visited in Summer last year and been blown away, I was expecting something special. Did i get it?? Sorry, not quite. Yes there were 3 or 4 real stand out dishes of the 10 course tasting menu, but it just did not live up to the hype. Was it due to it being winter and the seasonal produce available?  Look, experience was still very good, just not great. Stand outs... Bision Tartare, wow, melt in the mouth, lovely flavor. Nubian Goat, tender, strong flavor. Rasberry Sobet in Meringue, gapow!! Intense flavor, crispy meringue.  But then course 10, a ""Babka"", a nice Babka but what was it doing at the end of the meal, too heavy, poor menu planning, I'd have left it as a nine course tasting menu.

2023-10-08,dale t,"Pre covid we use to frequent this restaurant, it was very good back then! Advance forward to present day!  Rated in the top 100 restaurants in Canada the last couple of years, however did they pull that off with the meal we were served!?? Drunk food critiques? Paid off food critiques?? From start to finish we had excellent service! Provided you could hear them or understand them explaining the dishes they served you. A 10 course meal, I had my friend all hyped up about this new restaurant for her to try……unfortunately I felt embarrassed for bring her there for an evening that was suppose to be a magical food experience but still was an expensive comedy relief for us to enjoy each others company and guess which one of the servers cooked the dish that was being served to us! For it certainly could not possibly been a chef!  Possible a chef with a head cold because there was very little flavour in anything! The pork dish served was so tough you had a hard time cutting it and then chew chew chew …. A dish served with “Hogget” what is Hogget you may ask? It is a lamb that is to be between 12-18 months old….my guess it was old enough to vote! It was so tough you could not cut it, and then it came down to chew and swallow , or chew and spit out! A dish with Geoduck in it ….unfortunately mine had a bit of grit in it, probably sand….flash back of sand box at preschool …. There was not one dish that you would say OMG that was incredible! Although I did get my friend to say it by asking her to close her eyes when tasting one of the sauces and said picture campbells cream of mushroom soup, to which she replied OMG the chef must be standing back laughing his ass off at all these people eating this campbells soup! To which we both burst out laughing. Thank goodness we could laugh because at a price tag of $492 for the two of us , with no alcohol …we needed some humor for the wasted evening! If you could live on sour dough bread you will make out fine! The bread was the best part of the meal, and had most of the flavour!

2023-06-07,kameezel,"I wanted to be blown away by this experience and was not. It was very, very good, but not great, and definitely not spectacular. The food was tasty, beautifully presented, and appropriately priced for what it was but nothing made me think omg, this is the best thing ever. When we do a tasting menu like this, I expect at least one of those moments. there was also a missed opportunity for an amuse bouche and final dinner sweet with the bill which is pretty standard for meals like this, in my experience. The service was wonderfully friendly, but not stellar -- towards the end of the meal we had three sets of empty wine glasses on the table which wasn't terrible, but not expected for a venue of this quality and reputation.  I have to comment on the wine pairings because I tried to get some advance info on them from reviews and wasn't very successful. If money is no object, by all means it was interesting and I'm sure we tasted some things we'd not find elsewhere. But 6 2oz glasses of wine which were tasty and well matched, but not exceptional, for $135 is nuts. We didn't look at the regular wine menu because this was a special occasion and we'd decided in advance to do the pairings,  so I can't say what wine by the glass (or even bottle) cost, but my recommendation would be to have a look at the wine menu and get the sommelier to suggest 2 or 3 glasses to match the menu. The space itself is lovely and spacious, and having service included in the prices is a really nice touch. Again, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience -- it was a lovely night out, and I have no regrets, but it was not a life changing meal, and I've had those for a similar or lower price. I hope this is helpful for anyone who is waffling about making a reservation or choosing to go with the wine pairings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r893930315-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,4,en

2022-10-27,travellingdining,"This is Pearl Morissette's last month outdoors under their tent and we were glad to have experienced it. Prepared for a chilly evening, we found the tent to be pleasantly warm (even without the available blankets) and very inviting. What was greenery spreading over the ceiling in summer, is now delicately dried and brown--but it suits the fall weather and candlelit atmosphere.  Servers and staff are well-trained and attentive, pleasant and very accommodating. Due to an allergy at our table (they asked at time of booking), the kitchen had prepared special dishes without certain ingredients (eggs & milk). In one case, the altered dish was better than the original!  That said, all the food was terrific-- imaginative, complementary flavour combinations created using as much local product as possible, including many ingredients grown on the farm surrounding the restaurant. Even with ingredients like sablefish (aka black cod) which can sometimes have an overwhelming taste, the fusion of flavours was excellent.  The wine list is extensive, although we opted for the wine pairing. Our sommelier was well-versed and interested in giving us the best experience possible. She even changed up one pairing to something she thought we would better enjoy, based on our comments as dinner went on.

Their dishes are creative, the flavour combinations are unique and the plating is lovely. The wine pairings are perfect; a combination of local and international vintages were excellent complements to the food. The servers are polite, unobtrusive and pleasant. Such care is taken with allergies (they ask in advance), that the chefs redesign some dishes to accommodate food sensitivities at a particular table.  We ate outdoors in the enclosed tent, which was comfortable and warm, despite the near freezing weather that night.

I’m a foodie and unfortunately this experience was just a check mark on my “bucket list”.  Good service and great atmosphere, very romantic. The food portions were small. I mean really small. One of the courses was two tiny baby potatoes. I don’t expect a place like that to have big portions, but you do want to feel at least half satisfied after a meal. We though since it was nine course meal we’d feel different towards the end but then the deserts came and we were disappointed.  I’m very picky when it comes to food and I liked most dishes but there were few that I didn’t. The duck was a bit too rare, very chewy. It is just my opinion but all four of us thought ot would be nice if it was cooked just a bit longer.  I feel bad giving this place 3 star review because had good time.

2017-06-06,Andrew D,It is simple. You can not find better in the area for a romantic dinner or business lunch. The wine list is incredible and recommend to ask for advice. The quality of the food deserves at least 2 michelin stars and i would give it a good 17 out of 20 in the gault millaud. It seems difficult to find but not really. It is only 10 minutes from the motorway and a good gps will find it. This family run business is the proof that some people still respect good produce and know how to cook it. Price wise it is more than affordable and well worth the trip. ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r491015738-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html,5,en
2017-03-17,Silvana_worldcitizen,"This one-star restaurant deserves a visit, but you need to find your way there as it is located in the countryside at the crossing of Campania, Apulia and Basilicata, 15 minutes drive from the motorway exit (Vallata). The food is, expectedly, excellent and innovative, though deeply rooted in traditions (carpaccio, coffee risotto, ravioli with burrata cheese are absolutely a must). We chose the tasting menu, in order to have a feel of the chef's skills, but you can order a' la carte. The atmosphere is warm and cosy and the praise-worthy service discrete.

Prosecco and ethereal Zucchini Blossoms, house made bread perhaps best in Italy, house made onion enhanced bread sticks, mixed platter (house made ricotta fresca, local meats), all house made pastas (burrata ravioli with local black truffles, laccettini with white ragout of rosemary and rabbit), roasted pig on white eggplant base, pre-desert and desert, all with local Fianno di Avellino wine.

2012-02-20,TonyDeeEngland,"Whenever I visit the region of 'Campania' in Italy I always make a point of a special journey to Oasis Sapori Antichi for either lunch or dinner.  Forget any fine dining experience you've had in the past (and I've had a few all over the world), in my humble opinion these guys are 'Simply the Best'! Their taster menu with wine is a delightful gastranomic journey of the locality employing the finest locally sourced produce prepared and executed with passion and an uncompromising level of attention to detail. I can't speak highly enough of this establishment as they easily put other restaurants of much higher acclaim to complete shame. From the welcome to the service to the in-depth explanations of the dishes and the charming attitude and elegance of the owners it can only be described as a dreamy experience which I hope to repeat many more times again before the good Lord calls me to rest. I can think of no other place that checks if the timings between courses are acceptable and when the owner said to me 'consider yourself at home' I nearly fell off my rather splendid chair. Well done to the owners for creating such a wonderful and inspirational dining experience in the middle of nowhere which is nothing short of 'GENIUS'. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r124860582-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html,5,en
2011-12-05,Lucy G,"During the past couple of years many travel and gastronomic magazines have been praising the southern Italian region of Puglia-the heel of the boot--as the ""second Tuscany"". While especially nice for its delicious food and lovely beaches, Puglia is off the beaten track of Rome, Florence, and Venice, and not easily accessible by air except to Bari.  In fact the best way to get there is by car from Rome or Naples.  The drive from Rome to Bari takes approximately five hours and from Naples on A 16 autostrada about half that.  Moreover, you will need a car once you've arrived in Puglia.  A special place to break the trip is for lunch at ""Oasis Antichi Sapori"", owned and run by the extremely hospitable Fischetti family, in Vallesacarda.  To reach this special destination, exit the autostrada at Vallata, go uphill to the stop sign, turn left and go  straight for c. 6 kilometers or c. 4 miles until the sign for Vallesacarda where you turn right and go downhill until ""Oasis Antichi Sapori which will be on your left. Vallesacarda is an ugly  town but elegant, peaceful and very reasonably-priced ""Oasis Antichi Sapori"" lives up to its name. It was recommended to me by food writer Faith Willinger who is an expert when it comes to Italian cuisine.  Most of the dishes, including the ice creams, are made inhouse.  Mamma Giuseppina and sisters Maria Luisa and Michelina are in the kitchen.  Younger brothers Carmine, Puccio, and Nicola serve their creations and recommend the wines to accompany them.  Sister-in-law Raffaella and several members of the next generation also help in the dining room. There are five different menus to choose from;  a la carte, a multi-course Tasting Menu 55 euros/75 with wines, Old-Fashioned Meal 45euros/ 65 with wines, Only First Courses 35euros/55 with wines and on weekdays Business Lunch 19 euros.  I heartily recommend the home-made ravioli in a walnut and burnt garlic sauce, the candele (home-made short pasta) with codfish and baby green pepper sauce, and the roast suckling pig with spring onions and ginger.  The platter of local cheese and the homemade hazelnut ice cream are to die-for.  The wine list especially the choices from local cantine is impressive.

For the last few years, I've devoted myself to eating at fancy names. Obviously expensive. Bottura, Gennarino Esposito, Spouse, Niko Romito and another in Marche 3 stars that I do not remember. Putignano is considered the number 1 in Puglia. Well I have to be honest. I like OASIS much better. Moreover very close and considering the location, the details, the impeccable professionalism and the sublime food and wine, it is very cheap. The dishes must be tasted. It would be pleonastic to describe them. All apotheotic. The millefeuille with cream and cherries was touching. It was so beautiful and good that I even hated eating it. Look I started eating a certain way 30 years ago from the legendary and unique Don Alfonso. At the time 3 stars. I've been around a lot but a family like Fischetti I've never found. They are of a unique skill, professionalism and humility. That's if I really have to make a combination The only family I would place at this level is the Iaccarino family. I have decided that I will not go anywhere else but only to Oasis. It would not make sense to go so far to eat so, for my taste, disappointing.

The whole meal process feels sumptuous and decadent.  You can buy olive oil tastings and choose bread (if we knew it was coming we’d have done our cheese plate later), you have a couple of amuse bouches and then we did the ala carte prix fixe, sharing dishes.  Local wines and cheeses complemented the experience. The food though often missed the mark.  The smoked okra lacked flavor and swam in one note hummus, the shrimp in tangerine sauce was also one sweet note.  The oxtail seemed to be dry and missing all flavor. Often the dishes felt like there were too many sauces and too rich, while lacking flavor pop.  The entrees were the best, the lamb was flavorful and the chicken with corn pudding was the nights highlight for me.

However, my recent visit last Sunday was a major disappointment.  Our main course was served with little to no explanation, a stark contrast to the meticulous descriptions of past visits. The coordination between serving food and drinks was noticeably lacking, disrupting our dining experience. When I addressed this issue, a visibly uncomfortable and rushed cook was sent to our table, which did not improve our experience but rather detracted from it.  I understand that the restaurant industry has had its fair share of challenges due to the pandemic, but I believe that top-notch customer service and unique dining experiences should remain the cornerstone, especially considering the premium pricing of Od Urla.

2022-09-30,tiphanie d,"We were really disapointed by the tasting menu, it was unwell cooked and the flavours were not balanced. It didn’t worked toegether and we couldn’t finish the most of the plates. At the end of the dinner we had a bad aftertaste in the mouth that we wanted to wash away with bread and olive oil, which to be faire were both really good!

2022-09-10,Nosferatu82,"My first visit in 2020 didn’t go so well but I must say the experience is completely different the last couple of times we went to OD Urla.  I have had the pleasure of hosting business and family guests in several occasions and can say that his is THE place to host the perfect dinner.  Highlights; 1) the booking experience, hassle free and easy 2) OD offers transfer pick ups for regular guests. A must if you plan on having some wine as Urla is notorious for police checkpoints and there is no taxi stops nearby (even though the restaurant is happy to organise a taxi). Being driven around in a Mercedes EV is ofc a treat… great thinking Merca and the OD management.  2) Arrival, top class organising and greeting… 3) Food, authentic with a twist. Even the top restaurants in Istanbul (and Europe) rarely comes close… 4) the service is simply impeccable. In a period where establishments are having a hard time keeping seasoned and experienced staff, OD somehow manages to maintain highly skilled staff with a huge smile on their faces.   In short, a big thank you to the management but to the staff for turning each of my previous 5-6 visits to a tries experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r859461172-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,5,en

The food generally good but not exceptional.  The desert offer was poor. Whats annoyed us was having chosen an award winning red Mozaik wine , we were told that it was full of tanens and the "" somelier"" suggested something else and of course at a high price.  We thought the wine list was good but seriously over priced.  We also decided to buy at the Mozaik wineyard and try the Mozaik wine we wanted to drink. There were no tanens in this 2012 beauty ?!  We can only assume that the somelier was Just pushing high margin wines for greater profit.

It is in a secluded place surrounded by olive trees and mini garden where chef (who is also the owner) grows some of the vegetables there. The ambiant is super nice chic but not extravagant i.e it is a place for people appreciate good good not for people who wants to show off. The food was amazing.

2022-07-01,bonbonturc,"Here are the positives: -Great setting for a restaurant nestled inside an olive grove, service was punctual, the descriptions by the cook staff was to the point and appreciated.  -Loved the OD URLA marked ice cubes in cocktails.   -I asked for a favor and they made me a Bourbon Sour which tasted great.  -I also really like the OD URLA’s own medium bodied red wine. -Tour of the cellar was great, really impressive selection of wines/champagnes from all over the world and the sommelier was both knowledgeable and fun.   Negatives: -There should be either more bathrooms for the ladies or all bathrooms should be marked unisex. -Music can make or break a restaurant and Kenny G. can easily break you at any location :) -We had the tasting menu. There is no reason that there should be 4 forks and 4 knives placed next to my plate. With all the servers they have, forks and knives should arrive with each course.  -Just way too many employees working. At one point I counted 18 cooks at the open kitchen :) most of them idle. -I am not sure what the seating capacity is but it felt crowded, tables very close to each other, at times felt like I was at a cafe :( -About the tasting menu; repetitive, both in terms of presentation and taste. I liked the SAR-MA, the mozzarella appetizer, grilled fish and the lamb shank. I can’t even remember what the dessert was. The red pepper sorbet is not my favorite. I would have loved lavender, rosemary or pine nut instead but that’s just me.  -I was really looking forward to the pasta dish. Even though it tasted OK, pasta was overcooked :(  Will I go back? Yes, probably.  I would limit my food choices and enjoy the wine/cocktail service and the surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r845622861-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,3,en

2024-08-26,ess,"There is a lot to love about this restaurant however a lot of the food doesn’t actually taste very good.   You can see a lot of thought is given to every aspect of the meal but I would argue the appearance of everything takes precedence over the taste of the food.   The non alcoholic pairing was enjoyable with different juices, kombuchas and teas.   Everything is played beautifully, the interior of the restaurant is visually pleasing too. However, taste is a crucial part of a tasting menu and unfortunately this fell VERY short for us.  all of the dishes are very vinegary and they made a big spectacle about using scoby (the mushroom on top of kombucha) as they key ingredient in a few dishes and it is actually pretty foul.  Also,  upon reflection the service felt overbearing at times.   This isn’t about eating tasty enjoyable food, it’s about pushing boundaries and I appreciate that to a certain degree but it’s definitely not for everyone.  There are much more enjoyable food experiences to be had in Copenhagen.

2024-07-23,RorschAch,"The influence of the three-star Michelin restaurant Noma in Denmark even goes beyond the Danish capital. René Redzepi, the founder and head chef of Noma, is considered an influential chef in the world (see the notes in the same category for personal experience) and was selected as the cover character of Time magazine in 2012. His influence on Nordic cooking covers five Nordic countries, such as the newly promoted three-star Michelin restaurant Jordnær and the one-star Michelin restaurant Dill in Iceland. In addition, as a restaurant itself, it has won numerous awards, and the most notable one is that it was ranked first in the list five times in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2021. At the end of 2016, René Redzepi decided to close the restaurant and move it to a new location. He felt that the restaurant was a bit stagnant and the team needed to innovate further, which was a big risk and controversy for the award-winning chef. Fortunately, the new Noma 2.0 has received positive reviews from almost all critics around the world since its opening, including but not limited to The LA Times, The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal.  Scandina-vian cooking methods are derived from their traditions, such as the Vikings' need to use methods such as preservation, drying, smoking, salting, and pickling to ensure that they can survive the long winter, and this tradition continues to this day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r960870751-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en

Mixing up glasses at the table and not even understanding / rectifying it. Food which is complicated for the sake of being complicated. Essence of a dish is lost. The entire meal had only one spice note.  Left the place hungry and got a fantastic hotdog near the trains station .  Knew it would be mediocre but never expected it to be downright terrible.

The 14 courses were too much, 8-10 of them would have been sufficient. Less could have been more.  The drink pairing included some pretty average wines, one of them being quite bad. There was no proper presentation of the wine, e.g. why there were chosen to pair those 2-3 courses, fir which they were offered. It seemed a bit ad hoc. And very expensive for the quality.  The service was very efficient, but still not very personal, except for being offered some pretty average cocktails at the end for not so average prices.  I expected to experience a similar magic as at the Fat duck, but it wasn't even nearly close. Much more expensive though.  I left the restaurant dissapointed and so did my wife.

She was able to answer all of our questions and even took us on a tour of the kitchens after we had finished. We were here for lunch service and had the full tasting menu and wine flight.   It was a truly memorable experience and one that was uniquely its own, completely different to every other 3* Michelin place we have been but could hold its own despite its classic approach and being less theatrical than other places in the same arena.

Courtesy of a dear someone who seems to be a reservation ninja, I was able to eat at a shared table. The place is gorgeous and the setting quaint. Service is friendly and attentive, i.e., 3 star worthy. The food, however, was a huge letdown. The vegetable menu was just not enough to satiate a child. The main was a single mushroom (!). Some of the flavors were plain odd. Mind you, I know my food. Just look at all my other reviews. The wine pairing was exotic. But exotic does not mean good either. Some drops were good, others tasted like cat p*ss. I feel arrogance has creeped into the experience. The chef resting on his laurels has decided to make a mockery of diners it seems. While I do appreciate the art of making amazing food, it also has to be good. And this, unfortunately was a bit of a hit and miss. Go ahead noma, close down sooner than later.

Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression. The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table. But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain. Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures. In the end, the long walk was absolutely worth it and even if the expectations were already very high, they were even topped a bit. Many thanks to the entire team for a memorable evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r974113072-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

The expectations for a 3 Michelin star are wow effect with every dish or as the Guide says “worth the trip”.  Definitely appreciable Cook the Mountain philosophy. There were highs (snails and Alpine grey meat) and some other dishes from which I would have expected more (risotto), a bit anonymous (salad). A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing.

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

2024-04-08,Alessandro P,"Among the 3-star experiences is that of the atelier moessmer was one of the most surprising. I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit. In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved. Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen. The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques. We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet. Even the management, times and portions proved to be simply adequate for the experience. Ultimately it is something that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates haute cuisine and this type of experience.

Is it worth a long journey and an extremely expensive expense to ""eat""? Common sense and practical reason would say no! ! Imagination and curiosity would answer yes! If this were not the case there would be nothing beautiful, artistic, refined or aesthetic! I personally would just like the certainty that this is there and not a tested and pre-packaged mechanism. After this humble and personal general consideration of mine, in detail the house is very welcoming, perhaps the road to reach it is a little dark but it is a completely insignificant detail, the welcome is extremely professional, God forbid, but not taken for granted, the service in the youth room, polite and smiling, young and friendly sommelier. The menu satisfied us in terms of taste and presentation, perhaps I realize that the more you have experiences like this the more you have expectations, often senseless! It is always pleasant to have contact with the chef who in this case tells you the story, the choices and objectives, the projects, certainly following a script for each guest but it seems sincere and authentic.

The welcome is wonderful, in a lounge where you can drink a glass of champagne and taste the first delicacies of a dinner that will prove sublime. It takes us further to the table, for us a comfortable counter overlooking the kitchen, where throughout the evening we will see the painstaking work of a young team, who prepare the dishes with precision and attention as if they were working in an operating theatre. A journey begins that favors local raw materials, including the best butter we have tasted in my life, vegetables from the garden, fish and meat where you can feel the freshness, quality and ability to invent and prepare excellent dishes.

We were therefore gratified to see that Mural was fully booked during our visit, and we very much enjoyed our  meal, the wine pairings, the service, and the atmosphere. Although we normally do not review restaurants, in this case we wanted to offset those negative reviews with our own experience.  Though small and bistro-like, with a casual ambience, the service was impeccable, very much in keeping with Michelin starred restaurants. Each course was thoughtfully prepared using a wide range and combination of ingredients, focusing on fish, vegetables, meat, and finally on a creative and delicious dessert. We found the courses innovative, with servers providing details about each course as it was presented. Similarly, the sommelier matched the food perfectly with German, Austrian, and French wines, providing details about each winery and the grapes used.   We found the prices at Mural similar to other Michelin restaurants, the tasting menu at Mural offering excellent value for the quality provided.

There is a single tasting menu at 155 €.  The dishes are pretty inventive in terms of combination of ingredients and flavours, but the chef manages to convince with what might appear as somewhat contrived combinations to many.

2018-11-19,Patrick37064,"My wife and I recently completed a trip to Munich for Oktoberfest. On the last night of our stay I asked for a 'surprise' restaurant from the concierge and her exact words were, ""You need to go to Mural before they get their first Michelin rating"". So that evening we were off to find Mural.  Be warned that it is a little hard to find off a smaller back street and when you walk in it's not a grand restaurant with lots of money spent on furnishings. It's a small understated restaurant with young chef's doing something you do not expect in Munich. They are making crafted and creative tasting menus comparable to some of the best restaurants in the world.   I have eaten at Maido, Astrid y Gaston, La Mar, Rafael, and Central in Lima, Peru. Borago in Santiago, Chile. All are considered in the top 200 restaurants in the world and I have to say that the little startup 'Mural' rivals them in creativity and potential.  We asked to be surprised with the 8 course tasting menu with wine pairing. We were not disappointed. Like the best restaurants today, the ingredients were locally sourced throughout the Bavarian region. Each course was impeccably presented and the taste was equally satisfying. Woflgang explained each course and explained the wine pairing chosen with each course.   The guys at Mural are very creative and if you like the experience of a tasting menu, as opposed to a couple of BIG course for dinner, I highly recommend Mural. I think the concierge was right about the Michelin rating. Once this place is discovered by a larger audience it will get more and more attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r634508934-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,5,en

Thoughtful ingredient combinations included white asparagu, mini trumpet mushrooms, strawberries marinated in mescal and kohlrabi ash.  Wine pairings were creative and adventurous - I am no sommelier, but was very impressed with the marriage of food and grape.  Always fun to learn about esoteric German and French wines, and the team delighted with surprises including a beetroot digestiv.  The Mosaic team clearly has chemistry and enjoy their craft.  Head chef Luke visited with us three times to provide color as to his creative process and tasting notes.

2023-11-09,AIN_Bln,"The idea to visit Mural came to my colleague and me spontaneously in the afternoon at a trade fair in Munich, when it was clear that we were no longer going to trade fair in the evening, but rather fine dining. Because the recommendation of the GM we consulted online sounded great and because luckily we were apparently able to get the last table for two, we chose Mural. What can I say, we didn't regret it. As Berliners, we were initially surprised when we entered the restaurant: Mural is/was ""actually"" the Muca museum bistro and the interior design is the best shabby chic à la Berlin-Mitte, just like at home! The toilets are a little further away in Wedding or Friedrichshain (on the corner that hasn't yet been gentrified). The staff would also fit in in Berlin, but only at first glance, because behind the relaxed ""Berlin look"" there was not only super friendly and service-oriented staff (neither of which would be the norm in Mitte), but the sommelier in particular was not only knowledgeable, but also took great pleasure in explaining his selection, without lecturing, wonderful! The wine accompaniment was very Jura and natural wine-heavy (there is also a small but fine wine menu with wine by the glass, especially for rarities and GGs, and an extensive bottle wine menu), which doesn't really excite me, but here I have to admit that the combination with the respective course was pretty good. In general, the food: modern, but not forced, delicious, handcrafted and visually convincing. We were delighted across the board, only the cheese sauce for the mountain trout was a bit too hard, the delicious mountain cheese practically flattened the actually even more delicious fish. The rest, especially the pikeperch and the venison, were great. If it wasn't so far away, I would like to come more often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r925285297-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,5,en
2023-08-08,John G,"+a convincing concept, very interesting dishes, very well-crafted, excellent products.  +modern, industrial style, few tables  +lively, but not too loud.  +friendly and motivated waiters and waitresses (but they seemed overwhelmed to me, some of them were running around...) +cooks (not the boss) presented their dishes themselves, but one cook was extremely disinterested, just recited her little verse, an embarrassing moment (also strange that she wasn't wearing chef's trousers, but private (?) jeans). +sommelier: knowledgeable, friendly, funny. Good recommendation, clear price information (verbally) before ordering. A top man!  - no wine list (the sommelier said he was the wine list) - you can do that, but I would have liked to have had an impression of the selection - service was not very organized - who was responsible for us? Changed several times. we also had to point out after the greeting and the first course that we would like to order a wine (otherwise we would have just had an empty glass of sparkling wine and water...), everything got pretty hectic.  - the (sweet) dessert came without warning before the cheese course, even though we had chosen the cheese immediately beforehand (it was then explained that the kitchen could then clean up earlier); order is not a dogma for me, but this could have been announced, which is usually done, but was forgotten in our case (see above); sweet wine was kindly offered, but then we went back to the red wine and the cheese...  Conclusion: There was a lack of a head waiter/chef who had an overview. Amazing for such good cuisine and such a good concept.

2024-11-03,Tryggve Nielsen,"Welcome to Maaemo! Norways first 3-stars Michelin restaurant. A dinner at Norways  top restaurant without kids is something we had been eagerly looking forward to. Food, wine and service is good, but jokingly we told ourselves at the start of the service, what if this is actually being part of The Menu?   After finishing of the meal at the dining hall, we are led back to chill out lounge where we started. Coffee is served, but suddenly the friendly waiter which has treated us nicely throughout the evening, comes to our table and asks us to come for a tour to visit the kitchen. In the middle of serving hot coffee this feels a bit peculiar, and we ask to bring our cups with us. Not a problem at all! He shows us everything that is going on there, fridge, main kitchen, winters menu etc. We walk around, smile and ask questions to show interest in what is shown to us. We are a bit puzzled why this tour is actually given and don't really see the main point, but we chat along and remark to him and others how nice everything is.  Well back at the chill out lounge we are served dessert and more coffee. My wife asks, could I have decaf? Sure, we'll take care of this. But nothing happens. The night is still young, so I would like a drink and ask the waiter to see the drink menu. ""Sorry, we don't have this"". ""Can I order a Macallan 25 yrs, I can see you have a bottle in the bar"". ""Let me check"". The waiter comes back a bit later. ""Sorry, we have stopped serving alcohol now"". The clock is around 22.30. Wow, that was early.. suddenly the same waiter come back and start serving wine to the neighbouring table. So strange, we are denied but others are still served?!? We ask the waiter about this. ""Sorry, but we can't serve you anything more. Based on your behaviour no more for you guys"". ""Sorry, what?"" ""Yes, based on bad things that went on at the kitchen tour, it's no more for you guys"". ""Ehhh, sorry what do you mean we did at the kitchen?"" ""You walked around with coffee cups, and your wife put her cup on the kitchen table"" ""Eh sorry what? We brought the cups back with us, and bringing the coffee with us was ok for you."" ""Sorry can't help you. No more alcohol for you"". ""Are you saying that we are drunk"" ""No."" ""Are you accusing my wife for bad behaviour?"" ""Ehh, sorry I don't know what to tell you"" ""But what is going on??"" ""Sorry, I'm not allowed to say any more"". ""Ok, we're out of here. Give us the bill and our jackets.""   This is by far the worst experience we've ever had at a restaurant, regardless of number of Michelin stars.  A horrible rip-off without comparison, a total lack of respect for the customer, and an arrogant and rude behaviour with no limitation. Thanks Espen Holmboe Bang for a great night at your restaurant!!!! Spending 15K and then total humiliation from your waiters is absolutely worth the price. As we told the waiter while we tore the menu in two and threw it at his feet while we left, we will never visit this craphole ever again. More like Kafkas The Process than The Menu - the staff treat you horribly but no-one is able to tell you why. But please visit Maaemo if this is your cup of tea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r978486097-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,1,en

The service is fine, it's about what you'd expect at that price point, but not beyond. Don't go in expecting fun surprises, but your water glass will remain full and your napkin will (usually) be replaced when you get up and go to the bathroom. The food is so jaw-droppingly unremarkable you'll wonder if someone is playing a trick on you. I just finished dining there, and this was the big occasion dining experience of my honeymoon, and no joke the best things I had tonight were some broth and a nice little bite of brown butter ice cream. That's not acceptable at a such a price point. Do I regret going to Maaemo? Obviously, but at the same time, it was kind of funny and inspiring. It makes me want to work harder and now I'm quite certain that if I spent a few months preparing, I too could make a Michelin quality meal.

2024-08-24,Amstraveler,"The hardest lunch choice is what to drink.  I’m normally a fan of pairing wines and Maaemo does what I really like and offers three different quality packages (at three different price levels).  But buying wine in Norway is a bit overextravagant under any circumstances - the NOK 16000 ‘Holy Grail’ pairing, while it would undoubtedly have been divine, was no exception.  Many guests limited themselves to water but we went for a juice pairing which was an unexpected delight.  Mixtures like cherry juice with a hint of nettle and toasted hazelnut were surprisingly successful (especially when pairing a dish with hazelnut in the sauce) - I’ll have a go at making some of the mixtures myself now.  Food (in the 14 courses) mostly superb, some merely very good.  For me the starters and main courses beat the desserts (three ice cream dishes perhaps one too many) with the signature oyster/mussel and king crab/reindeer combos as highlights. Coffee weak. Unlimited water.  Ambience superb, service formal and a little subdued but extremely attentive, around 10 tables each of 1 or 2 people when we were there.  Amusingly we sat next to one gentleman whose vacations consisted mostly of visiting the world’s best restaurants (and told everyone in earshot about his visits).  He felt the restaurant lacked a star performer on the service team (maitre d’ or whatever) which was to him essential in a top restaurant.  Maaemo indeed works with a flat org structure front of house so for someone to whom a star performer out front is critical to their enjoyment - well go elsewhere or forget your prejudice and just enjoy the dishes.  No background music until the last couple of dishes were served.  Prices as advertised - very high; but that’s Norway for you.  Watch out when reservations open - I tried for supper the day of our visit and the restaurant was fully booked half an hour before reservations were supposed to open. Lunch was still available.  Maybe there’s a secret trick that increases your chance of success ….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r966572767-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en

The non alcoholic pairing was as well a little uninspired and starters (amuse bouche) as well as the sweets towards the end of the dining experience (the parts to be taken on the lower floor) a bit too simple “sweet&fatty” and thus a bit disappointing.

2024-07-31,RorschAch,"Maaemo 2.0, a three-star Michelin restaurant in Oslo, Norway, is the only two three-star Michelin restaurants in Norway (also ranked 47th in the world in 2021). It reopened in 2019 and was awarded three Michelin stars. Its predecessor (which won three Michelin stars in 2016 but closed 9 years after its opening) is located above the train tracks leading to Oslo Central Station and is only 300 meters away from the old site. The name comes from the Old Norwegian translation of ‘Mother Earth’, although its chef Esben Holmboe Bang is actually Danish. But since he has spent most of his culinary career in Oslo, his cooking style is to explore the flavors of local Norwegian ingredients. According to him, 85% of the ingredients come from within 30 miles of Oslo, and the rest of the seafood on the menu, such as wild salmon cooked in salt butter, comes from the pristine waters of the northern coast of Norway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r962593813-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2023-09-17,Michael U,"As the only Michelin 3* Restautant in Norway Maaemo carries a banner, ""Mother Earth"" in Finnish Chef Esben Holmboe Bang serves a menu focused on organic, biodynamic, and raw local ingredients with the end-goal being zero waste but no restrictions in terms of taste or technique.   Found in the Oslobukta neighborhood diners begin and end in the lounge while a high-ceilinged dining room utililzes organic materials and dramatic lighting to draw attention to an open kitchen working in near silence across 15 courses.  Danish by heritage, though Esben’s plates consistently pay homage to Norwegian traditions, it comes as no surprise that Dinner begins with Potato Lompe topped in Cod plus Horseradish before proceeding through bites including Foie Gras, local Cheese and raw Beef topped in Pine Cone Vinegar.  Occasionally giving in to ""New Nordic"" ideals, though Butter and Fat see Maaemo’s flavors trend more rich than its contemporaries, plates in the dining room began with smoked Vendace Roe perfumed by elderflower that paired beautifully to 2020 Benjamin Leroux Chassagne-Montrachet.  Benefited by faultless service, every staff member executing at the highest level of personal yet professional engagement, Scallops arrived next with tart Fruits preceding Bang’s iconic Flat Oyster with Blue Mussels and Dill that has been a mainstay since 2010.  Pulling back in terms of intensity with a subtle plate of Turnips and Nettles, then serving a recently added slice of Char in a complicated Sauce that vacillates from sweet to savory, the night’s “main course” featured half a roasted Quail with Plums and Sunchokes alongside golden Milk Bread and a decorative spread made from Mushrooms with Garlic.

It is discretely located on the corner of a block,  with an unassuming wooden door, where the only clue is a small brass plate above a door buzzer.   Other than that a perfect experience.  We found the difficulty in finding the entrance something to laugh about, not troubling.  Nonetheless, be sure to arrive a bit early, in order to locate the entrance. We appreciated being given a small folder with a  list of all of the courses, once  Once you buzz the door, you enter the vestibule where your coats are taken. Then you proceed to the ""living room"" downstairs, where welcome drinks and the first three to four courses are served.  Beautiful pieces of art to look at!  To describe these starters as an explosion of tastes would not do them true service.  These hors dóuevres are a carefully orchestrated gustatory  symphony of contrasting and complimenting tastes.  Be aware that the champagne costs extra.    After the starters,  you proceed to the dining room on the main floor, where several more courses are served, each one an experience in itself, with balanced combinations of flavours that I would not have imagined.  Each dish was lovely to look at, delightful to tase.  Then it is back to the ""living room"" to wind down with desserts.  The service was excellent, formal and highly attentive, yet still friendly and approachable with any questions.  The staff worked as a well-orchestrated team to ensure that the diners were served their courses with precision, and that any questions were answered. You can watch the cooks make the final preparations with precision.  We were a party of four, where I was the only one to take the wine package, which was very good, but perhaps a bit of a let-down given the price tag.  Nonetheless, I would probably go for the wine pairing again if I did it once more.  Be aware that each glass of wine is for about three courses.  One of the others took two glasses of wine, one white and one red, with the main courses. and were very pleased.  One member of the group  took a non-alcoholic beverage pairing which was remarkably good, an unconventional combination of ingredients that resulted in an impressive drink.

Normally, we enjoy the starters, but it’s downhill from there because the main dishes are too large (and boring) when one would prefer to have more, and smaller, dishes to be able to taste more things. Not so here. Everything was perfect. And the dishes included all our favourite foods! We particularly enjoyed the innovative and creative takes on traditional  foodstuffs like the outstanding dish with reindeer hearts as well as the dishes with caviar from different sources. And pinnekjøtt more interesting than any I have had before. And lomper, shrimp, scallops, king crab, mushrooms and strawberries as well as  duck leg, beef, turbot, peas, quail and brioche and rhubarb. Even now, I am unable to say what I liked best. Interesting matching wines, too. And did I mention the outstanding staff? I was smiling all evening. Pure bliss.  Oops, I almost forgot. A good review needs something negative. Mhh, well … I couldn’t eat my second cinnamon bun. In retrospect, I would have loved to take it home. They were quite tasty, after all  Sorry, but this is all the negative I can come up with.

The elegance of the whole restaurant that embraces you from the moment you step inside the doors is one of a kind.  The service is impeccable. The atmosphere delightful. From the fireplace, the furniture, the smell, the pleasant silence even though people were speaking.  And then the food!!

2022-08-08,Mary Ella Feinleib,"I was thrilled to get a reservation at Maaemo, the northernmost Michelin three-star restaurant in the world. I'm sorry to have to say I was disappointed. I expect any three-star restaurant to have pretensions about its food, but I found Maaemo beyond pretentious. The servers were nice enough but so formal that the effect was chilling. First we we were taken to a dimly lit basement room for our starters. I could barely see what I was eating!  As each of the five  one-bite starters were presented, the waiter recited the ingredients--each of the five seemed to have five ingredients!  Precisely one hour later (everything here is timed to the  minute), I and the other diners were escorted up  to the dining room. The decor was stark but attractive and there was was more light here. My waitress stood  at my table and recited the ingredients of each of the eight main courses. Again, she was nice, but stiff. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, ""So, what's the next course going to be?"" ""Oh, I can't tell you that ahead of time."" (To be fair, she gave me a hint.)  The food itself was generally good, but only a few dishes stood out as excellent--disappointing for a three-star restaurant. And  I'm all for innovative food pairings, but the ""shoulder of crab with reindeer heart"" took this concept a bit over the top. I must say that every course was artistically plated. An hour and a half later, to the second, it was downstairs again, for dessert. I enjoyed most of the desserts more than I had enjoyed the starters.   Half an hour later came the check, which was exorbitant, but not inappropriately so. This was not my favorite restaurant meal, but it was my most interesting restaurant experience.  Maaemo, please lighten up a bit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r852898542-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,3,en

And I must say that I'll do it again, and again, and again... :-) The place is gorgeous, in the castle of Bourlingster. Really impressive. We were then warmly welcomed by the team and started with the menu. It was an amazing vegetal journey... Wine pairing was very good too...

I am  a regular customer of the Brasserie (which is great and has in my view the best price to quality ratio in Luxembourg), and the second visit to the restaurant. My wife and I opted for the vegetarian menu. There are not many words to describe the food other than to say that it is a true revelation; compared to the earlier visit, I think it still has gone op a notch. The research that the Chef is putting into the local flora, the range of (local) herbs that he uses in his food, the complexity of flavors that he creates with vegetables and herbs only, and the extraordinary combinations are a testimony to the chef's talent and passion. My son had a smaller version of the menu (which does however feature the same dishes) - and I liked the fact that all of the amuse-bouche came for the 3 of us.  We really enjoyed this fantastic meal. I have been to many Michelin restaurants, most of them are great - with the focus on herbs and vegetables at this level, the Distillerie is however special - and in my view, one of the best vegetable based restaurants in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r757532703-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html,5,en

All you can hear is other customers talking. its a chateau, they should have had a fireplace, or atleast curtains at the very least. all wuld have been forgiven but the meal was just bad, the central theme was smoke, the smokiness in some of the courses was actually the only good taste, we tried the veg and the non-veg course,  understandably the vegetables were seasonal and one would expect them to be tasty or interesting. It was neither, from a potato dish that had a lot of  raw potato pieces, to oven baked cabbage leaves, celery bits on cabbage, nothing tasted good. The dessset was the biggest let down, i left most of my dishes on the plate and the hostess would only smile and say hope it was ok, well I left most of it so .... I really wanted to like it but it was below par, the wine was good not standout, but at 400 euros for two people, i would take my money elsewhere.

Make sure you can stand several glasses of wine if you opt for the wine selection :). The cuisine has clearly a French base, but revisited with a lot of creativity in the use of ingredients and a presentation of courses which itself is worth the price. We took the ""small"" signature menu and I can say that you really don't leave hungry.

2024-08-24,Michael H,"I do not recommend this obviously well regarded restaurant for solo travelers.  The pacing is exceedingly slow with (sometimes very) small dishes served 15-20 minutes apart, leaving a lot of time between dishes . I note that at least one other duo kept looking around the corner anxiously looking for their next bites. It is a lovely interior with an open kitchen; several other diners stopped by the kitchen to rhapsodize about their experience and the food, but not me.  I generally found the complex dishes ok but nothing exciting.  It’s not cheap- the meat and fish menu was 1430 kroner and the drink pairing (7 rather small servings) was another 1050. There is no pre-set pairing for the snacks, so the recommended champagne match was 280 kroner. The champagne was my preferred beverage of those served. One wine - the Momento Mori from Australia- was tasted but not consumed. Maybe just not for me as my serving was the last drops from the bottle, so not a bottle issue. Only one other pairing- a Barbera with the veal - was anything I’d order again.  The pairings included a beer and a cider. As I informed the wait staff I did not want any cocktails, a wine was substituted for the final pairing (with dessert) of a lingonberry cocktail. (When I first told the waiter that I did not drink cocktails I got a push back saying it was part of the restaurant’s philosophy). This wine was served before being brought to the table, perhaps a first in my experience at any Michelin rated restaurant. After 3 ¼ hours, shorter than others who say 4 hours, I was still hungry. Neither the food nor beverage portions were very robust. Each dish was presented with a detailed explanation, largely showcasing the restaurant’s commendable commitment to sustainability. I hesitate to rate the restaurant only 3 stars, but even if every dish was outstandingly tasty, the cost, pace and quantity of food would have left me dissatisfied.

There are two different options of a set - Meat&fish and Vegetarian. We’ve chosen Meat&fish one. The set is good, but not striking. Some dishes are interesting, but majority are average. Course (10 servings) costs 1430 NOK, they also offer a wine paring (7 courses) for 950 NOK or 630 NOK if you prefer non-alcoholic drinks. There are good cocktails (4 in the menu), they are recommended for snack servings, but cocktails also good suit for other dishes:) there is also a wine card, but this time there we no orange wine by glass. The restaurant’s sommelier advised us very interesting floral Riesling and it was definitely very good choice.  But the dinner is longer than it should be - pauses between starters are 15-20min, between main dishes are 30min, so be ready to spend 4 hours for 10-course set.

The resourcefulness they demonstrate is really cool, “last night’s” rye bread with onion scraps was one of my wife’s favourite dishes and using pear cores from last season to flavour cocktails is very imaginative.  The “potato and whey” was the most underwhelming sounding course yet tasted fantastic, as did most of the food - the odd bit wasn’t to my taste but I’m not a fish fan so expected that before I arrived!

The 7 coarse meal was absolutely divine. The plates were beautiful and the food was amazing and the pairings all worked perfectly. Our favorite dishes (although its hard to choose) were the tartar and the goat. There were 2 dessert dishes, one of which was so good it brought tears to my eyes.. not an exaggeration.. it was so. good.

2021-05-25,LeesaSikveland,"Prior to actually attending dinner, we had deferred our reservation on many occasions due to Corona restrictions, however during the time the communication with the restaurant was precise and informative, checking allergies/dietary requirements etc.  Upon arrival, we were politely greeted by one of the owners, who gently notified us of the required safety measures they have in place.  The restaurant is very calming and minimal, whilst being elegant and offering a well put together  (discrete) playlist (another passion of the owner).  The offering is either a vegetarian or a meat/fish 7-course tasting menu (I being very fussy, opted for a mixture of vegetarian and fish) of which they were more than happy to accommodate.  Together with a drinks package and an extensive wine list.  Our guests opted for the drinks package, which was exciting to see emerge and learn how they suit the food; whilst we went for a beautiful, well priced, organic bottle (or 2) of Syrah.  I could go on for some time, talking about how fabulous the food was, which left us saying lots of ""ohhhs"" and ""arrghs"", however, I would hate the ruin the surprise.  Though bear in mind the food was truly spectacular, made with so much love and passion and changes regularly.  All the staff were attentive and knowledgeable about both food and drink and obviously take a great deal of pride in their passion for food (plus they all remembered my allergy).  This fabulous restaurant gets booked up, so it's advisable to book a good few weeks ahead and whilst is not the cheapest restaurant in this up and coming area, it is by far one of the best meals I have ever had in Stavanger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r789866709-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html,5,en

The dishes were works of art in themselves and it is so impressive how they manage to use up all the ingredients. Not even the fish skin is thrown away, it turns into tasty chips. Cider from the family at Randaberg was also served, we had lots of exciting wines to go with each and every course. After we finished, we were given a tour of the kitchen.

2024-06-02,Peherka,"Ola Klepp's cuisine is full of tastes, many of which are new to a French palate: bitterness, acidity, complex pairings, in short a happy mixture of flavors. The pairing of non-alcoholic drinks, very successful overall, reinforced this journey with unusual taste impressions (elderberry, verbena, spruce, lime, strawberries, kombucha, etc.). However, the start of the meal did not start off in the best way: the dried fish skin with turnip was a successful start aesthetically but not of exciting taste; just as the ceviche which followed proved to be of little interest.  We were then very disappointed, when the following dishes took us into another universe that was infinitely more interesting and tasty. This was first the case for the mackerel, with monkfish liver cream and buckwheat cream, accompanied by bread with a strong personality and a small salad; the beef tartare with black pudding and grilled green pepper proved to be a great dish; the next, the catch of the day, was accompanied by a sublime seafood sauce, with a lightness at the same time as an anthological depth of taste; everything else was of the same level, with special mention for the combination of celeriac and mushrooms, another very great dish, as well as the lamb cooked twice with miso sauce: great art! The strawberry and rhubarb dessert was an apotheosis of taste and freshness; exceptional sweet treats of lightness and originality - including an astonishing cannelé of a quality never before achieved in the French restaurants where I was able to taste them - came to end this meal. One of the originalities of this restaurant is that it is the cooks who, in turn, come to bring you and describe - extensively - the dishes. The restaurant is small, the kitchen is open and we were in immediate contact with the kitchen, a real spectacle but with the disadvantage of leaving with clothes soaked in the smell of charcoal… All this is not cheap (around €450 for two, with drinks), but we came away, after 2h45, with stronger impressions than during our dinner at Maaemo, in Oslo (a three-star restaurant) , two years ago, when everything was perfect, but the flavors less marked (and the addition even much saltier). At K2, with the exception of the first two dishes, which were quite unconvincing, everything else was of a level well above a Michelin star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r953435879-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html,5,en

2024-05-05,Sommerfuglen,"We had been looking forward to visiting K2 for a long time. We were welcomed and given a nice table in beautiful surroundings. This was shellfish lunch. Felt a bit chaotic as we got a lot of food on the table at the same time. Good oysters and scallops. Both a sight for the eyes. The power in the scallop tasted heavenly. We got mussels and boat potatoes, the mussels tasted lovely, but they could have dropped the potatoes for me. Ceviche of long was good, and very nicely presented. We ate salmon stir-fry, which is always good. Got fresh prawns which were a bit tame in colour. Prawns taste best in the winter months. The last dish was pepper crab, good! A marsupial crab was used. It was slightly broken, so difficult to eat with a knife and fork as utensils. Norwegian strawberries with herbs for dessert, delicious! The food was presented and we were recommended lovely drinks to go with the food. A little lacking in service in relation to the level, such as checking in on the table to hear if the food tasted good or if we needed anything. Reacted to the fact that no one said thank you for the visit, or hade and welcome back when we left. Good, but below expectations in relation to the fact that this is a Michelin restaurant, both in terms of food and service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r949587795-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html,4,en

2022-09-10,Travelcritic30,Firstly we have to praise the fabulous restaurant which provided exquisite food with a small but varied menu.  It was fairly pricey - 3 courses E47 per head - but well worth it.  The staff were charming and extremely courteous.  Unfortunately we cannot be as generous about our room.  This was situated in the Pavilion and was dated and clumsy in appearance.  The bathroom had mould around the shower area which needs addressing.  There were no toiletries (only a used shampoo and sewing kit!) or bottles of complementary water which tends to be standard in many hotels if this calibre.    The Spa!  This was super and we made use of it twice being able to book it out privately for E15 per head.

It was my husbands Birthday and I let them know ahead of time, but still no options.  I did ask for a cake and well, we got a lemon with a candle in it.  So, no, I would not recommend this place.  Especially if you are vegetarian or VEGAN!  Ack!  Which I am not, but I still would have liked to have something other than Foie Gras.   Place is very quiet- I would suggest some light background music.

Erosed plastic terrace furniture... The dining room spreads a touch grandeur, but once again, '80's-'90's, dated colors, carpets ...and this strange mix of beamed ceiling and plastered chimneys that shouldn't be mixed. In this case, the beams should be hidden behind decent plasterwork to fit with the rest of the athmosphere. Food was not up to what we expected. The egg in the starter was raw. The lobster sauce with the fish was not tasteful, too salty and too prominently present. However desert was magic! Succulent. This seems to be, without any doubt their strength. Drinks were very highly priced (10€ for a standard glass of white wine?) We feel what's offered is not up to the price you pay, the dinner as such being totally overrated.

Room was lovely if not a little tired however that's sometimes 'the look' in these places. Fine. Went to the restaurant and had really great service. Food however left a little to be desired. We went for three courses. My fish dish consisted of scallops - when they arrived they were underdone. I know there's a fine line with scallops but they were cold in areas and translucent. There was some kind of mush in the middle which didn't add anything to the dish at all. The lamb was a bit tough. Would have expected better from a French restaurant.

While some of the dishes on the Gastronaut menu were delicious, it would have benefitted from dropping at least two of the courses, which would have made the meal more enjoyable. Sadly, the Gastronaut's menu was extremely disappointing with 3 of the dishes too salty, so much so that one of them was inedible. Since we were driving home afterwards, we tried the non-alcoholic wine but all three proved undrinkable. Overall, not the evening we had hoped for and definitely not worth the money.

Tip 2: Arrive around 30 minutes before your reservation time to experience the bar and explore the restaurant a bit. Interesting fun fact: I wasn't able to make out what the kitchen staff on the other side of the kitchen were shouting periodically. (The kitchen is big!) I was curious and followed up with an online inquiry the next day (having forgotten to ask our wonderful waiter), and received a prompt response: ""the kitchen sounds out 'here we are' to acknowledge that a guest is arriving or departing the kitchen.""

2024-09-02,jim t,"I initially hesitated to write this review, but I realized that every restaurant, regardless of its reputation, deserves honest feedback. My wife and I dined here for our anniversary, hoping for a memorable experience. Unfortunately, while the food was good, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. My wife’s entrée, a prosciutto-wrapped tenderloin, arrived lukewarm at best, which was disappointing.  However, the main reason for this review is the unsettling feeling we left with. The waitstaff’s demeanor made us feel as though we were a burden or had unknowingly offended them. We spent part of the evening and even the next day questioning if we had done something wrong. The only explanation we could think of was that we were among the last seatings of the night, and perhaps the staff had already mentally checked out.  When I spend nearly $1300 on a dinner, I shouldn't be left wondering if it was my fault that the service was subpar. In contrast, the previous night we dined at Three Blacksmiths and left with a sense of joy, eager to recommend it to friends and family. It was less than half the price, yet the service was far superior, and the food quality was on par. I’ve had better service at places like DC Prime or Morton’s.  Maybe I don’t fully understand what a 3-star Michelin rating signifies, but based on this experience, it didn’t seem to offer anything extraordinary. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant, as it did not feel worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r968047689-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,3,en

2024-07-01,WPLandry,"We've been wanting to experience dinner here for a while now and could not be more happy with our entire experience. Everything was absolutely perfect from start to finish. Arriving at the Inn, you are greeted with respect as you are whisked from your car into the Inn. Our server was excellent and had quite the sense of humor! He provided detailed explanations of the dishes as well as tidbits about the restaurant, chef, etc. We felt the wine pairing was true perfection. Each dish complimented each glass and vice versa. With every bite, we were transported to a place of pure enjoyment. Not only that, but each dish was a work of art in the craftsmanship it took to create the display. After dinner, we relaxed for some time in the lounge and were treated to a tour of the kitchen where we had the honor of meeting Chef O'Connell. After dinner, our car was outside with the AC on and engine running, just waiting for us to settle in. Every moment was perfect and we could not have asked for anything more. This is truly deserving of 3 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r957585891-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,5,en

2024-05-27,rkny18,"Having eaten at other 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants, I’m not quite sure how the Inn has 3.  The food is good, but there were not multiple life changing dishes that we wanted to eat more of.  Maybe 1 or 2. Compared to Le Bernadin or L’Enclume, where we noted we’d come back for a big plate of nearly everything we ate, the Inn’s executions were enjoyable, but not particularly unique or memorable, with the exception of the lobster chartreuse.  The cheese course was excellent, but felt a bit rushed in its presentation, and was somewhat delayed in arrival. The cheese  server’s funny asides and puns were cute and clever, but they took away from time that could have been better spent seriously describing the cheeses. I suppose the jovial presentation is geared toward people who perhaps don’t really care to hear much about the varieties.  One cheese course detail I took great exception to was being served Carr’s Table Crackers with the cheese (along with some nice bread we’d already had during the meal). I mean, really? Carr’s? The same crackers I can buy at any grocery store? Served at a 3 star Michelin restaurant?  Embarrassing at best. Insulting at worst.  The bar experience both before and after dinner was a little odd.  We initially went to Patty O’s bar for a glass of pre-dinner champagne. While we were warmly greeted there, that was the beginning and end of the attention. The sole bartender didn’t look at or address us in any way. Meanwhile a gaggle of staff chatted away at the host’s station. After a few minutes of this inattention, we left for the Monkey Bar at the Inn across the street.  The Monkey Bar isn’t a proper bar with stools or chairs. It’s table service only, so any opportunity to chat with a bartender or a neighbor is mostly gone.  We were shown the ”bar”, but given no guidance as to where to sit. Oddly, we were asked if we were joining them for tea. They already knew we were there for dinner. Do a lot of dinner guests arrive early for tea? This spoke to a lack of communication.  We plopped down in 2 chairs l hoped weren’t reserved, and waited several minutes for any kind of recognition. Finally, someone came by to wipe down our table, which in my mind should have been done immediately after the previous guest left, not as we sat there watching.  A server came by to take a water order and chatted with us briefly about the whisky offerings. But after he left, he was replaced by s different server and we never interacted with him again.  This proved to be somewhat thematic throughout dinner. We were told we had one main server, and we did see her a few times, but it felt like each course was served by someone different, with varying levels of knowledge, polish, and enthusiasm.  One server kicked our table. Another bumped abruptly into my wife’s arm with no apology. So much for those ballet lessons Patrick paid for for the staff!  We asked for sparkling water. A random server brought it. I didn’t recognize the label so I enthusiastically asked “Oh, what’s that?”, pointing to the label. “Sparkling water” replied the server. lol come on. She eventually grasped that I was asking where it was from.  After the meal, we sensed they wanted the table back, so we decided to get after dinner drinks back at the bar.  Again, no actual bar, just some cushy chairs. It was comfortable, but my wife was a bit chilly from the AC blowing on her legs.  I asked our bar server if they had a throw she could use. He replied “Of course”, which has maddeningly become the de facto reply from the younger generation of servers today, to every request, regardless of the sincerity of the responder or the response.  No throw ever materialized. My wife remained chilly.  More chilly than the air however, were the drink prices.  $200 for a 1 ounce pour of an unusual but certainly not rare Islay Scotch, an entire bottle of which can be purchased for $250. $51 for a 1 ounce pour of basic Laphroaig 10 year. A bottle of that is $60 most places. Champagne by the glass prices were similarly silly.   I guess the alcohol prices were designed to keep people from lingering after the meal, and to make the $170 wine pairing seem like a bargain.   The wine pairing was fantastic I should add. And our sommelier, Nicole, was easily the most attentive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic server we encountered the entire evening. The perfect mix of personable and professional.  Had more of the staff been as great at what they do as Nicole is, I could see 3 Michelin stars. As it is, much of the staff seemed like college kids on summer break.  There is much talk of Mr. O’Connell expanding the Inn. Until he can shore up the service (and push the food envelope a bit) as it stands, I think he risks losing a star or two by becoming even larger. It’s clearly already a challenge for Mr. O’Connell to find experienced knowledgeable staff in the middle of the Virginia countryside. I don’t see how expanding his operation begets better service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r952664580-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,4,en
2024-05-19,mattva1,"What was supposed to be a fantastic evening, turned into a nightmare.   It started a few hours before our dinner when they called and asked me if I would move our reservation up an hour because they had some last-minute cancellations. I figured maybe they had some VIPs or something and wanted my slot. I didn’t really care so I agreed, but clearly explained that I wanted to have a drink before dinner in their bar area. She understood and agreed, saying that a lot of guests do that.  So I thought all was good. It wasn't.  I show up on time and am greeted with “your table is ready.” I asked to have ten minutes for a drink at the bar, but the receptionist wasn't having it. after explaining that we had discussed it when they asked to move my reservation up, she agreed but gave me a disgusted and snarky “fine, let us know when you are ready” sendoff.    So, I am left in a horrible confrontation situation which I didn’t ask for. But, now it is awkward, people think I’m being difficult, they are mad, etc. In any other situation I would have asked my wife if it was ok to leave and find another spot  – but they make you pre-pay a small fortune, it’s our anniversary, there is nowhere else to go in the town, and we drove hours to get there – so I was stuck, there was nothing I could do.   I’m so disappointed because all I wanted was a few minutes to enjoy a high-end, caringly made Manhattan before dinner. I'm sure it sounds small, but I was truly looking forward to it because I only drink on special occasions due to a health scare. Unfortunately for me, that moment was ruined. There was no way I could enjoy myself so I gave up, and couldn't get out of the bar to our table fast enough. But the whole negative vibe carried over into dinner – where I felt rushed and unsettled. My wife knew I was upset and did her best. But, the entire dinner, meal, experience sucked. I hated every minute of it.   I’m sure everyone else will rave about the place. And I get it, having been there half-dozen times for dinners, fundraisers, special occasions - so I do appreciate it. But, that is gone.   No way should this have happened – especially at a place where it costs $1,200 for dinner for two.   As far as the food went, it could have been the best meal in the world and it wouldn’t have mattered to me under the circumstances. But, it wasn’t even particularly good. They killed the shrimp and duck with dill. Except for some egg thing (which was great) the rest was just ok.   While I’m at it, one thing that surprised me was that the mens room was a bit gross. I expect that at an airport or some public place. But, not at a restaurant like this. In all fairness, it’s not entirely their fault if someone can’t hit the urinal, and I noticed someone was heading that way to clean things up. But, it’s a bad look for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r951439652-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,1,en

2024-02-09,UE_DC64,"We stayed one night at the Inn and enjoyed the afternoon tea, the dinner, and the breakfast. What stood out to me was how pampered I felt. There were more staff taking care of us than there were customers. The lodging was super cute and had everything one could wish for, and with small, nice gifts in several rounds. Of course, it wasn't cheap.   The dinner was exquisite but with a few things that could have been better. I loved everything I ate, and the dishes were nicely (and sometimes innovatively) presented. But, while the menu left my wife full, I finished the meal feeling I had room for more. And I am not super huge or anything. We seem to have been unlucky with the bread service. We didn't get any bread (other tables did) and when I asked if we could also get some bread, the response was ""Yes, I can get you some bread"", as if I were asking for a side order, rather than a response like ""Oh, sorry, we missed you, we will get you bread right away"". And I had to do it again for a second piece of bread. This is  very unusual for any good restaurant. Perhaps I was unlucky.  I was also a little disappointed with the breakfast. We got a very nice parfait of sort and then a basket with different types of mostly sweet stuff. Anything else, like an omelet or such would cost an extra $25--rather outrageous in my view. I had expected a nice buffet with lots of different types of bread, cheeses, yogurts, etc., as I would get in any hight star hotel.  All in all, we had a great stay here and enjoyed the pampering and the excellent food, but I few things did not live up to my expectations (for the price we paid)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r937588024-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,4,en

2023-09-23,sarah w,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  If you are complaining about the cost, then this is not a culinary experience for you.  If you are complaining about the portions, then I do not know what to say, but I was more than full and I did not consume everything they offered to me.   My boyfriend and I booked the kitchen table for a birthday celebration.   We were immediately greeted and ushered to the living room of the Inn where we enjoyed some cocktails before dinner.  Then we were greeted by one of the hosts and ushered into the kitchen itself for dinner after being told that we had our table for the entire evening and should not feel rushed, but encourage to tarry and enjoy.    When we entered the kitchen there was an enjoyable exhibition of pomp and circumstance as we were personally greeted by Chef Patrick O'Connell by name and his brilliant smile.  Our table was spacious and the seating comfortable.  Immediately the attentive staff began to serve and accommodate us.  Everyone was gracious and enjoyable.  We had water immediately and personalized menus in hand as we were guided through the selections and choices before us.  With those made, we began an incredible experience for any passionate foodie.    Everything from the house made bread and butter to the parmesan truffle popcorn was not only delicious, but available for unlimited refills.  Restraint was necessary to avoid being overly full long before the end of the meal.  We chose to get everything on the gastronaut's menu between the two of us, including the $62.00 upcharge for the caviar dish.  We had ten courses, including a hand delivered first dessert course by Patrick in honor of the birthday.  Every course and thus every dish was exceptional in taste and presentation.  They then sent us home with a bespoke box of confections.  We got more than I expected.    We also chose to do the wine pairing, and with that additional charge, I can say that one should expect to spend several thousand dollars for an all in dining experience in the chef's kitchen.  What you pay for is an experience and an encounter with not just the 3 Star Michelin Chef himself, but his staff and to witness first hand the amazing fluidity of the kitchen staff.  While I have never eaten in the dining room, I can say that I would without hesitation come back and dine there.  This was a once in a lifetime experience to mark a special occasion for us, so the expense was well worth it to us,  but if you are concerned about the fiscal bottom line or portion size, then this might now be the culinary experience for you.  For us, it was one to remember forever.  ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r918000859-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,5,en

The only issue we had was that during our arrival the person at the front desk ask for prove of the reservation. I did not have cell signal and could not show her. She made me and my wife very uncomfortable. I would expect that an hotel that is so highly regarded would have better service at their reception. After I gave her my Id and told her to check she found my reservation. She should have asked for an ID before she asked for proof of reservation.

2023-08-13,Raksmie H,"I’m giving this restaurant a 2-stars — I’ve dined at over 15 Michelin star restaurants all over the world and 3 of the 15 were 3-stars so I’d like to think that I’m pretty experienced.  I really wanted to walk into this experience loving it but it was average, over priced, and underwhelming (just like I stated in my title).   Staff: Very friendly and super nice, they greeted us at the door and walked us to our table (as expected).  The service at the table was a miss for me, they left crumbs on our table from the bread and it was never cleaned up, usually you’ll have people who come around and clean your crumbs. There wasn’t a stool or a basket where you can put your purse or belongings in, usually they have that at the the table. The sommelier wasn’t certified but he was the sweetest kid! I could tell he was still in training due to his lack of knowledge of pairing the wine with the food, and I also learned that he tried deconstructed dishes that are usually left overs to help him pair the wine which I find very interesting because if you want consistency  throughout the experience, every sommelier should be treated the same. I understand that he’s in training but why wouldn’t you have a certified sommelier around to assist him. The condensation from the wine dripped over my fiancé bread as it was being poured, I’m used a clean bottle. Overall the staff was nice and knowledgeable.   Food: The food was so good but it wasn’t great. We picked the Gastronomy menu with the wine pairing. I found it odd that with the menu you still had to pick this or that, I’m used to enjoying everything on the menu as is but if we still need to pick between appetizers, main course, and dessert let’s not call it a tasting menu. The food was cooked and well prepared but the plating was boring and subpar, there was no theme to the menu it was just food on a white plate.  None of the dishes wowed me it was just good. The wine paired well with the food but we didn’t get the background of what notes to taste for or look forward to, I didn’t enjoy the 4 empty glasses placed on the table for future wine to come, it over crowded our table and it made it a little complicating for our server to serve us food as things had to be moved around — not the type of service you would expect from a 3-star.   Parking: Plenty of parking and valet available. Ambiance: Beautiful seating area and nice colonial feel.  Vegetarian and’s vegan options available.  Overall Summary: In short, you don’t get what you pay for. I suggest you save up the $2K you’re about to spend on this experience and purchase a plane ticket overseas and pay for a 3-star in Spain or France.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910037648-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,2,en
2023-08-13,Kendall K,"This restaurant is good but overhyped. I think Michelin gives this one a “pass” due to the uniqueness of its location, the history and frankly it needs to be re-rated because it does not meet the standard of a Michelin 3 star like Aponiente in Spain. I had high expectations due to how everyone in the town speaks so highly of this place. It honestly feels a little weird because it’s as if everyone is afraid to speak truthfully on the restaurant out of fear they’ll disappear like in a horror movie, kind of cultish vibes. If this is your first Michelin I get why you’d love this place but they have some work to do.   Anyway, out of all of the Michelin restaurants I’ve been to, the service, the presentation and the food all was top notch and was like a dance. The Inn at Little Washington seemed like they were resting on the fact that they were a top rated restaurant and didn’t need to work as hard. For a restaurant that I spent nearly $1,600 for I expected a lot.   I didn’t like that I had to pick between menus. Since I paid for a tasting menu with a wine pairing I expected the restaurant to provide several courses that would fill me up and I was not anywhere near full at the conclusion of dinner. The plating and presentation of the food was boring, there was no style or awe factor in how the food was presented. Most places will try to match the cuisine to a creative plate. It was pretty underwhelming. The Michelin company rated The Inn to have a gastronomy star yet the restaurant didn’t explain what specifically about their menu was gastronomy like others that I’ve been too.   The sommelier we had wasn’t certified and didn’t have his grape pin. Typically Michelin restaurants who have a sommelier in training will have an actual sommelier with them throughout the dining experience. With our wine pairing they placed several empty glasses on the table which I had never seen before and didn’t fill them, typically your wine glasses aren’t just sitting on the table taking up space from your plates. Generally each glass is brought to you for each course. They didn’t take the time to wipe off the bottles after they pulled it from the wine cooler, as the sommelier in training poured, there was lots of ice water from the bottle dripping on our table and food.   The waiters didn’t remove bread crumbs from our table, didn’t fold our napkins when we went to the restroom, didn’t have a stool or basket for us to put our belongings in at our table. Nothing during the fine dining screamed three star restaurant, I think Michelin needs to re-evaluate this, I believe this place is a ONE star at best. Overseas Michelin’s seem to have to go through a higher grading criteria because I’ve seen way better places that are underrated that could be two or three stars and the Inn is somehow rated higher with not nearly as good of service.   Typically if the chef is not on travel they will come out and greet their guest and Mr. O’Connell didn’t seem to have the time I presume to stop by tables to simply say hello. I truly expected more but you know what they say about high expectations leading to high disappointment. It’s just not worth the money spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910031634-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,3,en
2023-08-13,SVWOnline,"Not our first visit, but certainly our least enjoyable.  Our only expectation was that the experience would justify the $2800 we paid for a party of 4. I feel strongly that objectively it missed the mark. I will repeat what others reviewers have already stated. My very first cocktail was incorrect. The food service timing was oddly off. A table close to us was seated after we were and was on their 3rd course before our appetizers arrived. The bread service was inconsistent and as many have pointed out the breadcrumbs on our table were only removed prior to our desert. Quarters were cramped, forcing servers to reach over the table. Multiple times during the meal objects were dropped close by startling all of us. Overall the service was good but not delivered with ease and the engagements felt rehearsed. The star of the evening was our sommelier. Her knowledge and explanations of our wine pairings were both insightful and entertaining. At the end of our meal we were not offered after dinner drinks or coffee/tea service. We end up retiring to the bar area for drinks, where the disappointment continued and we waited 15 minutes for someone to recognize we were done so we could pay our check. I ended up paying cash for the drinks so we could leave without any further hurdles.

We recommend the trip to Radovljica and join the visit to Linhart hause with the workshop at  Radol’ca Chocolate (few steps away) or with one of museums or just walk through beautiful old town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274879-d23569931-r936801735-Hisa_Linhart_Restavracija_Hotel-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,5,en

2023-09-19,Judy B,This restaurant uses fresh local ingredients. We  had a 3 course dinner with their wine. It was amazing. We went with a group and everyone was raving how wonderful it was. The chocolate dessert with strawberries had hot fudge poured over it that melted the hollow ball of chocolate. The flavor was addicting! Service  was excellent and they explained each course. They are proud of their restaurant and should be. I am hard to impress when it comes to food and this was great.It is located in a renovated but preserved home built in the 1400s in a small attractive village near Lake Bled.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274879-d23569931-r917413488-Hisa_Linhart_Restavracija_Hotel-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,5,en

2023-08-13,Vierdank,"The little town Radovljica is near to the tourist village Bled and has a beautiful fairy tale old town part. On the main street - in a likewise charming and beautifully renovated house - you'll find Hisa Linhardt. It is primarily a gorgeous restaurant with an ""attached"" hotel.  The old and renovated - simple yet elegant - house (and yes, hisa means house) have some hotel room individually decorated and of different sizes. After the dinner it is rather nice to take ten steps to your bed, so consider an overnight stay.  Ten steps... indeed. There are a number of rooms for dining spread out all over the house. So, for instance, our party of four were seated on the landing of the first floor. Even after quite a dose of champagne it will be hard not to find the way home...  Ambition in the kitchen is high and so is the skill. Clever flavour compositions with both traditional cooking and surprises charactherizes the menu. Wich can be had as 5, 7 or 9 courses. For what Hisa Linhardt can deliver, the prizes are moderate and affordable for an experience of this kind. Present prizes (August -23) are 89, 109 and 129 EUR respectively.  We had the 5 course and with one amuse bouche coming in after another we ended up with around 10 servings.  We took the wine pairing to see what the sommelier felt was right to the different courses. He was mostly spot on - with some few drawbacks. On the other hand much is of course about personal taste.  Amongst all that was being served we felt that the vegetable dishes really shined. Also when shellfish was presented, we admired the knowledge in the kitchen how to treat really fine ingredients without drowning them in other flavours.  On the whole a wonderful evening and the Michelin star is definitely well deserved!  Highly recommended!

2023-05-14,cktraveller40,"What an experience! I organised a birthday dinner for 10 people plus a small child and everything, from the planning stage to the actual dining experience can only be defined as exquisite! The restaurant is in a beautifully restored building; we were given a private dining room for our party. The service staff was both highly professional and kind and catered perfectly to various dietary needs.   The dishes were all, without exception, delicious and beautifully presented. The vegan menu is as carefully and lovingly crafted as the ""regular"" menu, and I highly recommend it. All ingredients are locally and sustainably sourced. We chose local wines and were not disappointed.   As a Michelin star restaurant, Linhart is the right place to celebrate special occasions. I would like to extend a special word of thanks to Marcela, who helped me in the planning stage and welcomed us with her warmth, and to Chef Uroš, whose delicious creations will never be forgotten.   Thank you, we will definitely be back!  ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274879-d23569931-r890403065-Hisa_Linhart_Restavracija_Hotel-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,5,en

2024-08-10,Julio S,"It is a restaurant located at the entrance of the hotel of the same name, on very uncomfortable tables and in low light. They try to bring you the wine directly without offering you the menu, which has happened to me in several places in Slovenia. The wine list is correct, but not broad. We took the menu of 7 courses, of which only a couple of them stood out, the rest, nothing special. Normal desserts The price is very very expensive for what their dishes offer.

2024-01-12,marione59,"If you want to spend a different New Year's Eve or simply a special evening away from the usual routes, if you want to lose yourself in an authentic dimension that smacks of times gone by, if you want to rediscover forgotten emotions or if you simply want to eat well, you are in the right place. Hîsa Linhart can offer you all this and more. Rightly awarded the Michelin star (one of nine in the whole of Slovenia to have received the precious recognition) but also the green star of sustainability, it is the restaurant of the inn of the same name housed in an ancient building in the town of Radovljica, a stone's throw from the celebrated lake Bled. Landscapes with the unmistakable connotation typical of Alpine valleys, where woods and pastures are surrounded by mountains often covered in snow. We are just over 600 meters above sea level but thanks to the scent and clarity of the air it seems like we are decidedly higher. Hîsa Linhart's cuisine rightly finds its products precisely in these areas and from organic and highly sustainable farms and crops and find their sublimation here. The menus offered include 5, 7 or 9 courses. It's true...it's New Year's Eve but the choice of seven courses will prove to be the right choice, the right compromise between hunger and gluttony. Mountain cuisine, certain cuisine, is particularly captivating also because it uses materials that can only be found in these places, materials that have the scent and flavor of natural, healthy, intact things. And the dishes, all the dishes on our menu will not betray this promise. The service is enhanced by the affability and professionalism of the kind owner of the restaurant who always presented the dishes to us in perfect Italian with precision and friendliness. A stop that allowed us to spend New Year's Eve in a new and unexpected way, in a different and original dimension, in tranquility savoring the proposals of excellent cuisine, far from the balls with unthinkable menus and crazy prices Thank you Hîsa Linhart, we really had a great time! Too bad the rain then ruined the street party...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274879-d23569931-r933796152-Hisa_Linhart_Restavracija_Hotel-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,4,en
