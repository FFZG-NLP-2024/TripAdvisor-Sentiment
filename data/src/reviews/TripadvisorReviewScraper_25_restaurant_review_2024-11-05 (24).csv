Our dinner was truly outstanding, the best that we have had this year even exceeding our dinner at Mirazur (and that for about half the price I shall add). The dining room was modern, well designed and spacious. Staff made every effort and succeeded in making us comfortable the entire evening. The sommelier presented us with three excellent very well chosen wines. And the food, well the food was the absolutely outstanding menu des Specialites. We enjoyed every single dish and were unable to find even the smallest fault. If Monsieur Aribert is cooking like this every day then the third star will be awarded very soon.

Obviously the meal was sublime, the plates were beautifully prepared, the blend of flavors a permanent discovery, the cooking of the fish a treat.

Sorry, my friends, we didn't know that we were going to share a small tartlet (the size of a small bowl, 6 cm in diameter) into 4 for our dessert. What can we say about the piece of pigeon, the only meat dish, the size of a lady's thumb, a lady not in good health, 2 small, very small bites. 2 Michelin stars!!! maybe these were just samples?
Will we go back to check it out? useless, the cheese platter only contained goat cheese, only! I don't like goat.

Original flavors, surprises while combining local products with great inventiveness.
We manage to make us like products that we don’t necessarily like, which proves that it’s a very good table ☺️

We didn't take it.","0","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-08-05","2023-08-04","en","Maison Aribert","16725683","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g811243-d16725683-r907917257-Maison_Aribert-Saint_Martin_d_Uriage_Isere_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"
