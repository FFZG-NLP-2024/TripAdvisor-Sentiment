The three-Michelin-starred Cocina Hermanos Torres in Barcelona, ​​Spain, was built in 2018 in a dilapidated tire factory in the Les Corts neighborhood of Barcelona and is run by twins Sergio and Javier Torres. The reason why the top overall decoration design (high ceiling) is supported by a steel frame and the open kitchen (there is no wall or counter between the kitchen and the guests) is due to their desire to fully restore their childhood memories of their grandmother's house (Catalina's upper-class family cook) or what they claim to be their dream ship - ""A kitchen of values ​​and flavors"" In 1986 Sergio went to Orrery in London and Javier went to El Racó de Can Fabes and Mugaritz for an apprenticeship. Then in 2008, the brothers opened their first joint restaurant Dos Cielos in Barcelona. The influence brought by this initial restaurant made them TV celebrities in Spain, hosting their own cooking show and appearing in other cooking and lifestyle programs.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/ee/9f/5d/caption.jpg","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r977138975-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

Atmosphere: 1","Beware of Unfair and Unhelpful Hospitality Practices at Cocina Hermanos Torres","I’m writing this review to warn potential diners about the disappointing and unfair experience I had with Cocina Hermanos Torres in Barcelona. I hope others will read this and be aware of the questionable reservation practices and lack of transparency that I experienced firsthand for a dining experience I didn’t even get to eat! 

During my first trip to Spain, I used the American Express Dining Concierge where the concierge assistant placed me on a WAITLIST for a few time slots at this restaurant. The understanding from the concierge was clear: I would receive a call from the restaurant to confirm if any slot opened up. I only ever received emails saying no slots were available.

To my complete shock, I later got a call from the restaurant asking if I was on my way—something I was totally unaware of. There was no phone call nor communication notifying me that a reservation had been confirmed. How does a 3 Michelin Star restaurant that is supposed to be known for its service not call to confirm reservations nor ask if we have any food allergies prior to dining? 

A few weeks later, I discovered a $608.07 charge on my credit card for a no-show! This situation has been extremely distressing. I reached out via multiple emails and phone calls to resolve the issue amicably, but unfortunately, the restaurant staff was neither helpful nor understanding. (Because I tried to ask my credit card company to help and they also had trouble reaching out to the restaurant, this attempt at a resolution has been dragged out for a year!) 

The American Express Concierge confirmed that I was simply on a waitlist and never agreed to a confirmed reservation without notification. Additionally, the reservation system didn’t follow standard protocols—no confirmation call, no inquiry about food allergies, which is especially alarming given my travel companion’s severe coconut allergy. Had we unknowingly dined and any food contained coconut, it could’ve been dangerous.

To make matters worse, the restaurant’s emails were completely written in Spanish and provided no warning about: 1) charges for a no-show if a waitlist slot becomes available, 2) how the waitlist transitions to a confirmed reservation, and 3) ANY protocol to confirm reservations with the diner directly [since there most definitely should be a confirmation from the diner that they’re aware of the (newly) confirmed reservation and that they’re even alive]. 

Despite my attempts to explain the misunderstanding, the restaurant showed no compassion or effort to address the issue or find an amicable resolution. I even asked if we could potentially find a way to credit for a future dining experience, if I could come back to Spain, and they completely rejected any idea of this. Their refusal to help resolve the situation has left me feeling scammed, especially given the reputation of such a prestigious Michelin-starred establishment. This experience is a far cry from the level of care and professionalism I’ve come to expect from fine dining.

I strongly advise anyone considering Cocina Hermanos Torres to proceed with caution. If this restaurant cannot offer transparency in their reservation policies, it leaves diners vulnerable to unexpected and unjust charges. My experience has been both emotionally and financially burdensome, and I hope others won’t have to deal with the same.

Avoid this restaurant unless you’re ready to deal with potentially confusing and unfair practices—and don’t expect them to care about resolving issues if you become ill, an emergency happens, or something goes wrong.","1","","FRIENDS","2023-11-30","2024-10-17","2024-10-16","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r974232282-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

Nothing was exceptional and some dishes were bad. The lamb was so chewy I had to spit it out. A lot of the seafood tasted off. The dessert courses were mostly pieces of candy. The service was not great. I had to ask for more water and we waited 20 minutes for the check. None of this is acceptable for the cost of the meal. We should have canceled the reservation in the days prior when they emailed asking if we wanted to order their shoes or add a rose to the meal.

The bar area/seating are excellent, staff very friendly and attentive. Aperitif in the bar, then you are taken to your table. Tables arranged around the central finishing kitchen, as open as you can get - such a great concept. 16 courses of some of the best food I have ever tasted - certainly puts this restaurant at the No1 best restaurant I have visited. Wine paring, food, staff even the owner greeted every guest personally and thanked them for coming - which I found doesn’t ever happen at Michelin starred places - but thought it was such a nice touch. If you want some of the best food you’ll taste in the world, visit here.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/5e/6e/ac/caption.jpg

There were a few things that I didn't expect from a 3 star (especially just having come from San Sebastian's Martin Besarategui:

1. Homophobic treatment - the servers gave explanations for 15 of the 16 courses except for the 14th course the Cocoa Age where they simply said ""okay, congratulations"", dropped the plate off without explanations, and quickly walked away
2. The sommelier just asked what wine I wanted, red or white, and brought something for us to try. I'm a certified wine professional with a WSET 3 passed with distinction, and out of the 75+ Michelin starred restaurants, I've not seen this nonchalant service
3. At the end of the meal, they just left me and my partner waiting. Never came by to ask whether we wanted any tea or anything else (a pretty normal, hospitable gesture)...so we constantly had to try to make eye contact with someone to try to get them to give us our check after 15-20 mins of waiting.","1","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-18","2024-07-18","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r960106729-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

My wife and I had a reservation at opening time and when the black shears parted and we were escorted into the restaurant, wow, we were blown away.  The setting was like something from a dream.  The dark wall coverings juxtaposed with the fluorescent lights shining down on the cooking stations in the middle of the restaurant, the professional wait staff attired in black suits and custom-made red leather high top sneakers.  

My wife and I had never dined at a Michelin-starred restaurant (let alone one with three stars), so we clearly won’t be the most knowledgeable reviewer, but we were blown away.  We opted for the standard wine pairing with the multi-course dinner and enjoyed every morsel/sip.  The service – both the food servers and the sommelier – was outstanding, the experience was beyond compare.  We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and a nice personalized dessert was delivered along with a subtle, muted round of applause from the staff.  Nice touch – understated, as appropriate.  

I feared that I would have “buyer’s remorse” the morning after (after spending far, far more for dinner than we ever had before), but I had none.

Despite clear communication, the restaurant failed to honor the advertised testing menu price, insisting on a significantly higher cost due to a Mobile World Congress event. This lack of transparency and flexibility regarding pricing left me unable to proceed with my reservation. Furthermore, the apparent disregard for customer concerns suggest a lack of hospitality and empathy, qualities one would expect from a restaurant of a three-star Michelin.

Additionally, the restaurant's decision to use the Mobile World Congress event as an excuse to raise the price post-booking, rather than informing customers beforehand, is unacceptable. Despite sending three reminders to cancel my reservation and avoid my credit card being charged, there was no acknowledgment or response from the restaurant. This lack of attentiveness to customer requests further underscores the disappointing experience. True excellence in the culinary world extends beyond the food itself to encompass the entire dining experience, including customer service and communication. Regrettably, Cocina Hermanos Torres fell short in this regard, casting doubt on its suitability for recognition as a top-tier establishment.","1","","BUSINESS","2024-02-29","2024-02-25","2024-02-25","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r939748728-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

Every course was prepared with the uppermost attention to detail, creativity, freshest food selection, and exquisite culinary design. I had the best cod and duck in my life tonight. I have dined at Michelin 3 star in Paris and Cocina Hermanos Torres strikes me with a unique, whimsical ambiance and space. The open kitchen concept is not easy to execute if you think about it - with guests looking/judging/staring at the chefs who are cooking in the middle of the room. Overall, I really appreciate the effort of the chef, his team, and the service staff. I would come back again if I am in Barcelona next time.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/6d/0d/52/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-14","2024-02-14","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r938316717-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

However communication was poor, before and during dinner , we felt tricked. I reserved 4 months ago, at that time we had several pricing options, yesterday only the most expensive option at 295€. Furthermore during dinner w a menu w 20 dishes, they said if u want some pasta with truffles, just let us know. We said yes as we did not know they would charge us  on top of the 295 / pers menu. When i got the bill i found out that they charged us 333€ extra just for the pasta w truffles, it is not acceptable for a 3 * michelin, u feel betrayed and somehow it ruins the great  experience u just got. After complaining at least they waved the extra charge.","3","","FAMILY","2023-12-31","2023-12-29","2023-12-29","en","Cocina Hermanos Torres","14783967","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d14783967-r931395832-Cocina_Hermanos_Torres-Barcelona_Catalonia.html"

We find out that we never heard of Cocina Hermanos Torres before and we have been to Barcelona more than 20 times.
It was nice to see that the place is a 3 Michelin star restaurant, so we thought we were in for a great evening ... and we was :-)
Every dish was just perfect.
Service was out of this world.

Period.","The dining experiences of all dining experiences in all facets!!

The food, the service, the wine pairing, the atmosphere - is all WOW. 

Going in, we honestly had no idea what to expect. This was recommended by a friend and we truly had no idea what the concept was, just reserved and showed up. (Not something I normally do, but hey when you trust a friends taste buds…)

Beyond happy we went and experienced every second of what this extraordinary restaurant had to offer and will be recommending it to any of our friends who travel to Barcelona! 

Pablo with the hospitality. 
Maria with the wine.

The piparras and smoke anchovy bonbon, crispy rubia gallega and Iberian ham and seafood salad, potato and kohlrabi danced in your mouth and had a slightly unexpected spicy finish. The mussels 'moqueca' prawns and king crab and the suckling lamb were favourites.

The attention to detail could not have been better. You never felt hovered over and you never noticed the waiters look directly at your table, and yet everything  was handled expeditiously. For instance, they observed that my partner and I are both left-handed and arranged the silverware accordingly.

I especially appreciated 1 of the brothers (twins run the establishment) came at the beginning of the meal and shook our hand. On another occasion, we asked for a picture to be taken of us, and magically both brothers appeared behind us for the picture.

Also of note, everyone wears read shoes that say the name of the restaurant a d indicates the 3 Michelin stars, which they so rightly earned.

It was truly a wonderful night. Thank you.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/93/01/07/caption.jpg

I love that the restaurant has open kitchen. Every staff you meet at the restaurant greets you with a big smile. Even though the restaurant has 3 star, the ambiance is more friendly and relaxed. Even the chef came to say hi. The menu is diverse in terms of taste, texture, ingredients and where the dishes came from. It is well presented, very modern and most importantly scrumptious. We loved every course that was presented to us. And the servers explains the idea behind each dish, ingredients and how to eat them. The mocktails are prepared based on your liking which I really loved. They were kind enough to accommodate me and my husbands dietary restrictions. This is not just a restaurant but eating here is an experience. I highly recommend it.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/8d/70/63/caption.jpg
