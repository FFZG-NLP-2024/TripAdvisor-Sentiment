King's Joy has my favorite way of eating - small dishes of variety. Plus the service is simply impeccable. Our head waiter (Romas) did a wonderful job providing professional attention and great details. I am looking forward to coming back next time I'll be in Beijing.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-05","2024-10-05","en","King's Joy","3330316","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r972624967-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html"

Atmosphere: 5","So Amazing We Went Twice","My wife and I returned just last night from three weeks in China. King's Joy was one of our highlights so I wanted to write a review while our experience is still fresh.

Our hotel (Mandarin Oriental - stay there!) recommended King's Joy when we asked for the best vegetarian restaurants. We had no idea we were going to a three Michelin star restaurant nor what we were in for. What we were in for was a delicious culinary adventure with edible art and extraordinary service. This is a 100% vegetarian restaurant (that can easily do vegan if you wish) and will impress even the most picky of meat eaters. It is extraordinary what the chefs can do with vegetables.

First, the location is perfect. Just across the road from a Ming Dynasty temple, King's Joy sits quietly amongst a bustling Beijing cityscape. You could walk right past the restaurant and have no idea what was inside. It is a remodeled courtyard home from ages ago, and its modern elegance hides its ancient past. Amazing spot to eat!

Secondly, the food is as beautiful as it is delicious. Each portion is small but I promise you, you will leave full. The servers explain what you are eating as they bring it out, all of it local, all of it delicious. You get so many flavors and textures your tastebuds will explode in the best ways possible.

Thirdly, and certainly not last, the service is impeccable. Our server the first night, a *super* friendly and knowledgable guy named Jack, was as impressionable as the food and played a huge role in our decision to come back and dine there again. He spoke perfect English and was a wealth of information and friendliness. Should you choose to dine at King's Joy - and you should - request Jack as your main server; he truly felt like a friend and was a significant part of our experience.

Please, do yourself a favor and dine at this restaurant during your stay in Beijing. Should we visit the city again we will absolutely eat here again - twice at least.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-23","2024-09-23","en","King's Joy","3330316","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r971095692-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html"

I made reservation while I was in the U.S.,  suppose be a good treat for my dad who I didn’t see for 7 years.  But boy what a disappointment , first of all they force you to pick same price /set course menu for all people on the table, which is limited the option to try different things. They have 3 sets of menu with different prices. My dad was upset about that but I was still hope the food is good, but the disappointment continues, same material repeat on most of dishes, basically tofu, bamboo or mushrooms , tastes is not good at all,  I was really questioning how they even got 3 Michelin stars?!

Atmosphere: 3","King's Joy with a bit of Peasant's Sadness/ 皇家的喜悦与农民的悲伤","For my wife’s birthday, we wanted a dining experience as special as the occasion itself during our stay in Beijing. We chose ""King's Joy,"" a renowned vegetarian restaurant celebrated for its culinary artistry and elegant ambiance—think big plates, small food, live music, and everything else that accompanies what seemed like sophisticated dining. While the restaurant largely lived up to its reputation, a few aspects left us with mixed feelings.

Highlights

From the moment we entered King's Joy, the ambiance set a tone of serene elegance. The restaurant's decor, a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and traditional Chinese design, created a warm and inviting atmosphere. Soft lighting and tasteful decor added to the intimate and cozy feeling, making it an ideal setting for our celebration.

The food at King's Joy was nothing short of exceptional. The highlight of our meal was the ""Nostoc Maize Grain in Burdock,"" a dish that perfectly showcased the chef's ability to elevate simple vegetarian ingredients into something truly extraordinary.

Adding to the enchanting atmosphere was a live harp performance by a talented musician near our table. Her soothing melodies provided a beautiful, calming backdrop to our meal, enhancing the overall experience and making our celebration feel even more special.

Another highlight of our dinner was the waiter who served us. His English was good, and although we had difficulty hearing his explanations of each dish clearly (we were seated right besides the harpist), he maintained a high level of professionalism and courtesy throughout the evening.

Peasant's Sadness

It is at this point that we, the peasants, experienced sadness. Despite the many positives, our experience was marred by a few disappointing moments. Some staff members appeared to be amused by our attempts to navigate the nuances of the ""cuisine sino-française haut de gamme"" and our unfamiliarity with certain dining customs. As visitors from the West, this behavior made us feel self-conscious and somewhat uncomfortable (no hard feelings, ladies; just try to be a bit more discreet...).

Moreover, we were seated at a large table for six, right in the middle of the restaurant, rather than at a smaller, more intimate table for two as we had hoped. This central location detracted significantly from the private and reclusive ambiance we had envisioned for our celebration.

Conclusion

In a sense, ""King's Joy"" offers a remarkable dining experience with its exquisite food, serene ambiance, and delightful live music. It stands as a top destination for those looking to celebrate special occasions with vegetarian cuisine in Beijing. However, the occasional lapses in respectful service and the less-than-ideal seating arrangements slightly dampened what could have been a flawless evening. Despite these issues, ""King's Joy"" remains a worthy choice for a more-than-average dining experience.

-----------

在北京旅行期间，为了庆祝我妻子的生日，我们想要一个与这特殊时刻相匹配的特别的用餐体验。我们选择了 “京兆尹”，一 家以其烹饪艺术和优雅氛围而闻名的素食餐厅——想象一下大盘子、小食物、现场音乐，以及所有看起来像是精致用餐的一切。虽然餐厅在很大程度上达到了它的声誉，但某些方面让我们有些失望。

优点

从我们踏入京兆尹的那一刻起，氛围就营造出一种宁静的优雅。餐厅的装饰，现代精致与传统中式设计的和谐结合，营造了一个温馨而令人愉悦的环境。柔和的灯光和精美的装饰增加了温馨和舒适的感觉，使它成为我们庆祝的理想场所。

京兆尹的食物简直是无与伦比的。我们这顿饭的亮点是 “黄花菜玉米粒搭配牛蒡”，这道菜完美展示了厨师将简单的素食食材提升为真正非凡的能力。

为我们用餐增添魅力的是一位才华横溢的音乐家在我们桌旁演奏的竖琴。她舒缓的旋律为我们的晚餐提供了一个美丽、平静的背景，增强了整体体验，使我们的庆祝活动显得更加特别。现场音乐为这次晚餐增添了个性化和优雅的色彩。

我们晚上的另一个亮点是为我们服务的服务员。他的英语非常流利，尽管由于我们离竖琴手很近，很难清楚地听到他对每道菜的解释，但他整个晚上都保持了高度的专业性和礼貌。

农民的悲伤

在这一点上，我们这些农民感到了悲伤。尽管有很多优点，我们的体验却被一些令人失望的时刻所掩盖。某些工作人员似乎对我们尝试理解 “高档中法混合料理” 和我们对某些用餐习俗的不熟悉感到有些好笑。作为来自西方的游客，这种行为让我们感到不自在和有点不安（没有恶意，女士们；只是希望你们能更隐晦一点)。在一家像京兆尹这样声名显赫的餐厅中，遇到这种不专业的行为令人惊讶。

此外，我们被安排在餐厅中间的一张六人桌，而不是我们所希望的更小、更亲密的双人桌。这种中央位置显著地削弱了我们对庆祝活动的私人和隐蔽氛围的预期。我们发现自己处在活动的中心，工作人员和顾客经常经过，这使我们很难享受我们为这特殊晚上所期望的温馨、隐蔽的氛围。

结论

从某种意义上说，“京兆尹”提供了一个卓越的用餐体验，其美味的食物、宁静的氛围和迷人的现场音乐使其成为在北京庆祝特殊场合的素食餐饮的首选之地。然而，偶尔的不尊重服务和不理想的座位安排略微影响了本来可能是完美的夜晚。尽管存在这些问题，“京兆尹” 仍然是一次愉快的用餐体验的值得推荐的选择。","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/97/22/f5/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Unexpected","King’s Joy is one of those restaurants that try to offer a culinary journey across their country, using a tasting, set menu.  There is no question that the food has been exquisite, and it does indeed offer a chance to experience ingredients from across China.  Also, it’s worth mentioning that the menu is 100% vegetarian! 
Just like in any tasting restaurant each dish comes with a story. In this case it also comes along with an amazing presentation.   
The wine menu is impressive as mentioned by many reviewers and you will for sure find something for your taste.      
There are a few areas of improvement that I could suggest.  First off, having a sommelier available, or providing a bit of wine education for the staff would help – a lot.   Second, the food is really spectacular however some of the dishes would be even better when paired with the right drinks.  In my case I went with a Chardonnay that was great for most of the dishes, but some of the dishes clearly called out for a red wine.  It would be worthwhile for the restaurant to offer a drinks pairing menu. Third and last point, would be on providing even more training for the staff and improving on the marketing – the restaurant definitely has a story that needs to be told correctly. For non-Chinese customers, the restaurant should work a little bit on making sure the translation actually conveys the correct message!  At the end of the meal the waiter is offering dumplings or noodles.   The translation should emphasize that noodles at the end of the meal is a Chinese tradition – as you will see in many many restaurants. The waiter that attended me was speaking reasonably good English, but clearly not fluent.  His explanation of serving noodles, was to ensure clients are not hungry at the end of the meal….  With the portions being pretty small, it is possible that some customers could still be hungry by the end of the meal. Nevertheless, this is where a bit of savvy marketing would come in handy, not to mention that noodles at the end of a meal are the norm!  Also, this is an amazing vegetarian restaurant. Even more so considering it is located in China, which is not the first destination that comes to mind for vegetarian dishes.  The restaurant has some serious work to do on marketing and presentation of it’s story! 
The setting of the restaurant, the décor, the service is very nice and comfortable like you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant.  Getting in is literally taking you to another world or peace and serenity, 100% opposite to the hustle and bustle of the street.  This is not a value restaurant by any stretch of imagination.  It’s clearly designed to be an amazing experience, and that it is!
For me the experience was great, but not to die for.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/6f/3b/35/caption.jpg

The presentation, from menu to each dish, is very stylish. Service is warm, considerate and proper.

Firstly,the diner in environment perfectly matches the topic of how traditional PEK restaurant looks like, therefore, from the setting address, interior decoration & service quality,it can be seen that the owner spend his own enthusiasm for the restaurant. At least, According to the previous mentioning terms , the only Michelin three stars vegetarian restaurant is an absolute right evaluation.
Secondly, for the term of cuisine, the main course such as quinoa boletus wellington with red wine pineapple grapefruit enzymes is highly recommended, because, there is no difference between this & real steaks in taste & appearance. 
Lastly, usually having fine dinner with wine is a routine for any type of Michelin restaurant, yet, for this restaurant, it offers different juice to service corresponding cuisines. It can be marked such as unique.
However, from food, dinner in environment & service quality, the first Michelin three stars vegetarian restaurant is well-deserved.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/1d/19/82/caption.jpg

It was amazing that I had quite a walk through the garden,  like all Chinese garden, you dont't get a wide road straight to the dinning area, it was a foggy, like in A MOIVE, you have to go left and right, look at the bamboo, look the all small detalis, no one rush you to the table, that you get a piece of mind in such a busy city.

The place was huge, every one enjoys their own privacy, which I love this so much. 

Food was very good, price of wine was a bit steep, but okay. I do like their options of tea, great choices.

 Food came in decent portion, top service, my friends and I spent a peaceful afternoon,  what else do I want ? 

像竹林一樣的走廊，讓人沉澱下來，再慢慢到餐飲區，絕對是食風景的地方，殺掉了不少相片，食物也不錯，可以再來。","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/70/c3/05/like-a-heaven.jpg

Savoury platter was nice too with Chinese pasteries

Recommend to have an empty tummy before you come (skip lunch!), though there is only one piece for each sweet/ savoury to share between two, it is still in a very generous portion, you also get to choose and add extra bite whichever is your favourite one

Our server Carter was very professional and attended to details, you would never run out of tea and make sure everything is alright

Nice weather. The best service I had there was from the ladies who served tea for those waiting for being seated. I had very good tea there and liked the decor at the waiting area. That's the end of it. The food was not the best veggie food I had ever had; the lady serving our table was the least to expect. Nothing rude from her, but just not that type of services for a waitress from this restaurant. Odd that all the other waitresses we had interaction with in that restaurant were all good. That lady did not serve our table only and maybe more attention was given to the other. I thought this restaurant was a competitor to Fu (Happiness) and Hui(wisdom) in Shanghai. Turned out that I was wrong. Nothing comparable in terms of food or table service. The dish introduction was bland and common different from that at F&H in Shanghai.","2","","FAMILY","2019-10-31","2019-11-03","2019-11-03","en","King's Joy","3330316","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r723461167-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html"
