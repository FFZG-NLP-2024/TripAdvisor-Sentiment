Atmosphere: 2","At most - an interesting - but overpriced - experience.","This should be a 2 star Michelin restaurant. It isn´t.
Out of our 12course meny 5 were of Michelin star standard. 
The remaining had a nice presentation but that was it.
The wine menu was presented first by - we suppose - the sommelier but suddenly they changed to another more junior person. It contained only portugese wines, but nothing extraordinary. It was also ridiculously expensive.
The service was also very slow - we can´t understand why.
The dining room we suppose is the breakfast room of the hotel in which the restaurant is located.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r977582003-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

Atmosphere: 1","Two guide Michelin stars - absolutely not!","This review is based on ""value for money"". We paid EUR 500 per person for an experience at a two-star Michelin restaurant and Il Gallo D'oro is way off the mark. I've eaten at restaurants with one, two or three stars before, and this place is well below par.

The ambiance in the place is horrible. It feels like a conference room at the hotel where they have put a few tables. No thought has been put into creating an atmosphere worthy of a two-star restaurant.

The service is slightly below ""adequate"". The staff go through the moves in a slightly robotic fashion. No genuine feeling at all. The chef made an appearance without seeming to be interested in whether we liked the food or not. He had been told to be there, so he was.

The presentation of the food is very good and lives up to the two stars. Almost every dish is beautiful to look at and the looks are imaginative.

The dishes taste OK, but not more. A few of them are good, but the rest of them are below what you would expect from a two-star restaurant. Of course they are better than at a regular restaurant, but you expect more from a restaurant where you pay EUR 500 per person. Also, there is way too little food. I would not expect to have to eat a double-serving of bread to feel full. All dishes are VERY small. After all, I don't expect to have to go to McDonalds after paying so much for food.

Good value for money? Absolutely not and stay away!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r977037006-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

Well looked after from entering the restaurant until leaving. Tasting menu covered a range of delicious options - all well presented with descriptions of chefs thinking behind every serving. I do agree with comments made by previous reviewers in that t shirts and shorts worn by guests is inappropriate. There is also a sign indicating that mobile phones should be on silent but this is ignored by some guests and not addressed by any of the numerous staff.

Atmosphere: 1","If in doubt go elsewhere","Everything is subjective, but we honestly do not understand why this restaurant gets good reviews. It is stuffy and overpriced. 

The food looks beautiful, but the taste is nothing special, especially considering the number of fabulous restaurants on the Island that are a fraction of the price.

It has held its 2 stars for a long period, so perhaps it was just us, and many people we spoke with had been many times before.

There is little atmosphere. Everyone has to whisper. The window seats are great until it gets dark and then all you see is a reflection of yourself as there is no lighting outside. You cannot use the terrace until July! 

The servers are amazing, and explain the food and wines very well. It was just the food, whilst looking amazing, was just bland. 

As I said at the beginning of this review - everything is subjective, but if you are in doubt, don't spend the money to come here - go to one of the local restaurants that have a great atmosphere, are more romantic in terms of setting, and have arguably better tasting food.  

My 2 stars are purely for the service.","1","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-15","2024-06-15","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r955251715-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

This time we chose the “8 Moments” Top  Experience tasting menu with paired wines, which, as always, was excellent, and it was good to experience some new dishes since our visit last year.

We think that the ambience of the restaurant is stylish and modern but comfortable, with large windows overlooking the ocean. The staff, led by the Maîte d' André Pinto, are always professional, attentive, friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere was relaxing. The sommelier is very knowledgeable and helpful.

A wonderful fine-dining experience.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/92/59/0e/caption.jpg

The desert carousel is such a lovely touch!

Service was excellent.
Food, choice of two menus.

Each course was a delight and explained fully by the waiting staff.
Beautifully presented and a taste sensation.
Small restaurant, on our visit only 12 tables…
Expensive…yes.
Value for money… speculative 
If you are having a special occasion and staying at the hotel…highly recommended!

Dish by dish, with glass by glass, it was clever, delicious and visually fantastic. Topped off at the end by brilliant presentation of a personal birthday cake offering for my wife. This brought a tear of joy to her face. All in all an exquisite experience.","0","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-25","2024-02-25","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r939710386-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

Atmosphere: 4","A Culinary Experience","Stepping into Il Gallo d'Oro, located in the Cliff Hotel, we immediately sensed that we were in for a culinary experience unlike any other. The ambiance exuded elegance and sophistication. Only about 15 tables and everyone dressed impeccably. Yes, it is an expensive restaurant but well worth every Euro. We decided not to go for the Tasting Menu but opted for the A La Carte choice. The meal began with a delightful Couvert, offering a selection of breads accompanied by an assortment of four butter flavours: regular, black octopus ink, garlic, and Madeira red wine, along with some local olive oil. This thoughtful introduction showcased the restaurant's commitment to creativity and attention to detail. We were then presented with an amuse-bouche of espada with onions and red pepper. The delicate flavours of the espada, combined with the sweetness of the onions and the red pepper were amazing. For starters, we went for the lobster avocado cannelloni with gazpacho pearls and caviar. Each bite was a was a taste explosion. For the main course, my wife opted for the pigeon smoked with eucalyptus and cinnamon, while I chose the dover sole steak with tortellini and a prawn bisque sauce. The pigeon was presented within a box that when opened filled the place with its smoky aroma and subtle hints of eucalyptus. The sole was so tender and the sauce so flavoursome. For dessert I had the biscuit box and my wife the daisy.
Throughout our dining experience, the service at Il Gallo d'Oro was impeccable. All the staff were attentive and knowledgeable, even the Host, ensuring that every aspect of our meal was flawlessly executed and that we felt truly pampered from start to finish.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/7a/f2/26/caption.jpg

We opted for the Terroir Experience (11 moments) with champagne, wines, and drinks.

On the positives, the sommelier was extremely professional, knowledgeable and pleasant to interact with. Our wine was corked (which happens, it’s just naturally and inevitable), but he dealt with it very well and with such a natural response that was pure joy to observe, very professional.

However, the service by the servers was not immaculate and to the level reasonably expected in a stared restaurant, and there were weaknesses (though not for a single moment would I doubt the best intentions of the personnel, who were pleasant and nice, but simply not adequate for a stared restaurant, so it is assumed to be a matter of training).

Food-wise, while I recognise that it is subjective, compared to other stared restaurants we have visited before, I can understand how 1 star could be warranted. However I simply cannot justify 2 stars on any front, and it felt like there were some issues on consistency and execution was some way away from perfection. Same goes for the price-tag, which does not feel like it is proportionately supported by the substance and quality of the dishes. 

Therefore, while I am pleased to have tried this restaurant, I am not currently in a position to recommend it as a stared restaurant that is worth a visit. Equally, I would not class it as a value-for-money restaurant, in the sense that you do not get adequate return for the prices charged.","2","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2023-12-31","2023-12-31","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r931846047-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"

One of the party is a coeliac, I  checked that their website was able to cater for her  and also emailed for confirmation that it was OK.
On the night, they simply  removed any sauces from the menu ( we all had the 8 course tasting  225  euro menu), and her gluten free bread had the texture and appearance of profiteroles, hollow inside. Given that the hotel that we are staying in can prepare a daily breakfast basket of many diferent kinds of breads and pastries and cakes, this and the missing sauces made her feel not particularly welcomed .
The staff are lovely and very attentive, but as the host I could just feel the whole celebratory evening slipping away,  and would say that it was a very disappointing evening not just for her but the various dishes were confused with perhaps simply too many elements on them.
I don't regularly do reviews and when I do it's usually because we've had such a great meal, but today is simply because it wasn't great, it used to be , and maybe the mantra 
 ' less is more' could be considered going forward, but I probably won't be there to find out.

One of our 8 courses was a plate filled with stones and two chips plus two small leaves. Some of the courses offered little more than that, but what all of them had in common is that they were made for the picture, but sadly not for the taste of it. The final course was offered as a beautiful tower made of china, but the food once more was a disappointment: plain bonbons, no better than those from the supermarket. The restaurant is pretentious, but it could not at all fulfill our expectations.","2","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-11-18","2023-11-18","en","Il Gallo D'oro","1427159","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r926464353-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html"
