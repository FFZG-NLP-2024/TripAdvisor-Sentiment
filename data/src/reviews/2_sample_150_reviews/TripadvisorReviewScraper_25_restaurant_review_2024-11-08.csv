We started with cocktails and canapés at the bar. We had the renouveau menu, but we didn't expect to have so much food, and we are good forks! It was quite new for us to not see the menu, so we didn't know what to expect, but definitely the chef knows what he is doing! They gives us few surprise dishes, as well !!! In the end of the evening we enjoy, laugh and we was full, actually we couldn't move 🤣","0","","FRIENDS","2023-01-31","2023-01-04","2023-01-04","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r873957186-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Food: 2","Painful to review because the servers were great but...","I want to begin by giving a shout out to the two VERY hard woking servers at this restaurant.  They were fantastic.  They were also put in a very bad position the evening we were there.  We arrived at 7:30 per the request of the restaurant.  We left at midnight.  They offered a vegetarian menu.  My husband chose the regular menu.  The starters, all the same typical of France, were not vegetarian (which is OK for me), and they were OK. Fish, foie gras, etc.  But here is the disappointing part: next course for me: one mushroom, sliced in pieces and with a mushroom consommé.  My husband: squid noodles, cooked right there in front of us, pretty good.  Next course: Me: one...one small ravioli called an original ""French minestrone""-that was undercooked in a cold cabbage broth that tasted like nothing else but cabbage.  Now we are at 10:30pm in the evening.   The bread was dry and had been cut way before the meal.  My husband had pigeon, again, OK.  The rest?  I don't even remember. Again: the two servers, a young man and a young woman, were so kind and nice, got us a taxi (at midnight)...but what the heck?  Surely you can do better than this!  Don't offer a vegetarian menu if you can't support it.  I'm not a true vegetarian, but I can only imagine how upset I would be if I was...and really, over four hours for this food was not acceptable. It's not an easy restaurant to get to and expensive cab ride-40 E each way). I hated writing this because the servers were fantastic, but it was a bad experience due to the food.","0","","NONE","2022-10-31","2022-10-10","2022-10-10","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r863984632-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

A no choice 5 or 7 course tasting menu opened with a seris of canapés.  We were able to have one 5 course and one 7 Course menu, something many restaurants refuse but here,  everything was possible.  
An excellent white wine from St. Emilion (!) was quite the discovery! 
Service we slick,  friendly and professional.  Many dishes were prepared tableside. Well done for that!

It was certainly different! Having eaten at a number of Michelin star restaurants across the world, this one stood out for all the wrong reasons.

We booked for 8pm but arrived 15 minutes early to have a drink, to find the doors closed. It was cold evening, but the staff made us wait outside until 8pm, along with the other couple who had booked that evening. Not exactly a warm welcome!!

We chose the 6-course tasting menu which can be best described as ‘good in parts’. The dishes were experimental. Some were delicious (the Octopus) and some were really not pleasant at all (the white asparagus). There was no meat course, as this had been replaced by the white asparagus. I ate more than my wife as I found her passing many elements of each dish to me...

Service was good, although one member of staff’s  approach to service was a little off-hand. The lad who served us spoke excellent English and was genuinely welcoming and he offered us either pigeon or cheese when he realised that we did not like the white asparagus.

Le Prince Noir clearly has a very good reputation locally, so perhaps we went on a bad night. We’ll never know, because we won’t be booking there again.","2","","NONE","2019-04-30","2019-04-14","2019-04-14","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r666400576-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

","What makes a good restaurant? The food obviously. Check. A real but warm welcome. Check. Excellent service that's attentive but not intrusive, friendly but not invasive, present but unseen. Check. A nice setting..... Hmmmmm a dark, rainy night doesn't help clarify that. An atmosphere you can relax in. Check.

Often a Michelin star can raise expectations. Having been deeply disappointed a few days before, I was a little nervous going here. I needn't have been. The staff were genuine, smiled and laughed, asked me about the food and wine, listening and taking my limited opinion into account. They were attentive but not overbearing. Eating alone doesn't bother me, I do however wonder if this doesn't sometimes put extra pressure on the staff. The atmosphere was lovely and the music excellent. They even turned up the volume a little for me... I was glad to be in the corner looking outwards as my back couldn't see others' reactions to my seated dancing.

The food was not perfect, some over salty, some a little bland. However these were parts of individual dishes and not the whole. I'd gladly return to the very smokey pork dish or the flavoursome scallops. The meal was extravagant in a good way, quality ingredients, well cooked, flavoursome, and at times adventurous. Sometimes too adventurous for my palate, but worthy of respect for trying, and mostly succeeding. The wine accompanying each dish working in harmony with the flavours on the plate. The food was a good 4*, the overall 5* easily coming from the staff, atmosphere, the 'feeling' engendered by the whole.

It's not an easy place to find (thank the GPS in the taxi), but it's worth the effort.

Food: 5","Magical Michelin-Starred Restaurant in Bordeaux","We booked dinner at Le Prince Noir to celebrate our friends' wedding anniversary while on vacation in Bordeaux, and it was the perfect spot.  It is a short taxi ride outside of the heart of Bordeaux (across the river/estuary).  The setting is beautiful, and the restaurant a stunning mix of old (the castle) and new (the modern glass addition for the restaurant).  The food (we did the tasting menu) was exceptional, and the tables well-spaced; the restaurant was full, but we felt like we were eating alone.  One of our party is a vegetarian, which I had neglected to inform the restaurant of in advance (oops), and they did a wonderful job on no notice in creating a delicious and creative vegetarian meal.  The service was terrific, and the views of the surrounding grounds spectacular.  This is a terrific restaurant for a special occasion.","0","","COUPLES","2017-10-31","2017-10-24","2017-10-24","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r535695985-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Food: 5","Wonderful, lived up to the expectation","This restaurant is a one star Michelin place, and therefore serves good food, offers good service (and is expensive) . It lived up to the expectation

In the evening they just offer their two tasting menus, one of 5 courses and one of eight courses. We chose the 5 course menu and found even that was almost more than we could eat.

The setting is breath-taking - but you do need to have a table in the half of the restaurant with the picture windows. Ask to be seated there when you reserve. We had a view over the château, and as night fell, the château was floodlit

The staff are very good, friendly and polite, without being over friendly nor obsequious.. Personally I found their uniform a bit odd, the men in jeans and white trainers, and the girls in red dresses and white trainers

The menu changes weekly, so you are unlikely to have what we had, but take it from me, the flavour, quality and presentation of the food is outstanding.. We had a bottle of wine , rather than the selection of different wines you can have with each course. For a Michelin star restaurant, the wines are reasonably priced

It was a bit difficult to find, my GPS did not have the street given in their address. I put in a neighbouring street, and that got me to close enough, where we were able to pick up the street location signs for it. Once you get to it, there is ample parking, and you just walk into  the château via the marked signs

All in all a wonderful evening","0","","COUPLES","2017-07-31","2017-07-26","2017-07-26","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r505795555-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

I have been been fortunate enough to dine at many places where the food is delicious, but the staff and service is what sets Le Prince Noir in a class of its own.  There are a few points that stand out for me:

Decor: you walk in and there is beautiful artwork all around.  Everything in the restaurant has been chosen with care from the foosball table/bread cutting board, to the vintage Nintendo Game Machine in the corner (complete with sofas so you can actually play!)

Child-friendly:seeing my three year old and six year old go into the kitchen to order their meal with Vivien Durand is a sight I will remember for a long time.  The children's meal was delicious, healthy, and they ate every single bite.  I was so happy to see my children exposed to such a meticulously prepared meal. In between courses, my children were happily playing in the sculpture garden behind and no one even blinked an eye at children running around.

Servers:the servers were knowledgable, friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  They made great recommendations with the food and wine pairings.  

The FOOD: Each bite was a delight and I was sad when I was too full to eat more.  Each dish was carefully and exquisitely prepared.

One of the servers said that they wanted to make their restaurant feel like home -- they have definitely succeeded in making a fantastic, yet comfortable dining experience.","0","","FAMILY","2017-07-31","2017-07-13","2017-07-13","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r501716702-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Each course was magnificent all served by a very professional, courteous, and friendly staff.  No surprise it's a Michelin star restaurant.  We were a group and were able to be seated in a private room.

Entering the restaurant you are warmly welcomed by the team, who kindly show you to your table. The ambiance is wonderful, perfect both for romantic dinners as well as larger celebrations.
The restaurant's interior is a nice mix of modern and natural. The overall view is modern with lots of little details that I loved, like the big wooden table on which we were where we were served in stone like dishes with modern shapes. Each dish having its own identity.
We were comfortably seated at our table and the waiter presented us with a smile the restaurant and prepared us for our 8 course discovery menu. I loved the team at the Prince Noir, it was a pleasure to be served by people who adore what they are doing. 
We were guided by the restaurant's team into an explosion of tastes and aromas. All dishes were beautifully presented and coupled with a perfectly selected glass of wine.
I was wonderfully surprised by the taste of so many dishes in our menu. The Chef has managed to bring out the taste of every product and garnish it in a way to bring out the best of it. I loved all dishes. The cooking techniques and mix of ingredients and products was in perfect balance. I savored each and every bite and even though 2 weeks passed since, I am still remembering some of the dishes and I can say that it is nothing less than the finest dinning experience I have ever had. 

Thank you!!!","2","","FRIENDS","2016-04-30","2016-04-19","2016-04-19","en","Restaurant le Prince Noir","1197354","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r365307826-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Food: 5","Modern dining room with classic French dishes","We picked this restaurant as a lunch stop off on our way to Toulouse, due to the one-star rating in the 2015 Michelin Guide. 

We enjoyed the superb (and huge!) Menu Degustation. It was pricy, as expected, but the dishes on offer were varied and exceptional. Some items tested our palate more than others - the cold oxtail soup with mussels for example, but we enjoyed trying things we would not necessarily have chosen ourselves. 

The service was polite and efficient. The setting (in the new glass room) was delightful and modern, the staff spoke great English as well. 

Perhaps the tasting menu was a little on the large size - by the time our duck main arrived were were nearly full, and the deserts were not as good as some we had in France this particular time, but overall It was a superb dining experience and we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/d0/62/87/le-chateau-du-prince.jpg

Very original welcome with aperitif in an adjoining room and comfortable armchairs! We were invited to sit down at the table and the flavor festival started! 
Everything was good! An immersion menu and a vegetable menu for me! It was excellent from all points of view: presentations, flavor blends, discoveries. I also appreciated that the waiters put their hands together to prepare the dishes 
And of course the final attention for my companion’s birthday that I had pointed out at the booking: we were treated to a package in which there was a delicious Basque cake that we enjoyed the next day
