We had a table reservation at 8pm and arrived a little early so had to wait outside with others as they didn’t open till just before, upon entering we were greeted by numerous staff who were very welcoming.

All the time, longing for the day when I could taste the kind of food Massimo described in his Chef's Table video. That day finally arrived, and what a disappointment. I felt as badly as if a boyfriend had broken up with me. The heartache was real. Because we were three, we had to book a table for four, so invited a guest to drive down from Vicenza to take the fourth seat. A good thing, because visiting with her made up for the general ordinariness of the food. A good thing she and I shared one wine pairing as none of us found the wines to enhance the food, and there was no explanation from the servers. I'm glad my wish came true, but it was a lesson in  ""be careful what you wish for"" rather than a trip to gustatory nirvana.","3","","FAMILY","2024-01-31","2024-04-23","2024-04-23","en","Osteria Francescana","1160010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r948045234-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html"

Atmosphere: 1","The beetle was not part of the show","We were waiting 9 month to get a table at Osteria Francescana, the sun was shining and we had high expectations.
Once we walk into the restaurant is when the fun stops. At the entré we are met by quiet staff in black, fringed suits and on the way to our table there is a faint smell of toilet and we are touched by the thought if we have come to the right place.
We are directed into a dark room without windows and there is a beautifully set table. But it is no sound or music and the room is deafening silence. 
As we sit down, a beetle drops onto the table from the ceiling and we joke that it's part of the show. Before we can take a picture, a black suit rushes over and manages to catch the little slippery sucker and escorts it out.

When we get the menue we see that it is dedicated to Bob Dylan and wonder ironically if thats why it is so deathly quiet…
We also discover that most of Massimos signature dishes including the Five ages of parmesan and the Oops I dropped the tart, is on the a la carte menu only and not at the tasting menu.
To say it was a huge disappointment is an understatement and our joy dropped like the tart.
We chose the 12 courses menue because each dish cost 1/3 of the testing menu and we were amused over all the fun names. 
Let's put it this way, the names of the dishes on the testing menu (”This little piggy event to the Market”, ”Camoflage sud”, ”Better than popcorn come Croccantino”) were more fun than the taste.
Nothing stood out and best was the breadsticks and an extra dish one of us got due to allergy (we all four tasted, it was great).
The black suits were nice and friendly but we were served on a rolling train so we had to buckle up.
When we were waiting for the bill, we asked why it was so quiet. It turned out that they had forgotten to turn on the music and suddenly beautiful music started playing. Would the experience have been made better by music? Absolutely, to sit and eat in deafening silence is not a great experience.
Our four hour affair with Osteria Francescana ended with a sense of unfulfillment, a dissonance between the reputation and the reality we experienced.
The bill landed on 2500 euro for four persons and left us with a dull taste.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/ca/d6/24/caption.jpg

Honestly... What a joke ! Everything was bad... First, before going there, I called and asked if there was valet parking. I was told that ""there are many parking spaces in the neighbourhood"". But they did not tell me that you have to park in some dodgy streets nearby... :-( 
Then the restaurant is the old town in a beautiful house but when you get in, it's like being in a bunker ! Horrible... If you compare for example with the restaurant Fransén in Stockholm (that is also in the old town and in an old house), it's day and night !
The 7-course tasting menu should be called ""trying menu"" because it's really a struggle to try and enjoy it. I gave up at dish n°4 !  
The service was amateurish and don't get me started with the wine list that you were supposed to read on your smartphone with a QR code !!! Aha ! Good luck with that... + 100 pages or wine suggestions to read on a small screen and with a wifi / 4G connection that was very limited... 3 stars Michelin... Yeah right ! A joke... PS: we have complained and were asked to go back to try again... Complimentary of course... But I don't know if I want to go back...","0","","FRIENDS","2023-07-31","2024-03-19","2024-03-19","en","Osteria Francescana","1160010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r942878304-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html"

In the afternoon we visited Maria Luisa and were also very happy about the tour and service. Unfortunately our dinner ended in a very unfortunate way. When asked for the invoice/receipt we were told that the table was closed and we should have asked for the official document before paying! As we did not accept this situation an employee ( whose name I did not ask for and who, at this point I prefer not to include in The Team) adopted an unacceptable attitude.Nothing one could expect from any entity, far less from Osteria Francescana. It certainly is not our first visit to Michelin starred restaurants, but it is the first one where we had to tolerate a very haughty and provocative behavior. I am very sorry for this and surely will forget the dinner experience quicker than this occurrence, which I deeply regret.

It was, and still is, a very memorable dining experience! 

The quality of each item on each dish was of the highest standard, as was the extraordinary level of service, before and during our visit. I honestly don’t know how they do it for the money! 

We loved it both times we visited and hope to make our way back, from Australia to Italy,  and visit again one day.

Having said that, I read, with interest some of the negative reviews on this forum. While I am at a loss to understand them, I accept everyone is entitled to their opinion. I suppose the reader of any review needs to discern the agenda and values of the reviewer and question whether they align with their own. Similarly, not all of us appreciate the same dining experience, hence we owe it to ourselves to establish that the offering is to our taste and budget, regardless of its reputation, before we attend and, most certainly, before we publicly review our experience.  

It’s all too easy to be a keyboard warrior, not caring for the validity and fairness of our comments, or the deleterious effect they may have on peoples’ livelihoods and wellbeing. 

This restaurant is not a one man band, it is run by a dedicated team brought together under the leadership of renowned chef Massimo Bottura.  I quote from a menu explanation document provided on this visit: “Alone I am Massimo Bottura; with my team, we are Osteria Francescana.” 

Every minute we were there we could see fantastic attention to detail and amazing teamwork in action.  Of course, as diners, we only see the front of house team, but the impeccable quality of the  food indicated the back of house team was equally well organised. 

A visit to Osteria Francescana is not cheap, but it is great value for money! 

Do yourself a favour, if you enjoy high end, degustation dining experiences, book well in advance, and make the trip to Modena. You won’t be sorry.","2","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-01-03","2024-01-03","en","Osteria Francescana","1160010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r932170848-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html"

I came to Massimo restaurant right before Netflix hit.
A totally different place and experience.
Took me 3 years to bring my parents to the restaurant  to celebrate their 40th anniversary and let me tell you what a disappointment I walked my self in too.

Very Disappointment and kindly frustrated for what we experience, in a place like this I don’t expect, I require the best of everything, that’s why we have place like this and that’s why we go. 

First in line to walk in the door at 12:30 and the smell of humidity (wet carpet right of the bet) made my parents saying 2023 and they use carpet? What a shame. 
Sit down and no welcoming drinks, a place where you pay 325 euro for the experience doesn’t bring a welcome drinks to guest is seriously a joke 
My family didn’t want to have the full menu and they pretty much force the whole table to chose between tasting menu or a la carte to avoid delays or issues when the place are coming out. With all the respect I have for the food, the art and experience but is not my problem. I am here to pay for what ever is available is your job to figure it out how to serve 2 tasting menu and 2 a la carte dish.
Hate at Duomo and enoteca pinchiorri this year and I didn’t have any issue in ordering different menus for the table.
Spent 1650 euro in wine, 2015 and 2018 sassicaia 1 ripasso e 2 primitivo, I had to call the waitres 3 times to fill my father glass of wine, no attention to detail from the staff.
Staff is young and I love the fact is using the new generations but train them well before throw them in to the ring.
The room is dark and depressing, crazy woman painting are in the wall without sense 
Food was good but not stellar, at least not now.
Half of the real menu is gone and is new creations with hints of Modena. I didn’t came to eat mini carbonara  I came to eat what Massimo used to serve.
After paying the bill and bought 4 bottle of balsamic v. To take home, my dad kindly ask one of the staff if a grappa or an after drinks was offered saying in veneto dialect 
My son just spent 3500 euro for food and wine can we get a grappa for free smiling? 
The staff looked at both of us and said, sorry we don’t know and walked away.

Go to villa crispi, il duomo oppure enoteca pinchiorri if you are truly want a 3 star Michelin experience, here not sure what you can get.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/0d/6e/82/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 1","Truly Disappointing","We came here last summer and honestly put off writing this review for so long because we didn't want to admit how bad it was... we were SO excited to come here and it was SUCH a huge disappointment. They had a new menu that replaced the revered classics that had been made famous by their extensive media presence. The culinary detour felt less of an evolution and more of a disservice to the legacy of the restaurant. The phrase ""that's interesting"" quickly became a commonplace across the pin-drop quiet dining room as folks said it to cover the disappointment we felt with each course. The dishes seemed to chase innovation at the expense of enjoyment. 

The '5 Stages of Parmesan' (from the old menu - had to order it in addition to the tasting menu) was the only thing that gave us the excellence we anticipated.  The risotto was the other stand out from the day but beyond that, we really didn't like very much... We were extremely disappointed by the “porchetta” that was actually fish, and the “bisteca Fiorentina” that was cabbage. Not only were these items not what we expected but the execution was lackluster and the illusion did not hold up. The dessert ‘oops I forgot the Caprese' felt like a complete fumble rather than a delightful surprise, a sentiment echoed by others in the dining room many of whom took a single bite and left the rest. The service mirrored the cold experimental vibe of the menu and atmosphere. The robotic delivery of the waitstaff matched the impersonal atmosphere, devoid of the warmth and charm one would expect at such a revered place. In talking with other diners after dinner we were reassured to learn we weren’t the only ones disappointed. We left Osteria Francescana with a sense of unfulfillment, a dissonance between the restaurant's storied reputation and the reality we experienced. We have enjoyed fine dining restaurants and tasting menus in several countries, all of which we enjoyed far more than this. Overall, a waste of time and money.

Atmosphere: 1","WHEN EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDS REALITY!","An ancient and wise aphorism prays: "" Create fame and then lay down to sleep""... It was an experience we both looked for, longed for, and idealized based on the Netflix series Chefs Table.
To begin it is a paradox that Chef Maximo's love of music will be ubiquitously absent in his restaurant and, instead, you get an almost unperceivable sound of ""elevator music""; then there is the ambiance, the restaurant feels like a dressed-up cave of monochromatic depressing colors wich mechanical like waiters are following a script in a staged scene in a cult-like role-playing scene. And then there is the protagonist: the food... So many expectations to be punched in the face with the reality of the overwhelming power of marketing and the contrast with real life. The problem with sophisticated cooking is the same as in art: sometimes convoluted and complex images are portrayed as profound and abstract and those who claim to really ""apprehend"" them know something that is revealed to them but denied to most. No, good food is real, is passionate it should not be interpreted, it shall remind us of our own human experience,  it should excite our senses, and remind us of the metaphysical dimension that embodies human experience itself: the divine.
The menu was pretentious, dull, and inconsistent. The service was mechanical as if the waiters were androids, not a warm, personal exchange. At the risk of sounding arrogant, we have eaten in quite a few Michelin-star restaurants and this was our only disappointment.","2","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2023-12-06","2023-12-06","en","Osteria Francescana","1160010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r928579608-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html"

Atmosphere: 1","Dashed Dreams","Where to even begin, especially after thinking long and hard about saying anything. I kept telling myself to just keep quiet, let it go…but then I think about others who might find themself feeling like I did after this experience— sad, let down, disappointed, and ripped off. I rarely write a bad or negative review because I know what it takes to operate a restaurant. I was a food critic in Kansas City for 6 years, I’ve written a cookbook, have a food blog, create recipes for an Italian wine club, and MOST of ALL— Massimo is a hero of mine. A food rock star. A giant, gifted chef and innovator. But, unfortunately, no longer in this spot.

My son flew from Taipei to Italy to share his 35 th birthday dining here. A dream of his, as he is a true foodie, having spent 3 years perfecting the worlds best  hamburger. Every year we celebrate his birthday by going big, and this year it was dinner for three of us here. The night before, we stayed in Bologna and ate at da Cesare, and enjoyed a meal like no other— honest Italian food at its best, served by the grandson of the restaurant’s founder, with a room filled  with love, joy, and deliciousness. Such a contrast to this experience in a sterile, quiet, somber room in which everyone felt a mixture of intimidation, loneliness, and expectation. The wait staff seemed aware that the food they were serving was beautiful to look at yet lacked all soul, love, and yumminess. One course— the main course— was pigeon breast. My son’s was okay, my friend’s was near- raw and inedible. Not one dish “ sung” in our mouth or imagination. Two of the courses were basically inedible. At one point, my son turned to me and whispered, “ Can we just leave?”

Why? Why has what should have been the meal of a lifetime ended up being souless? Is Massimo so distracted creating soup kitchens  and a restaurant empire that he feels those who can afford a $1,000 a person for dinner should be ridiculed by being served food lacking flavor, taste, joy, and — the most important ingredient of all— love? When we stood up from the table 4 hours later, even with Massimo visiting with us and being kind to us, we just felt relief that the meal was finally over and we could gracefully leave. He is a wonderful person, but right now the food he is serving here is unworthy of him. It is not art. It is not delicious. It may be innovative but it is not cutting edge enough to overcome the flaw of not tasting good. So, I have recorded our disappointment. At the end of the day, it is just a meal, but boy, did we have expectations which is maybe why we were so let down. The problem with being rated #1 is having to live up to it. Better to be da Cesare in Bologna and make people happy.

We were absolutely gutted. We came here a few years ago and had the best meal ever. Both of us are real foodies and I work in hospitality so we love spoiling ourselves and enjoying great food experiences. What a disappointment to come back and for the food to be so different. It’s great to see evolvement, but honestly this can’t be the same approach we enjoyed previously. The food made no sense and the ingredients didn’t work. The food ‘stories’ didn’t seem genuine and not one dish stood out. When we came last time we couldn’t stop talking about every dish, this time, we were just gobsmacked and travelled home in silence. It might have been our imagination but the staff almost seemed apologetic every time they placed a plate in front of us. I felt ill by the time I got home as nothing combined well and the flavours were bizarre. The service was okay but this is definitely not the place I told so many people about and sadly we will never be back. We travelled a long way to experience this again, so just feel we should have checked the reviews again before committing.","3","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-23","2023-10-23","en","Osteria Francescana","1160010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r922605233-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html"

It was sparkling under the lights and absolutely delicious. Every course was immaculate, sometimes with flavor combinations that I've never seen before. The cherry-on-top was when Chef Bottura came out to talk with EVERY table.

Much like a grand prix race car, no matter how beautiful it looks or powerful the engine is, if its missing a wheel the car is not going to do well. All the great effort in planning, design and presentation are derailed.

The breakdown from good to worse.
The presentation was stellar. This is food art on display and worth seeing and is served very professionally with a staff that could not have been nicer, more helpful, anticipatory to guest needs. Bravo! Massimo has them well trained. And the sommelier could describe in detail every bottle of wine he served as well as the creative story behind each dish.
Of the dishes served the ones that impressed us most were:
  The lamb (unique flavor and complex), pasta al pesto served layered in glass dish, veal was excellent quality,  perfectly cooked and paired with several different colored food sauces on the plate (and the best of the food art display), the 3-risotto’s,  and  “Oops I dropped the lemon tart”. 
Less appreciated was the filling in tortellini: average. Had better tortellini in Bologna. Slightly disappointing was the lasagna. The goal was to taste like crispy ends of a lasagna dish but this didn’t happen, let alone it mediocre taste. And finally the 5-versions of parmigiana :Too much cheese! (This alone with maybe some pistachio nuts would have been good for the whole dinner. Beautiful concept but cheese over cheese ad nauseum was overkill.)

Poor outcome was the veal Picasso-design food art presentation: it turned into a gooey quagmire halfway thru eating it  as the sauces blended together. The unique flavors were lost.  Beautiful design but poor in practicality.

Overall the courses were rich foods much like having 9 courses of pate.  The heavy cheese sauces on several dish after another, without an intervening break, was too much for the palette to take. 

The dinning room itself was beautifully laid out but the acoustics were terrible. Sounds bounced off the walls competing with each other so it was hard to hear a person directly across from you. Very straining on the body as the course of the meal was several hours.

The greatest disappointment was the Red wine issue(s). Only one wine was red; a $35.00! Sangiovese. Slated to be paired with the veal, the wine was NOT at room temperature but chilled (one guest at our table likes it chilled), thus hardly much flavor. And when it approached near room temperature, the flavor of this non decanted wine did not pair with the veal at all. 
  There was a single decanter of red wine, which was grabbed by a patron at another table (he did not wait to be served as was custom). I asked for more red wine and the sommelier poured from another chilled bottle. I asked him about decanted wine or at least room temperature and he had no answer. He did ramble on and on about something but  clearly avoided this issue.

The breakdown from good to worse.
5-star: presentation of each dish. This is food art on display and worth seeing.
-The staff could not have been nicer, more helpful, anticipatory to guest needs as well as presenting the dishes. Bravo! Massimo has them well trained.
-The sommelier wine knowledge of each bottle, his description of each dish.
-Of the dishes served the best ones were 
  -The lamb ( unique flavor and complex), -pasta al pesto served layered in glass dish.   -Best of all was the veal. Perfectly cooked, paired with several different colored food sauces on the plate and the best of the food art display. -3-risotto’s,  and -oops I dropped the lemon tart were also very good

4- star:too many dishes of rich food much like having 9 courses of pate.
  -Tiramizuca was good.

3-star: poor acoustics caused competing sounds so it was hard to hear a person across from you. Very straining on the body as the course of the meal was several hours.
-The heavy cheese sauces on one dish after another without an intervening break was too much on the palette to take. 
-Stuffing in tortellini in the end of the night surprised dish. It was average.
-breakdown of the veal dish; half way through  it all the sauces blended into one gooey mess. Thus, a presentation with poor practicality.

2- star; 
-lasagna dish. The goal was to taste like crispy ends of a lasagna dish but this didn’t happen. Next time try making several small dishes of lasagna and serve the crispy ends only 
-5 versions of parmigiana :Too much, this alone with maybe some pistachio nuts would have been good for the whole dinner 
-Sommelier handling of the one and only decanter of red wine. A patron grabbed this decanter and poured it all out to those at his table. The sommelier talked to him but otherwise nothing else. This was notable for the red wine, see 1-star note below 

1-star: Sangiovese (only red wine of the night)was Not prepared to be served!
It was chilled (way below room temp, most likely 60 degrees) thus the wine flavor/taste had not opened up. Knowing he would be serving Sangiovese why wasn’t this issue addressed? As well, he served it right out of the chilled bottle: it was NOT decanted.  
-So the  issue of the only decanter of red wine; what was the sommelier thinking/doing?   I asked him precisely on this point. His reply was weak and really did nit address my question. Grrrrr!
-Lastly, the red wine paired poorly with r the fabulous meat once it opened up. I can’t believe how poorly paired this was.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/6f/c5/a7/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 2","Very disappointing visit! ","I'll preface this review by saying I've wanted to go to Francescana for 10 years. Seeing Massimo Bottura on various TV shows, I was drawn in by his passion for Italian cooking, getting the best of regional ingredients, and being bold enough to present Italian cooking in a very contemporary way. As such, securing a reservation was something I never thought I'd do, so my excitement levels were high. I was fortunate enough to experience a 3* experience in February this year in the UK, and couldn't wait to see how the Italians did it. 

The restaurant is set in a cobbled street in Modena, and as you walk in you are greeted by a corridor of contemporary art, and 3-4 FOH staff. We were seated in a small room (one of three, I think?), with 2 other couples, resulting in a quiet atmosphere. As we were introduced to the menu, the waiter gave us a small booklet contextualising the menu, and began (in Italian) to explain it. As an English person, my Italian partner stopped him to say I didn't speak Italian, to which the waiter gracefully switched out the booklets for English ones and without skipping a beat recommenced the context in English. Very smooth service, and it was a really good start. 

For a tasting menu positioned as ""evolutions of classic Bottura dishes"", very few dishes felt elevated or exceptional. The three amuse bouches, with herbal broth, were forgettable, and followed by ""a potato wanting to be a truffle"" - nice enough piece of bread filled with a potato puree and it evoked the earthiness of the ingredients well, but nothing groundbreaking. If the dish set out to taste like a potato, it succeeded, but we never felt like we'd want more. The ""mullet and scampi"" dish was very fresh tasting, with lots of flavored foam on top of a chawanmushi base. The ""trout"" dish was my first highlight; blackened fish skin (in the shape of a fish) showed real care and attention, with really well-cooked fish, good saltiness and sauce. ""grey and black"" also was strong, and set out to invoke the tastes of the sea using cuttlefish and caviar. It did so very well, presentation was also very strong, with a cuttlefish mousse spelling out ""grigio"". 

The ""caesar salad that wants to be a pasta"" was very disappointing; it was presented cold (surely this was intentional?). It tasted like a caesar salad but, from a creativity point of view, not sure the reasoning behind the dish at all, so it was difficult to ground myself in what it was trying to achieve. Presentation was poor, and the sauce didn't look particularly glamorous either. The same could be said of the ""tortellini or dumpling"", with quite a bland broth that didn't pack much punch. ""la vie en rose"" was presented as the 'main dish' of the tasting menu, and was a cut of venison in various sauces. Presentation was incredible, tasted great, and was a highlight. Oddly, the dish was served with a ""scarpetta"", a reference to a common Italian practice of mopping up pasta sauce with your bread. The bread was served 20 minutes before the dish came out, so it suffered by just being sat there on the table exposed to the air, and even then, wasn't mindblowing to taste, and was nowhere near enough sauce to justify it being there. ""this piggy went to market"" was the 'pre-desert', and was a traditional biscuit and chocolate dessert, shaped like a pig, and then served with a chocolate and liver sauce. There was a rationale to the presence of the liver as a homage to on a traditional blood sauce (sanguinaccio), it had potential to be delicious but the liver really didn't help the taste and it held the overall dish back. 

The milk dish was the first dessert proper, and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Textures and the sauces were incredible, presented beautifully with a spritz of ""wild grass"" scent before you ate. Really superb stuff. I also really enjoyed ""bread is gold"", a combination of creams, bread sauces and flavours of panettone. It also contained some ""cotechino"", a traditional pork sausage dish served at Christmas-time. This was a direct replacement for the candied fruit in a panettone, which for me, worked (but was it necessary?). My partner felt it completely ruined the dish (others in the room had a few bites and left the rest). Finally we had a trio of petit fours. A lovely caramel popcorn lollipop, a ""micro"" version of the classic ""oops I dropped the lemon tart"", which was absolutely sublime despite being a single bite, then a pastry / bread traditionally made with rum, but in this instance, made with tomato water as an alternative. I really didn't like the taste, and was jarred at going from one of the best bites of the evening to the worst in a few seconds. 

Service overall was very mixed despite the strong start. Introductions to the dishes seemed overly rehearsed and stilted, and I never got the feeling that the FOH staff really believed that they were serving food from one of the best restaurants in the world. I clumsily dropped one of the first dishes by the side of my plate, leaving some breadcrumbs. We overheard one of the more senior FOH staff advise a more junior member to clear it up, which didn't happen. That same junior member also came over to top up our water. My partner felt having the glass refilled every three sips was quite overbearing and interrupted the flow of the conversation way too often, especially in a small room. She decided to fill her own glass to avoid it being filled as often as it was happening. When eventually the water run out, the waiter came over and, realising the bottle was already empty, tutted and gestured to me, as if I'd caused a problem. He of course went to get a new bottle, but it was a very bizarre interaction and made us feel uncomfortable. Lastly, toward the end, other tables were asked how their meal was, given opportunity to share their favourite dishes and interact with the FOH staff. We weren't offered such an opportunity, just given the bill, which we paid. On the way out, one of the more engaging FOH staff did ask us, but it was another inconsistency I wasn't expecting. 

Personally, this level of attention to detail isn't something I lose sleep over, or feel compelled to call out in the moment. That said, I've been in other restaurants (some starred, others not), whereby a quick clear down of any crumbs or remnants happens between every course, and there's regular check-ins on how you found the dishes, often resulting in a personal conversation about each dish throughout the evening.  Others have Aset a standard of service that Francescana didn't meet, in my view.  I would be interested to see if the Michelin guides have a similar experience when reviewing their status this year. 

While having a handful of really strong dishes demonstrated the skill of the kitchen and the cooking, it also further exposed the lacklustre feeling I had with the remainder. It felt often that the dish was designed with the gimmick in mind, forgetting the importance of flavour and precision cooking at a 3* level. The menu felt preoccupied with trying to reinvent a load of classic dishes that didn't need reinventing. Ultimately if Massimo Bottura wants to challenge himself and his chefs and keep evolving and doing something differently, that's his prerogative to do so, and something you'd expect at this level. However, this menu didn't hit the mark at all and seemed focused purely on cheeky nods and winks to the dishes that put Francescana on the map, rather than keeping it on the map for the reason you're there: impeccable food.

Last time Massimo was cooking and here and greeting. This time, he was around but with reporters and had no interest to say hello even from a distance. The waiting staff were utterly miserable and seemed like students on their summer break helping out. They must be happy as I have seen them happy on instagram so why the grim faces. The tables ate set so that you awkwardly look at other guests/tables and the silence is bizarre. 
Down the road there is the most incredible restaurant where the staff and the chef are fabulous and Nonna actually comes out and greets people still, every night.. It is called Antica Moka so dont bother with here, instead have an utter blast for a fraction of the price and go there.

Atmosphere: 2","Huge Artistry in the Food. Vegetarian Available. Atmosphere Too Serious","It was a dream come true to visit Osteria Francescana after seeing it and Massimo Bottura highlighted in many food programs over the years. We scored a reservation the minute they opened up (and glad we did as a few minutes later, all of the reservations for this month were gone...and this was about 6 months in advance.) With such a sought after place, make sure you put a lot of advanced thought into coming here or you just won't get in.

Honestly it was the Five Ages of Parmesan Cheese dish that brought us here. We added that to the tasting menu (after mortgaging our house to be able to afford this meal) and it was for sure the highlight of our tasting experience.

We enjoyed many other things, especially the incredible amount of artistry that went into each dish and its presentation. We especially remember the beet dish. We're vegetarians so got a vegetarian version of the tasting menu and they did, we think, a pretty good job of matching up flavor profiles with the meat versions of the dishes they came with. We also thought the Eggplant all San Domenico was one of the best presentations, taste and texture of eggplant we've ever had.

The atmosphere was a little bit of a bummer...it was INCREDIBLY FORMAL AND SERIOUS to be in there. The staff in particular, I don't think ever smiled, and the overall ambiance was kind of heavy. I guess this makes sense for one of the most famous fine-dining restaurants in the world, but it didn't quite match the playfulness of Botturo's on-screen personality, or the same playfulness that went into the naming of the dishes.

And although we enjoyed everything, even a few weeks later with pictures of everything, it's hard to pull out highlights...maybe because the meal had so many courses...just thinking about it, it kind of all ran together...whereas at many other restaurants we dined at throughout Italy on this vacation, we can call out specific tastes flavors and joy at being in the places.

If we were to do it again we would just order a-la carte. The 5 Ages of Parmesan dish that brought us in wasn't included in the tasting menu and we would have been VERY happy with it and a couple other items and the food, likely would have been more memorable and we would have saved hundreds of dollars.

Massimo...you're a super-fun guy. Let that reflect in the experience one has in your most famous restaurant.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/ea/b2/cd/caption.jpg

It was my birthday present from my husband. It was a dream come true for me:) 
I had a tasting menu with 16 dishes and I enjoyed every one . The combination of ingredients was very well combined ( the basic ingredients like mint, parsley, basil… ). 
For ones in life worth every effort but not more !
I put some pictures with my face tasting menu and for wine that I discovered there which was really good!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/c6/71/4a/caption.jpg
