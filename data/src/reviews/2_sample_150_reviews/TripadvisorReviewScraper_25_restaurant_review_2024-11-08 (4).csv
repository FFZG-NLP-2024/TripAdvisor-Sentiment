We dined in  the Garden Room where we had a view of the gardens surrounding the site.  Their philosophy is  “from plant to plate.” All of the food is grown in their gardens in Amsterdam and the Beemster, and these are the heart and soul of the restaurant and menu. They
grow about 300 varieties of vegetables, herbs, and fruits in the gardens, both greenhouse and open air. Every course including the appetizers were wonderful.  This was out of this world and so very memorable.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-09-16","2024-09-16","en","De Kas","696917","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d696917-r970040230-De_Kas-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

still a nice place to eat in a lovely setting.
staff are nice and friendly and the food is very good.
the menu is built around what they have available at the time as the grow a lot of their own products.
On our 1st visit it was explained by the staff which part of the food was grown on the premises which we thought was interesting but it was missing on our 2nd visit.
Highly recommend and easily accessible by tram","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-15","2024-09-15","en","De Kas","696917","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d696917-r969801971-De_Kas-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

De Kas is in a lovely park just outside of the city center but in an interesting neighborhood nonetheless. They have two greenhouses wherein they grow all of their produce, one smaller one adjacent to the restaurant and another offsite. This was one of the original ""farm-to-table"" establishments and we have been coming here for 20 years. De Kas NEVER disappoints. Service, ambiance, and especially the quality of the food are all 100% spot on. Sourdough bread and tapioca bread wonderful starters. Fresh radishes and tempura asparagus were our amuse-bouches. This was followed by the brightest, freshest gaspacho ever. I mean ever. Haddock the next course-sublime. Interestingly ( and it worked ) white asparagus was our main. We understand why white asparagus is so celebrated in northern Europe in the spring. No room for dessert, but it looked over the top. I believe it was a pound cake with fresh berries. These nice people know what they are doing. Special mential to our server Sharon. Lovely in every way. Three weeks in Europe-including two in Italy- this was by far our best meal.","0","","FAMILY","2024-06-30","2024-06-16","2024-06-16","en","De Kas","696917","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d696917-r955313425-De_Kas-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

Their mantra is HARVESTED IN THE MORNING, ON YOUR PLATE IN THE AFTERNOON.
Every course was truly outstanding. Fresh, creative and delicious. The waitstaff was really helpful and knowledgeable. 

The vibe is very cool - a funky greenhouse setting. It’s a big wide open space so it is a little noisy during dinner conversation. Make sure you book well in advance.  Very special!

If there is one thing I’d request - is to have an explanation with what’s in each course while served. The server explains but it’s hard to remember as you’re enjoying each one.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-03","2024-05-03","en","De Kas","696917","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d696917-r949305580-De_Kas-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

Loved the place. The ambiance, surroundings and staff really come together very well. The food is superb both in its conception and its delivery. Fresh, vibrant and balanced.

Atmosphere: 5","Lovely special meal in a greenhouse atmosphere with great service. ","We made sure to book for dinner a few weeks ahead of our trip. We were sat down by a screaming toddler and asked to move which they kindly did and it was odd folks took little kids here due to the price point and it wasn't that early in the night when families with younger kids tend to go out. The whole area was staring at this table so it was not just us wondering why they didn't take steps to quiet or soothe their child. The couple next to where we were moved, came here once a year from far away for years and were very frustrated by it. Our meal was delicious and we had lovely wine along with it. My only quibble was perhaps it is cultural but the empty plates were left down a long time after we had finished. The place is massive and this could be due to being there on a Saturday night. The dish with truffle shavings was my favorite! Vegetables are the star here an the focus. There are meat and fish options but know you are going to have outstanding freshly grown vegetables prepared in inventive and delicious ways. We will be back if we are back in Amsterdam and if you can splurge this is worth it! ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/5c/10/76/caption.jpg
