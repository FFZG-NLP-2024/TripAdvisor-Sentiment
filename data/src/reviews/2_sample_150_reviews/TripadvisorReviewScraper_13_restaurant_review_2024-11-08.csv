The degustation menu highlights fresh ingredients, often from the farm associated with the hotel. The dishes have a crisp point of view and highlight the integrity of flavors and well-balanced ingredients. There is a solid selection of wines that complement the food. The dining room is grand without being stuffy. And the personnel are warm and welcoming. Looking forward to dining here again.

The dinner was definitely an experience and worth trying if you have the time and interested in the menu. The entire meal lasted around 2.5 hours. The food was exceptional! We opted for the 6-course tasting menu and left stuffed.

Atmosphere: 5","Okay but not great.","I also included a bit of our experience in the hotel review I wrote.  I have to say that we felt this restaurant wasn't that great. I also found that the restaurant staff were not keen to provide a great experience. Our best experiences were with the most junior staff, while the senior staff were some of our worst experiences. That being said, we never really judge a restaurant by the service, and the food is most important to us.  

The food was not great. It's always subjective, but for the price, we really felt underwhelmed. The first course (Tomato) was our favourite, and if the rest of the meal had been as inventive and interesting, we would have a different review.  We also felt a bigger focus on veggies would have paired better with their branding around using the hotel grounds to grow local produce. Unfortunately, the remaining courses didn't impress. The trout course was okay, but foam has been over-done and didn't really add much in terms of depth. The abalone course was absolutely terrible; they were unable to tenderize the meat as needed, and the texture was a very very tough rubber. Our knives struggled to cut it. The duck course was gamey and tough as well.  The lobster course was okay. We had to leave before dessert (we had tickets to show) but we felt pretty confident we were not missing out on much.

Again, food is always subjective, and we are not professional critics.  The older couple next to us felt the food was very good. That being said, we have eaten at some amazing restaurants during our travels, and this felt a bit overpriced and uninspired.  We got the sense that this restaurant may be past it's prime, and needs some new management.","0","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-17","2023-10-17","en","Bellefeuille","1096668","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r921746454-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Food: 2","Disappointing - and they try to take my review down","I wrote a very lengthy review to explain why the meal was very disappointing, bar maybe two dishes (the celeriac / truffle pasta and the dessert). They requested TA to take it down (don't like criticism?). But people should know this restaurant is in fact quite disappointing:
1) the chefs seems to care more about how nice the dishes look and how many different flavours he can cram, rather than actual test.
2) we were overcharged for a bottle of wine rather than a glass - this was corrected after we noticed but not even an apology.
3) after dinner we were completely neglected, couldn't even get a cab for us.

Paris has so much better to offer, even at this price point. Do not bother here.","3","","COUPLES","2022-12-31","2023-03-21","2023-03-21","en","Bellefeuille","1096668","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r883004766-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 5","A haven of peace in Paris and 1 Michelin star","The Bellefeuille undoubtedly deserves its Michelin star. In an exquisite setting deliberately a little outdated with, on the edge of the restaurant, its English bar and its magnificent library, the Bellefeuille (place Adenaeur near the Porte Dauphine in Paris) also benefits from the ""protected"" environment of the Saint James with its garden that makes it a haven of peace. The cuisine is refined and if you want to make a meal off the beaten track you will not be disappointed. It will also allow you access for an evening to the very closed Saint James Club which otherwise is only accessible to club members or guests of the 5 star hotel it houses.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-06-23","2024-06-23","en","Bellefeuille","1096668","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r956377057-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 5","A very large table in a case.","Everything has already been written about the enchanting setting of the Hôtel Saint James, its bar and its restaurant, Le Bellefeuille, completely renovated recently. Not only are we outside of time, but also elsewhere.
After the essential aperitif at the bar, let's sit down with the 8-course menu without counting the appetizers: three wonderful little bites that open the door to an exceptional gastronomic moment.
It must be said that the restaurant has its own vegetable garden, in Nonville, which guarantees freshness, variety and quality of the vegetables served.
The starter, a lightly smoked beet generously accompanied by small but powerful caviar, an unexpected “earth, air, sea” marriage of perfect balance, precedes an original composition of various mushrooms.
The arctic char that follows is a marvel of delicacy, with a juice developing discreet aromas of almond and plum. Thanks to precise cooking of the section, it melts in the mouth and floats away like a caress. This is one of the few best dishes I have tasted in a restaurant.
The lobster, always cooked to perfection, is enhanced with a slightly spicy sauce.
Another classic dish: the beautiful mullet fillet with its golden, crispy skin which echoes the maritime power of the mullet flesh.
Follows the unexpected squid, also melting, a dish treated in an original way with its reworked ink.
Last course: tasty hen emboldened, discreetly, with a Chartreuse juice.
Two pretty pre-desserts precede the magnificent chocolate and lichen pod, delicious, original, again a unique piece.
The service is as I like: professional, communicative, smiling, precise, knowing perfectly the details of the dishes that are served.
To complete this exceptional moment, the correct advice from the sommelier is a Chenin Huis Clos 2019, delicious which “resonates” with all the dishes.
I was seduced by the clean, generous, original cuisine of Julien Dumas, whose abundant creativity and assertive personality can be felt. At Bellefeuille, it is not gastronomy that serves sensations, but, on the contrary, it is sensations that serve gastronomy. The promotion of noble products is always measured with precision, executed with safety and originality, without eccentricity, presented with elegance. On large menus, it is not uncommon to find useless ""mouth-hole"" dishes to extend the number of courses, or modest products (sardines, hake, etc.) vainly ""sacralized"", or even portions at medical minimalism, here, it's quite the opposite, we are facing a cuisine that is both artistic, which involves creativity and talent, and passion, which involves sincerity and generosity, gastronomy as I loves him.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2024-01-11","2024-01-11","en","Bellefeuille","1096668","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r933690113-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

As for the food, we were directly immersed in the Gulf of Morbihan, with a few visits elsewhere in France, notably in Auvergne. All the fish were perfectly cooked and sublimated.
