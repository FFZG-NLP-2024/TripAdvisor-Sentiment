My husband and I enjoyed it and were glad we went, but we won't be going back and we won't be recommending it either.

The service was just OK (Nick was great) but the $600 bill (without any of the liquor pairings) for 2 was more than we thought was justified. They did mention three times while introducing courses that this was a ""Fine Dining"" experience - that struck me as strange. I suppose since little old Denver only has three one-star restaurants we don't recognize a fine dining establishment.

Last comment - both the men's and women's bathrooms had a horrendous sewage odor. One worker chalked it up to the fact that the restrooms are in the basement of an old building. Regardless, it's rough to experience a raw sewage smell in the middle of a ""Fine Dining"" experience. So, if you go, try not to use the bathrooms!!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-09","2024-09-09","en","Bruto","21502908","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d21502908-r969072589-Bruto-Denver_Colorado.html"

However, this is a really fantastic place deserving of the plaudits and maintains the attention to detail required and creative pairing of flavours both in the food and drink options. Excellent stuff. 

Some of the combinations were truly breathtaking and aside from the incongruous music choices, this was a treat of the highest order.","0","","SOLO","2024-05-31","2024-05-17","2024-05-16","en","Bruto","21502908","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d21502908-r951156515-Bruto-Denver_Colorado.html"

Food was good but certainly not outstanding. Never provide bread with a super spicy paste at the beginning of a meal, will ruin the taste buds for the next hour. Wine pairing was poor, some mediocre wines that did not fit with the food. Reception non existing, had to wait in a hallway for a while before I got seated despite a reservation. I am a big fan of Michelin stared restaurants, but I have no idea why Michelin gave this place a star. Not worth it.","0","","SOLO","2023-12-31","2024-05-07","2024-05-07","en","Bruto","21502908","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d21502908-r949889782-Bruto-Denver_Colorado.html"

We thoroughly enjoyed the chef’s table dining experience. The ambiance was very nice. Small and intimate setting with just 16-18 guests.  Our server Raymond, was great. He kept us informed of the preparation of each course. I chose to do the wine pairing so he also explained the story behind each wine, making the experience even more interesting.  The courses were spaced out nicely and it was entertaining to watch the magic in the kitchen as each chef worked their station. It was like watching a beautifully orchestrated dance. The presentation was truly beautiful. Very artistic and a nice balance of different flavors. Highly recommend it for a special occasion.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/ef/de/a6/caption.jpg

Deserving of Michelin consideration","Absolutely fantastic dining experience. 6 course tasting menu with options for oysters and caviar.  Intimate counter experience as you watch your dinner prepared.  Kitchen is open and chefs interact with you, answering your questions as they dazzle you with their creativity. Wine or cocktail pairings. I told chef Michael that I was very sad that it would be so much harder to get a reservation here on our yearly trip to Denver when the rest of the world found out how excellent this experience was.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/6d/52/18/bruto.jpg

Food: 5","We highly recommend this restaurant","We had a wonderful, inventive 5-course meal with great service. The space is pleasing and we waited until we could have seats with backs so we’d be more comfortable. Chef-Owner Michael DeLeon Diaz is very talented as well as personable. It was fun to sit and watch all the activity in the kitchen. We started with the house signature bread called piada made in the oven that was blazing, and inviting, when we walked in. As with all of the dishes in the chef’s choice menu, it was delicious and unusual. The staff was professional, well-informed and delightful too. We started with the really great spring tortilla. The dishes that followed included a wonderful fish dish, a pasta that was excellent, a bison dish and then dessert. Rather than detailing the exquisite tastes, we just encourage you to get a reservation! We spent about $250 without alcohol (there is a non-alcoholic pairing option that we didn’t have). We will be back; the menu changes with the season.","0","","NONE","2022-05-31","2022-05-09","2022-05-09","en","Bruto","21502908","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d21502908-r837888061-Bruto-Denver_Colorado.html"
