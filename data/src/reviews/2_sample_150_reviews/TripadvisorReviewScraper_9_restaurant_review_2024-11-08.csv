Food: 5","Here is cooking a successful experiment","In the class room of this old school you will indeed learn something you hardly will forget. Namely, how a group of young and highly talented cooks with their staff reinterpret food. We spent a fantastic evening here and most appreciated that every question we had was promptly answered giving you every detail how the jewels which come out of the kitchen were delicately prepared. In Italy, you would call such a lace a ""laboratorio"". And a first class laboratory this is, indeed. Unforgettable. And very unexpected to be found in a somewhat lost part in the North-East of Germany.","0","","NONE","2019-07-31","2019-08-05","2019-08-05","en","Restaurant Alte Schule Fürstenhagen","2444501","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g651880-d2444501-r695789278-Restaurant_Alte_Schule_Furstenhagen-Feldberger_Seenlandschaft_Mecklenburg_West_P.html"

We stayed for two nights. The first evening we had the standard menu and the second we had the 5 course menu. The food was well presented and good quality with some interesting and attractive ideas. The building is simply refurbished with nice decorative items in tune with the school theme. Our accommodation was on two levels with the sleeping area up a steep staircase. It was simply furnished. Overall it was an enjoyable stay but I think that the charges are a bit expensive for what it was. It is unsatisfactory at a place like this to have trolleys with dirty linen and other cleaning material left at the bottom of the stairs to guest rooms for almost 24 hours. It was really distasteful and shows poor attention to detail.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/46/87/dd/guest-room.jpg

On the second evening we were in the restaurant Alte Schule. Here we were more than very satisfied. An exceptionally perfectly combined menu of regional products prepared with the highest craftsmanship and presented perfectly. There to an exciting and suitable wine accompaniment and all at a very fair price/performance ratio. In addition, the Old School is located in a wonderful environment. We will definitely come back!","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-19","2024-08-19","en","Restaurant Alte Schule Fürstenhagen","2444501","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g651880-d2444501-r965643867-Restaurant_Alte_Schule_Furstenhagen-Feldberger_Seenlandschaft_Mecklenburg_West_P.html"

The rooms are not overly comfortable, but they are nicely furnished and the name is reminiscent of the school's history, including one or two memorabilia.
Lovingly.
In the evening we met for dinner in the winter garden.
What was presented exceeded all expectations, both in terms of the quality of the food and the service.
Several greetings from the kitchen were followed by the five courses of the menu.
Every course impressed with its taste and appearance, excellent. And here, in the middle of nowhere (sorry).
With enjoyment. The delicious bread that is served at the beginning should be used sparingly, otherwise the saturation point will be reached too early.
Overall a great evening, many thanks to the entire team.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-30","2024-03-30","en","Restaurant Alte Schule Fürstenhagen","2444501","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g651880-d2444501-r944476962-Restaurant_Alte_Schule_Furstenhagen-Feldberger_Seenlandschaft_Mecklenburg_West_P.html"

Fantastic!
A historic building complex worth seeing and super friendly hosts. We were welcomed from the first minute.
The surprise menu was really a surprise. Each course was a taste bomb.
Culinary art of an extremely high standard. Many thanks to Daniel Schmidthaler and his brilliant team.
Super friendly presentation. Very attentive service. We had a lot of fun together.
The accompanying wines were poured and introduced by the ""boss"". Unexpected and perfect with the courses. Excellent!
We would love to come back. The trip to the Feldberg Lake District is definitely worth it!","0","","COUPLES","2023-11-30","2023-11-26","2023-11-26","en","Restaurant Alte Schule Fürstenhagen","2444501","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g651880-d2444501-r927482716-Restaurant_Alte_Schule_Furstenhagen-Feldberger_Seenlandschaft_Mecklenburg_West_P.html"

We booked the maisonette room and spent two fantastic evenings in the Klassenzimmer restaurant.
On the first evening we were treated to a wonderful 7-course menu, cleverly prepared, beautifully presented and served.
The second evening with the vegetarian option was also an absolutely tasty experience with extraordinary combinations of various regional ingredients.
The delicious breakfast and the very friendly service rounded off our stay.
You will be enchanted here!
