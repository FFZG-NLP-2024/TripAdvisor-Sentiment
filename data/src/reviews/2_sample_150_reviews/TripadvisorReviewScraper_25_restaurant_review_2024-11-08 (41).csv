While the service was friendly and professional, the dishes, though artfully presented, fell short in flavor and left me underwhelmed given the steep prices. I do not want to be served veal brain or other odd ingredients that don’t appeal to my taste. The main problem was that It was lacking so many “wow” dishes in order to be ranked as number three in world.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f8/5d/84/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r978300914-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

We were lucky enough to sit at the counter facing the kitchen so we could see all the preparation‘s in real time and we could even be served directly by one of the cooks.

This restaurant is a gutsy move by someone who used to be a food critic, Bruno Verjus. It is Carraige us to open a haute cuisine place and subject yourself to other critics.

Generally, I would say that he has succeeded : the dishes are creative and well prepared, and the service is impeccable.

Bruno Bruno himself, greets guests upon arrival and loves to chat with everyone which gives it a nice atmosphere and friendly touch.

However, there are still a couple of areas for improvement. For example, his lentil risotto was slightly disappointing because you could not taste the essence of the lentils. Instead, it is compensated with other flavors and that’s a shame for anyone who wants to put the product first. Also, in our tasting menu, there was a tendency to undercook the food or even serve it raw and then compensate with some other flavoring, which is a shame because you don’t get the full essence of some of the fish or seafood.

Final comment is about the prices which are absurdly high. This means of course you can’t come here for tasting menu on a regular basis and you even have to think twice for any meal at Table.

Still an interesting culinary experience.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/76/b4/2b/caption.jpg

Food: 5","A Tour de Force - One of Finest Dining Experiences in the World","Bruno, in my opinion, is one of the most inspired chefs in the world - and his restaurant, despite having received two Michelin stars, is vastly under appreciated.  Table should be mentioned alongside the well-known great restaurants in France. 

Table provides TRULY CREATIVE food that also manages to be delicious. Chef Bruno plays with flavors and concepts in a way that brings the patron to the origin of each ingredient.  Words do not do this place, or this man, justice.  The food needs to be experienced.  

The setting is a small bar-like environment, which still provides privacy between dining groups, due to clever architectural design.  An open kitchen is where the feast occurs for the eyes: a laboratory, an operating room, an orchestra.  

The knowledgeable and engaging staff round out the experience, each with a distinct and welcome persona.  Poetic descriptions of each dish, and thoughtful wine pairings throughout. 

And, all along, Chef is omnipresent. Overseeing his exemplary team, while he mingles with diners, popping back behind the bar occasionally to participate in the action. His bigger than life personality is felt in every moment of this epic experience. 

There may be some reviewers who have been less generous in their praise than this one.  Maybe the price, or fish-heavy menu, or tasting menu is unappealing for some.  To me, however, Table is the perfect meal. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/ff/8d/bb/caption.jpg

Service: 4
Food: 4","Restaurant Table","How to properly describe Table, an over-the-top experience with an over-the-top check (without wine, 400€/person)? 

It is small (fewer than 40 seats), casual (ties, even jackets, would be out of place), out of the way in the 12th, even informal in the sense the lucky half or so guests sit on a serpentine bar surrounding a completely open kitchen manned by four very busy cooks and overseen by the voluble, extroverted, supposedly self-taught grey haired chef, Bruno Verjus.  Sometimes cooking, sometimes sitting with or mingling with guests, sometimes cooking over the shoulders of his young chefs.  From the clients’ view, all is integrated through the most caring, intelligent, articulate service staff I have ever encountered in a Paris restaurant.  They explain and interpret in the most effective and collegial way.  It is truly a smooth functioning luxury machine, with none of the bowing and scraping ballet of a more conventional two- or three-star restaurant.  

The menu was almost entirely seafood, a subtle, maybe only seasonal, change from previous visits, more use of luxury ingredients; giant scallops, crab wrapped in chard, caviar (served with chocolate tarte and with thin sliced bass).  

The taster and preparations, especially the extensive use of fresh herbs and the sourcing of every dish shows careful thinking and immense preparation.  The cooks are busy and focused, but most of the work has taken place prior to service.  

Too many dishes to recall; salad, raw shrimp, urchin, crab, lobster, sweetbreads, sea bass, beet soup, roasted onion, etc., each served elegantly, but without pretense.

Leave wine choices to the young sommelier - she will bring glass after glass of unusual choices. 

Not for everyone, but a noticeable step up thanks to Table receiving a second Michelin Star last year.  Every seat taken.","0","","NONE","2022-10-31","2023-01-23","2023-01-23","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r876116587-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

This was my ninth visit to Paris so I wanted to try some new restaurants. Fortunately my luck dramatically improved with my final dinner in Paris at Michelin 2 star Table - Bruno Verjus! The cuisine, hospitality and service were marvelous! We chose the Tasting Menu and it was the perfect amount of food. Every course was delicious! There was no problem requesting changes to the menu for dietary restrictions and food dislikes.

Already the decoration and set up does not match the expectations of a 400€ fixed menu! 
The staff is “friendly” not high end enough, yet the whole image and quality of the place is not on point.
Simple set up for an ok restaurant is how I would define the place.
This is why they probably hold your credit card deposit of the whole amount of cancellations fees! 
In case you complain, they already got it!

Perhaps because of the location in the 12th, so off the beaten track, the staff so young and casual, the décor so informal and the chef playing host so enthusiastically to seats of regulars, that I didn’t adequately focus on how good it was.  

They urge you to order the tasting menu.  Wildly expensive (300€) (as are the a la carte options).  It is fabulous.  Seemingly, it will continue until you ask them to stop.  Wine pairings offered (and changed) by the glass.  Heavy use of luxury ingredients:  langoustines, prawns, caviar.  Small portions, but many of them.  Delicately sliced raw squid with caviar, vegetables, sweetbreads, raw sardines, steamed langoustine.  

The food was inventive, uncomplicated, prepared in front of you and served by cooks and waiters all of whom seemed to be having great fun.   

And, every one of the 30 or so seats taken.  We were two of four foreigners.  Not one looked like they were dressed for a 300€ menu.  All looked as if they had been there before.

This time the remarkably solicitous waiter suggested the multiple course tasting menu.  At 189€ a major investment, but with very high a la carte prices (maybe higher than the year before), a sensible suggestion.  

Extraordinary variety.  Modern, but not fussy dishes each totally original and cooked and plated directly in front of us, served by the chef or one of the three sous chefs.  Pea soup, barely cooked lobster, oyster with pork head cheese, griolles, turbot, goat, cheese, dessert.  Every dish carefully plated, deliciously sauced.  A memorable meal.","1","","NONE","2019-04-30","2019-09-20","2019-09-20","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r711481901-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

You pay ridiculous prices for very little preparation skills (eg. tomatoes salad 39 euros !). I remember the beginning of this restaurant trying to establish itself with a mix of inventive dishes (oseille desert) with traditional cooking (full grilled pintade) AND decent prices. It is all gone. Bye Bruno, so long, the restaurant is far from full at these prices. In the area, there is so much better for less euros.","5","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-09-19","2019-09-19","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r711117283-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Food: 2","Over-priced, under-taste, disappointing","This was my third visit to Table, and my last one I fear. Whilst the ingredients are of superlative quality, the food somewhat lacks flavour. Charging €89 for a relatively small piece of Turbot with hardly any sauce or spices is too much. 1-star rate Table charges 3-star prices but its bland food does not justify the price. Portions are small - that's not doubt why they stuff you with the good bread.","5","","COUPLES","2019-07-31","2019-07-23","2019-07-23","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r691974391-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

","Went to this place I really liked until today (7th time in 2 years...often with 6 or 7 guests). Took a friend who really likes good restaurants, just before a professional meeting, we were dressed very casual.  The server recommended the plat du jour : tuna ventresca with a couple vegetables, very light and delicate... without mentioning the price (other equivalent items on the menu were anywere from 30 to 50€... I just assumed the plat du jour was in the same range).
No entrée, no desert, we just had one small cheese plate to share ... and two expressos. We also asked for two glasses of dry chenin blanc. 
Bottom line: the food was excellent,as usual, but the bill came up to 245€!!!!!..... for a 1 course meal on a tuesday lunch... with tuna as « delicacy ».... this is totally absurd. Evenmore so that the chef actually did recognize me as a regular client.... 
I made a mistake in not asking the price of the tuna (70€ each... more expensive than lobster).... but another 100€ for one cheese plate, 2 glasses of wine and coffee! No way. This was the last time I set foot in this place. There are many good alternatives around.

Food: 4","Few tables at Table, expect to be seated at a counter, with strangers watching you eat","Our meal was very good, but not as extraordinary as the prices led us to expect. We started with the chanterelles sauvages, which were excellent, and the foie gras, which I thought excellent and my companion thought very good. For main courses, my companion ordered the pintade and received the thighs, legs, and wings. Another diner across from him received the supreme. At €49, my companion was a bit disappointed. I had the bar sauvage, also excellent with a perfect sauce made from oxalis(?). A bit more sauce would have been appreciated. The bottle wine list was daunting: unfamiliar varieties and labels, all at very high prices. I think it would have been better to order individual glasses based on what we ordered, as advised by the staff. We didn't know this option was available until after we had ordered a bottle. Instead of dessert we ordered the cheese platter and two glasses of red wine, which we enjoyed.","0","","COUPLES","2019-01-31","2019-01-14","2019-01-14","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r645761299-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Food: 5","Table","As the substance of this Diary should confirm, it is likely I am more familiar with Paris restaurants than many American visitors and probably many French.  So when a recommendation like Table comes along, a five year old Michelin one-star, that I have never even heard the name of, it surprises me.  It shouldn’t, there could be tens, maybe hundreds like it, although not likely as good.  More work to do!

Table is small, contemporary in feel in an unusual physical space.  A long, undulating counter running the full length of the space, with high top tables and a handful of conventional chairs and tables on the floor.  Everything is focused on the kitchen and chef and his three younger assistants who prepare and assemble all of the dishes from the short, but changing a la carte menu behind the counter (see L’Agrume, 5th).  Basically, sitting at the counter where most parties of two are seated, is eating in the kitchen.  The menu details the obsessive focus on artisanal sourcing.  We can attest to the bread; beautiful and delicious in a city replete with noteworthy bread.

All of this takes place in a perfectly safe-appearing, non-descript street in the slightly scruffy 12th, one block from the very busy (daytime only) Rue d’Aligre Market, the only open and covered market in Paris which on a daily basis combines food and flea market stalls.

FOOD
The concise a la carte menu is expensive.  A 39€ 3 course formula this is not.

Entrees of raw fish, girolles lightly cooked and served with an egg yolk to break into the sauce, raw sardines and tomatoes with burrata were each in the range of 25€.  We had the girolles, generous and delicious. 

The plats included sautéed monkfish or tuna, each carefully cut to order, pintade portioned from a very large semi-cooked bird and finished on the plancha, then sauced and plated with a boiled crayfish and served with a root vegetable “salad”, a small version of the vegetarian offering.  Also available was ¼ of a 3 pound Mediterranean lobster, split and grilled on the plancha (actually offered as an entrée) or sweetbreads sautéed in a half pound or so of butter.  (At 69€, they were going fast!)  Also on the entrée menu was sautéed frogs legs.

Being in the kitchen was an essential part of the experience, and an enjoyable one.

Desserts matched the food.  A version of ethereal chocolate mousse with ice cream, praline tart with sorrel ice cream, fresh strawberries with nuts, hot fresh cherries.  We never saw a wine list.  The glasses offered (16€) were varied and delicious, but judging from the wine on display, there is plenty to choose from.

SERVICE

A patient maître d’ explained each dish.  Kind servers delivered the food and wine.  Both exemplary, but the prime interaction was with the chefs, mostly watching.

PRICE

High, but worth the splurge.  All in with a total of 5 glasses of wine, 260€.","1","","COUPLES","2018-06-30","2018-11-05","2018-11-05","en","Restaurant Table","5594192","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r631074407-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

The chef (Bruno) is an Einstein of food. It’s hard to express in words about his food, it’s just like art, you have to try it yourself and interpret it yourself. He is not your typical Michelin Star chef that went to culinary school and got trained. He was a doctor, a business dealer, a journalist, a food blogger, an activist for fresh produce......who translated his passion and experiences into the food at Table. Even though being a Michelin Star chef, he is so humble, kind and funny. 
The staff is also very unique - they are young, talented, dynamic and take their jobs seriously with a smile on their face. I have never met any other restaurant staff elsewhere in Paris nor in other parts of the world, even with other Michelin Star places that have been so humble and inspiring as at the Table. They make you feel so at home.
Last but not least, they also carry some of the most unique drinks from different parts of the world. Their wines are all natural (bio) and the sommelier (Pierre), who specializes in bio wines would treat you to the finest selections. You cannot go wrong with anything he recommends. 
Best regards;
Vatsala
