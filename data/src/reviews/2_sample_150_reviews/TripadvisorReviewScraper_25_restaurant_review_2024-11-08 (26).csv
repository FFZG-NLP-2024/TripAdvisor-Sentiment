The food has made my imagination and my attention to translate visually every taste tasted flavor, but I did not understand why being careful not to waste and to enhance what the territory offers, were combined with French wines that in my opinion did not link with the flavors of local food. 
I did not like the shape on arrival, ""we invite you to the aperitif room waiting for the table"", we were poured 2 glasses of water NOT required, and after paying a very important bill, we were asked for an extra 15 euros for 2 glasses of water.","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Atelier Moessmer Norbert Niederkofler","26683048","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r976936414-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html"

The reception was appropriate for a top house and the start in the salon, with the amouse bouche, was also very successful.
Afterwards there was a guided tour of the restaurant and in addition to the dining facilities, reference was also made to the company Moessmer, which owns the Villa.
Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression.
The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table.
But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain.
Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures.
In the end, the long walk was absolutely worth it and even if the expectations were already very high, they were even topped a bit.
Many thanks to the entire team for a memorable evening.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/cd/31/0d/caption.jpg

The expectations for a 3 Michelin star are wow effect with every dish or as the Guide says “worth the trip”.  Definitely appreciable Cook the Mountain philosophy. There were highs (snails and Alpine grey meat) and some other dishes from which I would have expected more (risotto), a bit anonymous (salad). A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing. Considering the important price of the menu not appreciated the proposal of historical dishes off the list with additional cost to add. Wide proposal on champagne, limited on Italian sparkling wines, mark-up acceptable. Impeccable room service, prepared and attentive guys, pampered all guests during the evening.","2","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-08-15","2024-08-15","en","Atelier Moessmer Norbert Niederkofler","26683048","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r965023020-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Nice experience","Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia.
Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"".
We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers.
Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it.
Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts.
The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs.
One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way.
The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds. 
We're talking about smoked trout.
We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt.
Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs.
I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic.
Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect.
The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty.
The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles.
Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there.
The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble.
And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements.
At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient.
The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste.
For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders.
If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce.
Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be?
Maybe only salt is an exception.
I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement.
The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff.
The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed.
If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them.
This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars.
Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is.
However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times.
In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff.
Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room.
As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters.
Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been.

moessmer was one of the most surprising.
I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit.
In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved.
Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen.
The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques.
We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet.
Even the management, times and portions proved to be simply adequate for the experience.
Ultimately it is something that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates haute cuisine and this type of experience.

The reception was appropriate for a top house and the start in the salon, with the amouse bouche, was also very successful.
Afterwards there was a guided tour of the restaurant and in addition to the dining facilities, reference was also made to the company Moessmer, which owns the Villa.
Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression.
The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table.
But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain.
Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures.
In the end, the long walk was absolutely worth it and even if the expectations were already very high, they were even topped a bit.
Many thanks to the entire team for a memorable evening.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/cd/31/0d/caption.jpg

A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing. Considering the important price of the menu not appreciated the proposal of historical dishes off the list with additional cost to add.

Atmosphere: 5","Nice experience","Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia.
Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"".
We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers.
Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it.
Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts.
The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs.
One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way.
The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds. 
We're talking about smoked trout.
We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt.
Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs.
I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic.
Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect.
The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty.
The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles.
Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there.
The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble.
And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements.
At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient.
The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste.
For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders.
If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce.
Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be?
Maybe only salt is an exception.
I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement.
The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff.
The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed.
If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them.
This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars.
Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is.
However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times.
In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff.
Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room.
As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters.
Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been.
