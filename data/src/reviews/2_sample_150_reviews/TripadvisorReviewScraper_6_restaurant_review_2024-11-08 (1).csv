Food: 1","The overall dining experience fell short of expectations.","Despite its Michelin 1-star rating and a 4.2 out of 5 on Tabelog, my visit left much to be desired. The overall dining experience fell short of expectations.

The dishes at LATURE ranged from overly bland to excessively strong in taste, lacking the balance and finesse one would expect from a highly regarded establishment. It was disappointing that the kitchen seemed indifferent to how diners felt about their dishes. Whether it was a matter of personal preference or a genuine issue with the execution, the lack of attentiveness to customer satisfaction was disheartening.

While it's true that taste preferences vary, it's essential for a restaurant of this caliber to prioritize customer feedback and adapt accordingly. It's regrettable that this level of attention to detail was not evident during my visit.

Given the reputation and accolades, I had hoped for a more exceptional culinary experience. Unfortunately, LATURE did not meet those expectations, leaving a lasting impression of mediocrity. I believe there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of flavors, customer engagement, and overall execution.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/aa/f8/cd/caption.jpg

Food: 5","Exquisite game dishes","This restaurant specialises in game dishes.  The fixed chef's menu comprises many small courses, most of them including some form of game (on my first visit one of them was bear from Hokkaido).  The cooking and presentation are exquisite.  The atmosphere is refined but also friendly.  The wine list is very good and the sommelier provides excellent advice.","0","","NONE","2019-11-30","2020-10-29","2020-10-29","en","LATURE","11695471","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d11695471-r775964154-LATURE-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

We went just as the weather was turning autumnal and the ingredients in the course seemed to reflect this change. Presentation was delightful in its creativity (eating out of a book?!) and the portions were extremely generous, which I have found to be rare among French restaurants in Tokyo. My wife cried it tasted so good. The staff are very attentive and knowledgeable, and it was a classy touch for the chef to not only welcome us at our table, but to also accompany us out once we had eaten our fill. Thoroughly recommended.

It was a 6,400 yen (tax included) lunch course.

The dishes we had were as follows.

◯Amuse-bouche: Macaroons made with deer blood

→These macaroons are made with the blood that is drained from the venison that is served as the main course. They had a faint taste of venison in their sweetness. I was a little shocked when I heard the description of the dish, but it was delicious.

◯Jerusalem artichoke potage

→It was delicious, with a good balance of butter and cream.

◯Appetizer: A dish made with scallops, Japanese pepper, cacao, etc.

→The presentation was very good. However, I wasn't sure if the flavors of the multiple ingredients were well-married.

◯Game terrine

→A dish of bear, badger, deer, and wild boar game meat arranged in layers with foie gras. It was a unique dish. I don't often have the opportunity to eat bear, so I was interested in the taste of bear. However, the most delicious part was when the venison and foie gras were arranged next to each other.

◯Main: Venison
→The meat was so juicy that you wouldn't believe it was venison. The red wine sauce was also delicious.

◯Dessert: Kochi pomace and meringue
→The ginger flavor was good.

I was impressed with the concept of ""expressing gratitude to the animals whose lives were taken"" by using up all the venison's blood.
I was grateful that they were able to provide such delicious food for just 6,000 yen.
Thanks to the chef too.
Thank you for the meal.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/88/a6/49/caption.jpg
