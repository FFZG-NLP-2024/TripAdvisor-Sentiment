Atmosphere: 2","Extremely over-prised and overrated","That was so far the most expensive and overpriced dining (I would not dare to say ""fine"") experience I ever had in Vienna. 
Had to remind the waiters twice about the drink we ordered (actually, to refill the wine). 
We went for a vegan meal. Everything was overdone with either vinegar, or lemon, which made the food loose its taste. Some of the dishes (like cabbage we gave up on finishing) is simply hard to cut and share, leave alone the opportunity to dine with someone who is not your close family or couple. Would not come back or recommend going. Ended up paying 150 euro for two which is extremely over-prised for a dark-corner table without a warmer.","2","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-03","2024-03-03","en","Tian Restaurant Wien","2524649","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190454-d2524649-r940698300-Tian_Restaurant_Wien-Vienna.html"

Later, their response nasty response showed no understanding and never said sorry you were sick. Just awful. I have been all over the world and have eaten at Michelin starred restaurants including many top five worlds best restaurants from 50 best of Pellegrino Restaurants!!

The cuisine is vegetarian. I wanted to try it for something different than standard Austrian cuisine. We were not disappointed. The service was excellent and attentive. The dinner was an innovative approach to vegetarian dining. All the courses were delicious and satisfying. Eight courses. Everyone at the table did the wine or non-alcohol pairing and they were perfect. The wines were mostly white and from the Central European region around Austria. Excellent. We were satisfied and not overly full which is a good thing. Beautiful restaurant in convenient location.

Food: 4","4.5 for food, 3 for value for the money paid","So firstly, let me be transparent on the review; the cost was SHOCKINGLY high.  Yes, we saw (in advance) that it was going to be 140 Euros per person but the end bill, including tip was 450.  We had 5 glasses of wine between us (and there were 2 of us).  One has to pause and ask, unless money is no object, is anything worth this?  Of course the answer can be yes, but this just was not.  The size of each of the courses was small (except back to the roots, which had a variety).  I did not leave hungry but not filled either.  When we went, there were a few radish dishes (not my favorite veg) but then some tasty ones as well.  It really was a mix.  I have been to some amazing vegetarian places in NYC (including AbcV) which, quite frankly, knocks this one out of the park and about a 1/3 less  (and we are talking NYC here...).  So we did this once but would not go back.  If money is not an obstacle, then go.  Last thing is that the restaurant had this track in the background that was just odd music considering the vibe...it was a place that screamed for jazz or blues or something and it was like 1980s/90s hits...","1","","NONE","2022-04-30","2022-04-18","2022-04-18","en","Tian Restaurant Wien","2524649","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190454-d2524649-r835004816-Tian_Restaurant_Wien-Vienna.html"

They seemed to enjoy telling us all about the composition of the food and the drink pairings. The atmosphere at lunch time was comfortable and classy.  I am a vegan and they were more than up to the task of making delicious dishes. I would reccomend dining here to any vegan or vegetarian foodie but also enjoyable for meat eaters (my father who eats meat throughly enjoyed every course).","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/5f/34/83/vegan-parsnip-cheese.jpg
