Atmosphere: 5","20 out of 20 points...just great cooking","We love the concept of Etz: Brutally local and always the best products from locally. Super awesome also the experimental kitchen!
A grandiose late summer menu; aromas, colors and variety to sink in and get on your knees. Also the vegetarian menu was excellent. 
Be sure to try the non-alcoholic beverage accompaniment. Very creative.

Perfect service and incredibly exciting the open kitchen and the pass in the middle of the room.
A perfect wedding evening also with the fulfillment of special requests.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-08","2024-09-08","en","Etz","25238809","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d25238809-r968889994-Etz-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

Atmosphere: 1","weak and totally overrated","Totally overambitious ""philosophy ideas"" concept that in no way (!!!) ends up on the plate. The gourmet testers must have had a completely different evening, or who knows what... When you register by phone, the question about the menu is answered with: ""The chef creates new ideas every day"" - unfortunately, that's exactly true. I have ideas every day too, but they should end up on the plate. There is only a time window of about 30 minutes in which you can show up. Then there is the greeting in the back courtyard (""are we all doing well!!!"" yes - tschaka...); then the overly long ego-philosophical instruction by the maitre in the ""experimental library"" (actually a cold warehouse...); then (in the restaurant opposite) the corridors to the snack bar follow - they are all nice, but that's all. then comes the snack - which is good - but I can get that from my butcher for a fraction of the price; then a course with raw char topped with coarse sorrel leaves (picked personally in the morning, of course) - on top of that an ultra-buttery mixture (with a strong miso taste); by the way, everything somehow always tastes of fermented miso; almost penetrating) and a few lungwort petals that were also picked on the morning walk (corresponds to the ""philosophy"" mentioned above); thank God the char can be saved. then the next course is a ""12-year-old cow"" - that is, a fibrous, tough braised piece of the 12-year-old cow from which we were already able to enjoy the sausage (which was good); then a bit of dessert. at the end there are elderflowers baked in lard dough as a ""bonus and gift"" - they taste really good. paltry price = 235 euros (when I asked if there was a flat rate for water, I was given a flippant answer: ""whatever you want, you can drink yourself a water belly."" Water and coffee are included; no one in the service tells you this beforehand) - as for the wine accompaniment, which is available from the snack onwards: first a beer (delicious), then orange wine (horrible), then a medium-class white wine until the end - for a total of 125 euros!!! are you serious? and when I then read in gourmet guides or comments that this is a competitor to the ""essigbrätlein"" - then I honestly and truly know that there is absolutely no clue or something else going on here. By the way, the whole ""open kitchen concept"" with far too loud music (from disco to rap) and then of course correspondingly loud entertainment for the guests has the ""event character"" -- but do you really have to have it for 4 hours and end up paying 400 euros per person?","6","","FRIENDS","2024-05-31","2024-05-24","2024-05-24","en","Etz","25238809","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d25238809-r952203211-Etz-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Great cuisine, great concepts","Top gastronomy in Nuremberg, how nice. Great concepts with fermentation and the use of Franconian products. All courses were beautifully presented and tasted excellent. Service great. Beautifully set table (finally again!). The wine accompaniment is delicious, but could be a little more valuable for a few euros more. (The decision was made: that was my last natural wine in this life. I forgot to ask again, and one of them turned out to be a natural wine. Sorry guys, all angry and all the same. But that's just my opinion). To put it with Michelin: it's worth a detour. Definitely a big one. Thank you for the great evening.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-22","2024-03-22","en","Etz","25238809","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d25238809-r943396649-Etz-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Skilfully different star cuisine","Young and modern star cuisine that focuses on sustainability. Almost everything from bread to butter, sausages, vinegars, etc. is made in-house and purchased directly from - usually regional - producers. Animals are only bought whole and processed according to the ""nose to tail"" principle. The kitchen works with local products, although the preparations often follow international ideas, but sashimi is then served from trout, for example, or bottarga is made from the roe of local fish species. Exciting taste experiences, everything very skilfully prepared, interactive and well-organized service. Suitable and varied wine accompaniment. My personal highlight of the evening was the scrambled duck eggs with Judas ears and Franconian truffles.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/99/6f/2d/caption.jpg

Here we learned a little about the philosophy, the raw materials and the production. Everything is made in-house. From butter to vinegar, ham, bottarga, caviar and so on. They only work with raw materials and know all the producers personally. 
Then we went to the restaurant. You sit practically in the middle of it all - very close to the action and can watch the etz team create the individual courses. The atmosphere is totally relaxed. Everyone is on first name terms and that works. We felt totally at home. The courses were served by the entire team. You can see that all employees are important here, whether trainees, restaurant managers or dishwashers. Great working atmosphere! 
The food was of course also a dream. We had forest tea, mushroom bread, pork belly BBQ, Schlachtschüssel, snack, blue trout, Kellertrieb (my favorite), sugarloaf with sturgeon, Brillenschaf, Agnes Bernauer, coconut macaroon (without coconut) and a very delicious doughnut.
An evening at etz is absolutely recommended - we'll be happy to come back!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/95/b5/b8/caption.jpg

Impressive: the sustainable, regional philosophy, the perfection in detail, the great team that operates in an extremely non-hierarchical manner and always gives more than you expect. Just a few highlights: a small portion of marinated and seared pork belly, a wonderful mutton tartare with whipped turnips, a sensational kale mixture, dried wild boar with pea miso or sugar beet yoghurt with raspberry ice cream. Each course is creatively prepared with attention to detail and served and explained in a relaxed atmosphere.

Eating in a Michelin-starred restaurant for the first time. We chose the two-starred etz restaurant in Nuremberg.

The almost 5 hours we spent there are hard for me to put into words. The feeling that best describes it is intense!

The food, the ambience and the service. This high level of quality and teamwork!

The whole restaurant works like clockwork. The food and the accompanying wine are of course beyond any rating. It remains a deep and formative experience in top gastronomy.

What I would like to particularly emphasize here is that there is really no cliché that applies to etz.

The atmosphere was so incredibly relaxed. Despite the open restaurant, it was very intimate and informal.

An evening like this certainly costs as much as a short vacation. But anyone who is interested in the total work of art of top gastronomy should experience something like this!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/d5/ca/2b/caption.jpg

Outstanding value for money with maximum understatement.
