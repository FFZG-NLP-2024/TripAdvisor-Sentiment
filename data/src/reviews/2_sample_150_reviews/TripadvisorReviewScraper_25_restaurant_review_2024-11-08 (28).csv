Atmosphere: 4","Very disappointing;  be warned of the 30.6% extra $$ Where's the fresh farm produce?","After anticipating this dining experience for many years, when we did go it was such a let down. Dominique Crenn, we learned on arrival, was enjoying the Olympic games in Paris. Perhaps ""the cat was away and the mice did play?"" but this was a substandard experience at a cost approaching $2,000 (2 tasting menus plus 2 wine tastings at the lowest-priced option).

This was the height of summer, we live locally and our veggies and fruits in our small urban garden are plentiful and very delicious. So, when we were told by one of the numerous wait staff that the Atelier Crenn ""farm"" (in Sonoma county) was being featured, and that the farmer had just come to the restaurant, we were excited to experience some summer produce......Well that was not to be the case.

The tasting menu ($395 each, paid in advance through ""Tock"" app - on which they enforce adding a 20% tip, 8.6% tax, and 2% additional service - i.e. 30.6% upcharge to the price) is touted as having 16 (i believe) courses.

Well, most of the  courses are very small bites, meaning that several will come with a wine pour. That's fine, but the actual bites were so underwhelming.

No fresh tomatoes, zucchinis, peppers, salads, or fruits such as tomatoes and stone fruits were on the menu. No! I lie.... one of the desert tasting bites did have a 3 extremely small slivers of santa rosa black plums on avocado. Which, since we grow them and know how delicious they should be, we pulled off the smashed avocado/guacamole tostada to taste -- and the plum was sour! Like from a grocery store in the midwest! (I know since I was just in the midwest and had the same disappointment).  

There was another fresh item - fresh peas. That was our highlight of the meal. It had a great flavor, bright green color, and different textures that wowed our taste buds. The peas were an early tasting item, and unfortunately the rest of the bites were not so exciting. The other ""fresh"" item we enjoyed was a fried shiso leaf as part of their desert tasting bites and it made for a tasty surprise. A strawberry (one of the first courses) was described as green strawberry deconstructed and made into a mouse. It tasted rather odd and had a nasty texture. Talking of texture, we were not fans of the other mouse's they gave us. One was a walnut mouse which was rather plain tasting. I cannot tell you what the others were now.

There were 2 bread-ball courses. I prefer local Acme for breads, this was a rather uninspiring round ball - that at least helped fill our stomachs.

The different seafoods were pretty all disguised in different ways, the exceptions being a delicious crab broth, 2 shrimps served 2 ways (fried heads being one of them), plus there as a nice size bite of tuna - except it had gristle that after chewing I had to spit out! The server did not apparently notice this when clearing the plate (with a glob of chewed gristle), although the kitchen prep staff should not have served a piece with a gristle line.

I'd contacted the restaurant after the original booking since I had not added the ""drinks"" option to the ~$1,000 already paid when booking. I was told that the wine pairings were offered at $250, $480, and $1,225 depending on the wine list selected. Surprise! At the restaurant they offer these with the prices inclusive of all fees -- this means that you have no option but to pay 20% service (plus 2% additional service and the 8.6% tax) regardless. I'd have prefered to pay %15 on alcohol, but there you go.

Overall expect to pay a load of money - a 30.6% upcharge on any of their prices.

The atmosphere was good, the wait staff efficient  -- albeit several are difficult to understand especially when they are rushing through their descriptions, which several of the guys were. Our favorite server was from the actual kitchen and she was very descriptive plus friendlier, to be honest! The men were rather stuffy and arrogant and, as mentioned, talked rapidly, often with English as a second language, so we had to ask them to repeat sever times.

Our $300-a-person wine pairing was decent (we got the California wine selection), especially some of the wine pourings from southern CA. Our favorite was a light rose from Two Wolves in Santa barbara. That said, although we experienced some wines new to us, the pourings are small and they do not top you up (except one red which was stretched to several of the tasting ""courses"" and they told us would be repeated). In future (not that there probably will be - since it was that disappointing) I would order a bottle from the wine list and forgo the >$600 we paid on wine tastings.

The place is small and several people were in sneakers and jeans but others were more dressed up.

The place was not fully booked -- so perhaps they are not as popular anymore. I can understand if this is the case, this truly was a time that we were expecting a 5 star experience with the fresh local seafood and garden/farm produce. Instead it is more of a ""guess what this is"" and ""find the local fresh produce if you can"" experience we probably will not repeat -- there are many other options in San Francisco!

Hopefully Dominique will take note of this and things will revert to the experience she used to tout!

We left feeling very disappointed, but made a joke out of it when we told our friends. Really, it was too sad so we had to laugh.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/21/97/4b/caption.jpg

I’m equally impressed now as I was when I  first visited 18 months ago. Such freshness, such bold flavors, such creativity!  Seafood and Vegetables were the stars of the meal with the “cherry bomb,” the carrot and pea taco, the cauliflower and caviar,  and the beets and leche de tigre the standouts. The dry aged black cod with sides was superb. The restaurant’s redesign for 2023 gave it an airy and light feel. The overall experience (phenomenal dinner, visiting the food chefs in the kitchen, the pastry chefs in their kitchen, and delicious desserts in Bar Crenn) was worth the money and definitely worthy of its 3 stars.

Food: 5","An artistic presentation that intellectually challenged ones' sensory understanding of food","The dinner was an artistic presentation that intellectually challenged ones' sensory understanding of food.  Chef Crenn's techniques decomposed common ingredients and then reconstituted them artistically to create new flavors and texture.   The food was extremely delicate and required a lot of concentration to appreciate.  The meal reminded me of the wholesome California spirit of Chez Panisse in the 1970's, the sophistication and precision of Jamin in the 1980's, and the creativeness of Ferran Adria in the 2000's.   A thoroughly enjoyable dinner. 

For wine, we had a 4 year old Corton Charlemagne from a vintage that is early maturing.  The wine tased like butter scotch in the first 45 minutes, evolved to pineapple cream in the next 45 minutes, but then shut down for the remaining meal.  Perhaps it needed 5 or 10 more years of aging.

It's a tasting menu and yes, the bite sizes are small, but we did not leave hungry - nor were we stuffed - it really was the right amount of food spread out over 2 hours. It's a very small space with just eight tables, which explains why it's so hard to get a reservation. We didn't do the wine pairings instead opting to have full bottles of wine. The wine prices however, we more than a little exhobanant but the wines were delicious.

Food: 4","Hard to reserve, wonderful service, beautiful food, loud.","Atelier Crenn

After trying at least 3 different times, including a wait list, wife and I obtained a reservation for a midweek evening.    The restaurant accepts only pre-paid ($410 per person with add-ons for chef’s tasting menu, no other choice. Service included.) reservations with wine, supplements, etc. paid at end of meal. From the outset, the staff (perhaps as many as patrons) were welcoming, warm, and always attentive.  The layout is supposed to resemble at atelier with a central open space, some paintings, and a number of nooks, with framed poems on walls. There was also a sheet of poem on each table, a pretty long poem that took a while to read if you were so inclined.  The atmosphere was somewhat dignified and conducive until more patrons arrived and all talked and laughed loudly – then it became quite loud which was annoying for us sedate diners.  The 14+ course dinner (without wine pairing, but with a glass of champagne each, a half bottle of white wine, and a supplemental caviar course) was overall delicious including some unexpected delights, like the first course – an icy cold ball that burst in the mouth.  For a Pescatarian restaurant, however, we were much of the time unable to taste the pesces in the food.  Each dish was visually attractive, artfully prepared, intricately constructed (or deconstructed), many to be eaten in one bite. The teeny bites, however, were largely, very tasty.  There were several dishes, e.g. the deconstructed onion soup, black cod, that were identifiable, not teeny, and excellent.  The “moving feast” involved our moving, after the main course, to the Bar Crenn next door for the dessert and after dinner drinks following a brief tour through the kitchens.  Bar Crenn had the look of a 1920’s comfortable bar.  Overall, this atelier presents visually beautiful petite dishes, with very good to excellent taste and outstanding attentive service.  The final bill came to $1,200 of which $820 was prepaid at reservation.  Dining in this exclusive 3 starred Michelin restaurant, with its memorable service, savoring the artful yet uneven palate pleasers, was an experience!","0","","NONE","2022-06-30","2022-06-12","2022-06-12","en","Atelier Crenn","2001299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r842598282-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html"

Food: 2","So disappointing and WE found a hair in our food!","I was visiting friends for a week of gastronomy delights and we were told to try this restaurant, but we were so disappointed! Although the food was  presented beautifully, there was nothing extraordinary or memorable about and not one of us enjoyed any dish on the tasting menu. We also upgraded and added truffles to some of our dishes and even that didn't uplift the flavour. In addition, we added the wine pairing for an extra $250 per person and only 1 of the wines they paired, were enjoyable for us.

What was worse was my friend found a hair on her plate with the second dish and while they did apologise, no compensation of a glass of wine was offered. They didn't even appear embarrassed! If you are paying $395 per person and in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, you do not expect to find a hair in your food! Yes, mistakes happen but the restaurant did not even care or make up for it with a proper apology or a gesture of compensation, by a drink or something!

Although the staff were friendly, service was also slow. The atmosphere was also lacking and very pretentious. I can no stand places that give the feeling that their establishment is better than their patrons and their reaction to the hair on the plate compounded it! We were so disappointed.

Two days later, we found ourselves in Napa and at the French Laundry, which was absolutely amazing and restored my faith in what a real, 3 Michelin star restaurant is all about!

Skip it and save your money.","3","","NONE","2022-04-30","2022-05-02","2022-05-02","en","Atelier Crenn","2001299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r836953848-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html"

I was a bit leery of on a non-meat dinner service but was blown away by the creative, innovative, fresh and extremely tasty fish and vegetable dishes. I highly recommend you request the wine pairing with the dinner since the synergy between them elevated both. The dishes were artfully presented by a courteous and professional staff who took pride in their work and the food prepared for us. It was a pleasure to meet the executive chef, sous chefs, and pastry chef when we transitioned from the dinner service at Atelier Crenn to the dessert service at Bar Crenn. It is easy to see why Dominique Crenn’s restaurant in the Cow Hollow district of San Francisco is a 3* Michelin Restaurant and consistently rated in the top 50 restaurants of the world…PERFECTION!!!! If you’re a foodie this restaurant should be at the top of your must do bucket list!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/22/be/44/f8/caption.jpg

The chef and her staff totally understand all elements of restaurant hospitality, starting with the delicious and innovative menu, but extending to the ambiance and professional but incredibly friendly service. We selected the “movable feast” tasting menu experience and, after consultation with the Sommelier, the wine pairing (I note that the wine pairing was not at all “pushed”). Every course was beautiful and delicious. We have had the privilege to dine at what are considered some of the best restaurants in the world and Atelier Crenn is right up there with them.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/20/f9/2d/cc/caption.jpg

Food: 5","Definitely One of the World's Top 50","Growing up a meat eater in Texas doesn't prepare one for Atelier Crenn but Creen does make you happy you escaped the state for a healthier life in California!  From the very beginning of this experience the existential philosophy of ethical hedonism sustainability is stamped upon your forehead.  While the food is definitely fine art it is also belly friendly and the portion sizes are most definitely perfectly sized for  long evening.  Some other fine dining locations should take note.  At the close of the meal is the dessert courses which are nothing short of pure genius!  We were laughing at the table over the audacity of the creative team in the kitchen!  Our only critique of the evening would be the disappointment in the wine pairings especially as most of them had a heavy carbon footprint and were out of step with the local sustainability so well executed on the menu.  While there were some of the top Napa and Sonoma names on the greater wine list there was a decidedly lack of incorporation of these great local wines into the sustainable presentations.  An organic producer from Europe just doesn't meet the sustainability ethos.  When I return we will pay corkage or order some great local wines!  The abalone was ridiculous and made me remember the day I met George Moscone and had abalone at the 
Waterfront.  Just a great day to remember!  Finally and most importantly the wait staff was impeccable!  But remember to bring your wallet as this joint isn't cheap!","2","","NONE","2021-05-31","2021-06-04","2021-06-04","en","Atelier Crenn","2001299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r791181960-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html"

Food: 5","Not only was my mouth and stomach singing, my brain too!","We came for our wedding anniversary.  My husband had made the reservations a month before.  We went for the early seating. From the street, the location appeared pretty nondescript. We even walked passed it and had to double back. Upon entering, we were graciously  received by staff and escorted to our table.  The interior had a lot of wood, muted colors, with small area rugs that separated diners into their space.  There was poetry on the walls, which we were told, were written by Chef Crenn.  There were little paintings that are the work of her father. The entire place is a tribute to him. 
Our servers were all gracious and informative.  It was not so easy to hear them because of the noise coming from the kitchen.  Our evening was punctuated by several people somewhere deep in the kitchen (I did not peek) saying or chanting something in unison, almost like a declaration of teamwork or something.  It was a little jarring after a while. We had to keep asking our servers to repeat their explanations. And it made the dining area noisy with the sounds bouncing.  I had a hard time hearing the music, although, once, when it was quiet for a few minutes, I heard David Bowie singing.  How apropos!
Our food was served with so much aesthetic sense and beauty, I had to pause with each course just to admire them. Some courses were put together in front of us. Each dish did not just have this exquisite complexity that played out in our mouths.  The unique umami each delivered was either a welcome assault or an insidious flood of flavor followed by a lingering aftertaste that truly satisfied. The dish with the coarsely ground pumpkin seeds brought back childhood memories of when I went with my parents to my mother's home town.  I had not thought about that in decades!
I had so many favorites: the dish that looked like a rose. The abalone.  The snow made of creme fraiche (I think) that topped seafood delight, that melted the minute I put it in my mouth.  The slow cooked eggyolk with all layers piled on top of it.  They had this walnut baguette that  had such a balanced taste, texture, and flavor, I would have wanted more, but I knew better than to ask.  There was still so much in store to come.  My husband is lactose intolerant but was willing to have a little dairy only.  They substituted ingredients so beautifully that the same dish was just was stellar. 
The service was gracious, not overbearing or intrusive.  The team worked like members of a dance ensemble.  My husband told me that every time I came out of the bathroom, one of the staff came to check it.  The customer team was precise and meticulous with their attention to detail.  
There are some restaurants with such high Michelin ratings I have been to where I said that once was good and enough.  But this one, I'd go back in a heartbeat!","2","","NONE","2020-01-31","2020-01-08","2020-01-08","en","Atelier Crenn","2001299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r737922696-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html"

During the evening we felt two stars were not enough for the entire experience. Few weeks later the third star announcement! Every bite was a dance of flavors, balanced and complex, exciting and new but not in often “trying too hard to be original strangeness,” and also has down to earth comforting flavors as well. Do get the special addition of caviar. Worth the $$$. I appreciate the touch of Japanese influence in some of the dishes. One of the most memorable meals ever! Prefer over French Laundry..... Service elegantly choreographed but I wouldn’t mind slightly less formal. A gasp heard when tiny errant parsley or drop of foam noticed where it did not belong...haha. It’s okay! Beautiful elegant but low key room (some young ?tech dudes came in shorts and flip flops-sorry I think disrespectful to all the detail and artistry of Crenn; most patrons more tasteful and appropriately attired but not overdressed). Personal paintings by her father make it extra special. Meeting Chef Dominique Crenn who visited each table seemed natural unforced and was lovely. My teens especially loved the multi-course desserts! Hope not too difficult to make a future reservation now given the third star for this SF jewel.
