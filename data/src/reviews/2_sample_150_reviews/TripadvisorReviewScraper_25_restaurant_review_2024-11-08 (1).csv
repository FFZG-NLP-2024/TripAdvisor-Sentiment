The welcome was cordial and the design of the place let us expecting a nice moment to come.
In fact, it was not as we expect and I would say a big disappointment.
The amuse bouche was not so original and tasteless, a Gravelax trout that we could not recogner the taste with a spice less guacamole.
The starters with ingredients we could not recognise like the Parmesan tile neither by the taste, neither by the way they have been cooked.
The fish was over cooked and the the side dishes proposed did not match the dish.
And finally the dessert even if it was a best seller and described as peak of the dinner by the waiter was not at all what we call a fireworks.
So our only conclusion, as the place was empty that night (3 tables only), something has happened not to have the right ingredients in the kitchen, not to have the right people cooking, not to have the standard quality of s’écrive expected for this type of restaurant for the price we paid (100euro per person).
I would recommend the restaurant manager to go back to basics. To make sure the customers can give comfortably  straight feedback as the behaviour of the waiters made us feel that we were the root cause of the bad evening we have spent. Bon courage to make it better.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/bc/c5/70/caption.jpg

The roof top terrace bar was excellent. Great staff and lovely cocktails with an amazing view of cognac and the surrounding countryside. 
We ate in La Distillerie restaurant where unfortunately things were not so good. 
Service was poor and rushed, and the staff seemed miserable with little conversation or introduction of dishes. The white wine was served warm with an excuse of hot weather outside! Maybe keep the wine in a working fridge? 
The food was average. Undercooked fish, basic starter, bland dessert and too much emphasis on ‘decoration’ rather than taste. 
Wish we had looked for a local, owner/chef restaurant rather than a ‘look at my star’ venue. 
Expensive meal and left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.

The risotto (the only vegetarian option) was delicious, albeit some more vegetables in it would have been nice. The cheese selection was tasty, albeit I was surprised it was served with a salad and not crackers. 

Wines available by the glass were limited, however those tried were very good (white and red). In terms of service, not attentive (water glasses not replenished, no check on how the food was a few moments after starting to dine, bread provided but no plate or butter knife). As courses were delivered, there was no announcing them - and one actually delivered to the empty table when I was at the restroom. There was also a mix up with a dish being served with an allergen I had advised them off. The manager (Antony) handled the issue well, was sincere in his apology and kindly offered a complementary cognac in recompense.","1","","NONE","2022-04-30","2022-04-23","2022-04-23","en","La Distillerie","15324859","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187205-d15324859-r835700228-La_Distillerie-Cognac_Charente_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

This is not a 5 star hotel restaurant. It is a 3 star hotel buffet restaurant with tables packed tightly together, and serving large groups

There is meant to be a proper restaurant as well. We were not told that it was closed, but only on  inquiring did we find out that it is closed for an extended period

Hence the Distillerie and its buffet is the only option

We had booked Dinner, Room and Breakfast. The set dinner with a choice of 2 starters and 2 main courses was the same each night. When I suggested to the staff that this was not acceptable, they came back with other options after a half hour wait

The staff wanted us to take the buffet, which we did not want.

As I said this is a mass catering restaurant, with a capacity of over 100, serving buffet food to groups, and not the restaurant I would expect in a 5 star hotel","0","","NONE","2019-08-31","2019-08-20","2019-08-19","en","La Distillerie","15324859","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187205-d15324859-r700948203-La_Distillerie-Cognac_Charente_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Beautiful, tasteful, elegant, we spent almost an hour just enjoying the architecture.

The atmosphere is very friendly, with a Director of the restaurant who hosts brunch with the delicious Suzette pancakes, a caring team and with little care, a considerate service, moreover the presence of a smiling cook in the room for cutting meat is a real plus. My favorite the little cognac baba, a real treat.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","La Distillerie","15324859","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187205-d15324859-r978255263-La_Distillerie-Cognac_Charente_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"
