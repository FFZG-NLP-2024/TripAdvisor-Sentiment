Gric is the perfect mix of elegance and simplicity and encapsulates Slovenia's food culture is such a beautiful way. Mostly everything we had was made with ingredients grown in their garden which we had a full view of. The food was amazing and timed out perfectly.

We arrived with memories of very tasty food, but also of slow service. We hoped to see improvement on that front, but unfortunately, our experience did not start or end well.

We waited for an amuse-bouche for almost 40 minutes, which was quite long, and we had expected quicker service. The first appetizer was served after another half hour, and the waiting time between meals remained long throughout the diner. It was at least twice the time that would be acceptable. After more than three hours, I mentioned the issue to the (otherwise very pleasant and friendly) waiters, but it had no effect on the pace of service. It took us over 5 hours to complete the 11-course meal. Moreover, the lack of air conditioning made the environment very hot, especially during a hot summer day.

While I thought the food was nice, I would definitely not repeat the experience again. I discreetly emailed my comments to the restaurant the next day, and I received a reply after two weeks. They apologized and mentioned delayed reconstructions, and they expressed hope that we would be fully satisfied next time. Bad excuse, because no one mentioned anyting during our reservation, upon arrival or when paying the bill. Not to mention that this was our third ‘slow’ experience, and that portable air conditioners are now sold at a lower price than the cost of a single dinner. 

However, after careful discussion with other guests who were also present, we decided that three opportunities were enough. A Michelin-starred restaurant should provide a full service experience, not just good food.","2","","FAMILY","2023-06-30","2023-07-25","2023-07-25","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r905563585-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

No explanation about the food.  That's something.  Freshwater fish are offered as sea fish.  Poor selection of wines by the glass for such an expensive restaurant.  Describing tannins in white wine (?!) is almost alarming.  Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.  The fish was tasteless, too greasy, practically inedible in the unfortunate combination.
 The only positive thing was a really nice and good dessert, and of course the beautiful white landscape.
 In short, STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND!","1","","COUPLES","2023-01-31","2023-01-23","2023-01-23","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r876113603-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

They are committed to their homeliness and all ingredients are local.
Every dish is perfect, the flavors combine perfectly and we can feel their dedication on the plate. They use ingredients that are not used in other restaurants and don’t use “luxury” ingredients, but with this they make perfect dishes. Every bite is poetry.

What an amazing restaurant! We did the 7-course menu and it was unreal. We lived in Manhattan for 7 years so we have eaten at some amazing restaurants and this was by far the best we ever had. Each dish was so perfectly prepared and we experienced flavors we never had before. Also the wine pairing was fantastic and my husband did the non-alcoholic version that was even better with incredible juices, kombuchas, teas, etc. Thank you Henry for your meticulous work on those! It was 7 courses but with the chefs greetings and bonus desserts it felt more like 20. We loved all the local ingredients and felt like it was a truly authentic experience — they didn’t try too hard, it was just right. We loved loved loved all the dishes. Unlike other Michelin restaurants where you leave hungry, we were stuffed by the end (in a good way!) hope to return here one day!!! Thank you to the chef and staff for such a memorable experience!","0","","COUPLES","2022-09-30","2022-09-02","2022-09-02","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r857938460-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

Once again the food was innovative and beautiful. I liked the dishes I ate in September slightly more than this time, but you have to know they use only homegrown, local, and foraged foods which vary throughout the seasons. Overall I was satisfied with everything and once again impressed by the flavors and the smart usage of wild leaves etc. Yes, expensive, but the price is normal for a Michelin star restaurant and if you know how to cherish gourmet food, you will understand that you pay for an experience.","0","","NONE","2022-05-31","2022-05-26","2022-05-26","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r840087203-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

Food: 1","fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me","I heard it used to be a nice and good restaurant. Good inns are often hidden in remote locations - this is NOT the case here. The house is nothing special from the outside, nor is it inside, but it is poorly heated space - maybe they don't have firewood?!.
The 3.5-hour time consuming food service consists of surrealistically small portions with a quasi-artistic touch and a high price. The “Michelin star” is vulgarly exploited to find the upper limit of guests ’naivety & stupidity. It all looks like a bad joke. To be able to separate the dish from the decoration, the staff constantly explains the composition of the miniature food brought on small pedestals. I also saw the head chef at the next table, he was quite a big guy - I thought - he probably eats somewhere else. The wine is good but nothing special.

CONCLUSION: this is not a restaurant, this is a very expensive and time consuming tasting of miniature portions of edible dishes ...

NOTE: Eat something good before visiting them and make sure you have enough money in your wallet…","8","","NONE","2022-03-31","2022-03-25","2022-03-25","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r832311306-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

We’ve even recommend it to others. 
This last visit disappointed us so much, the restaurant sadly decided to minimize their portions and also the atmosphere changed. 
Plates in summer 2021, post second covid lockdown, aren’t what they were in 2020 or even before. I would estimate they are 3 times smaller now! 
We’ve been offered 2 pieces of bread throughout the evening, which is borderline insulting, the staff didn’t ask - not even once - if we are satisfied with the food, not even at the end when we left. 
Food was mediocre, but most of all - it was tiny. 7 tiny plates for 60 euros, every plate consisted of maximum 2 bites with the main course being a joke. A small piece of fish. 
So hungry now we are going for a take out, after spending 150 euros for nothing - a few bites!! 
It’s sad to see what happened with this restaurant and sadly none of my family or friends will be returning. 
Im not sure if saving money by minimizing the portions was worth it. Here are the photos of an entree, main dish and desert - you decide for yourself!","8","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/49/40/ff/gric-luka-kosir.jpg

Service was good, providing also detailed information on dishes, rhytm of service just as one would expect in a high level restaurant. Quite elaborate sommelier's recommendations with menus. Wine list reather unorthodox, covering well Slovenia and Collio (emphasis on orange wines), a connoisseur might miss some essential foreign entries. Elegant plates, completely different for each dish, proper glasses. I liked the food the first time, it now got even better and more sparkingly creative. The two five course menus are both excellent and well worth their price considering a wide range of amuse bouche and petit fours servings. Seasonality rules. Easily 16+ on my 1-20 scale for the culinary experience. 

Definitely worth a detour on a route, or a targeted drive from Ljubljana. Definitely one of the top ten in Slovenia already now, aspiring to get even higher soon...","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/08/36/c4/veal-shoulder.jpg

Till now I was always excited and I felt really enthusiastic approach. This time was first surprise that they had only 3 menus and with different varieties of same ingredients, so no chance for something more common as beef stake or similar and to many combinations of different tastes and ingredients which were not composed into a harmony. Also inexperienced new young waiter wasn’t handle service well, so final experience was a little bit disappointing. Maybe was the last day before closing for holidays but I suggest guests to check offer before reservation.

The food was delicious and surprising from the first serving until recently.
The combination of ingredients from local nature ingredients and dishes was amazing and sensational.
We were very impressed by creativity, daring and imagination of the chef who served delicious and intriguing dishes and a right amount one by one.
The dessert that combined yogurt, vanilla ice cream with delicate saltiness on a bed of pine scales and pine needles syrup was amazing.
We enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, the wine and the nice staff.

We will strongly recommend","0","","FAMILY","2019-07-31","2019-08-03","2019-08-02","en","GRIČ - LUKA KOŠIR","5267378","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r695086344-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"
