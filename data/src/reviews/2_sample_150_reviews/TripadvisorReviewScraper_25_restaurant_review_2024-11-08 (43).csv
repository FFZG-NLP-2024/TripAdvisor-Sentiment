Nice cozy place with two floors, helpful staff, delicious food, and really affordable prices (average bill for a lunch with wine for 2 people is 45€).
And this restaurant is also in the Michelin guide of 2018 and 2019.

Food: 4","Savvy Choice","One of Michelin's few picks in town and a wise one. The ambiance is pleasing, the welcome is cordial, and most importantly, the cooking is to a high standard. Of course, with one meal you can't fully assess a restaurant's strengths and weaknesses. Our fish (Saint Pierre) was beautifully cooked in a Staub pot along with a fine array of vegetables. Simple, but the flavors matched perfectly.

A chocolate dish was also straightforward, but of high quality. As restaurants adapt to people drinking less, I wish they would offer a larger array of half bottles. A decent Chablis was one of the very few choices of a suitable white wine.

A very good, moderately priced restaurant.","1","","COUPLES","2019-05-31","2019-05-22","2019-05-22","en","L'Air du Temps","1379455","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196534-d1379455-r675709652-L_Air_du_Temps-Saint_Brieuc_Cotes_d_Armor_Brittany.html"

We dined here the first night of our holiday and enjoyed our meal so much that we returned later in the week.

We were given a friendly welcome both evenings. The restaurant which is fairly small but has an upper floor, was busy so we were fortunate to have booked a table. It seemed to be popular with locals - always a good sign and we didn’t hear any other English speaking diners. We speak some French although English is understood by the staff.

The 17.90 Euro three course menu is good value with plenty of choice. The restaurant specialises in casseroles served in a cast iron pot (‘cocotte’) for both fish and meat dishes, served with vegetables in a bouillon. This is left on the table and you help yourself. An ‘amuse-bouche’ (no charge) is served whilst you are choosing from the menu or with an aperitif. On our second visit it included olives and crispy radish. As a starter I particularly enjoyed the home-made gazpacho especially the delicious and inventive beetroot and raspberry vinegar version. The desserts included a tasty apricot panna cotta on our second visit. The only disappointment was my partner’s cheese plateau which only had a selection of two small strips of cheese with a heap of lettuce!

During our week long stay in Saint-Brieuc L’Air du Temps was our favourite restaurant that we visited.

They had a lot of different tastes in one item which blended together really well.
I was served by a young intern who was working there for a week and she knew exactly what she was doing and was doing a fantastic job.

It turned out a value of a dinner and a dinner of value. 
Fabulous starters of flavourful tender veal and genuine foie gras in its very natural form,  all prepared with care and love. Then it was all about fish for both of us, all served in identical homely cast iron pots with selection of steamed vegetables but cooked with different sauce. The fish were cod and a flat variety,  sort of turbot. Both were outright delicious, especially being accompanied with Touraine Sauvignon. 
We topped it all off with fried apricots seasoned with a lot of other goodness and had some scrumptious dessert wine and 1966 Armagnac for good measure. 
Tell us we don't know what fine dining is all about. 
Finally, it came down to very reasonable 130 Eu, modest tip included. ","0","","COUPLES","2017-08-31","2017-08-08","2017-08-08","en","L'Air du Temps","1379455","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196534-d1379455-r510200104-L_Air_du_Temps-Saint_Brieuc_Cotes_d_Armor_Brittany.html"

We arrived in typically Breton rain and were warmly welcomed, despite my having booked for six covers instead of eight - a problem swiftly sorted out with good grace by the manager.

All dishes were nicely cooked and well presented. We particularly liked the way the two children's meals were served - other restaurants could learn from this.

It is a blessed place. Our lunch there will be remembered. Kudos for everything we experienced there - foie gras and sardines toast for starte, monkfish and rabbit for the mains followed by hot chocolate cake and peppermint ice cream. The wine suggestions by the head waiter were hard to beat. All topped by excellent service from the team.
