It was founded by chef Rasmus Munk in 2015. In 2016, Lars Seier Christensen (co-founded Saxo Bank, resigned in 2016), an investor of the three-Michelin restaurant Geranium in Copenhagen, approached Rasmus Munk, hoping to take the restaurant ""Alchemist"" to a new level and decided to create an unprecedented restaurant experience. Alchemist 2.0 opened on July 4, 2019. In just a few years, this two-Michelin-star restaurant led by chef Rasmus Munk was ranked 18 (2022), 5 (2023), and 8 (2024) on the Best 50 list, and was called the most immersive restaurant ever.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/1e/26/31/caption.jpg

Without doubt the best restaurant meal I have eaten in my life.

From the moment your arrive at this Copenhagen dockside warehouse, and enter the restaurant lobby, it is a sensory overload of the best sort.

It's not cheap, but at the same time represents amazing good value for money. It is like going out to dinner and visiting the theatre, art gallery, school and the movies at the same time.

You eat the best food. Very cleverly and creatively cooked by the super talented Rasmus Munk and team. The original presentation and ideas make you think and you learn. It really is, very, very clever. Perhaps unique. 

The fact that the service is superb, authentic and unstuffy helps make this the ultimate fine dinning experience.

Other than having the patience required to wait to get a rare table reservation, there is no downside. The Alchemist is the best fine dinning experience ever.

We loved it. Every foodie should go at least once.

We will return!","1","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-07-29","2024-07-29","en","Alchemist","8547060","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r962280245-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

To start with we arrived there earlier and they managed to get us in earlier, even offered a poncho - as I was cold - in case we would have waited. Needless to say it’s certainly kicked off our experience in a great way. The entry room took us by surprise in a fantastic way and managed to get us in the mood even more. We wanted to try the bunny ears cocktail, which we did and highly recommended then the magic of the food started flowing. Me and my partner went there with very open mind, which is needed to fully understand and appreciate the amazing work what Rasmus and his team does. Every single dish was on an other level, what we both have ever tasted even if there was one or two more challenging dishes. Service was exceptional throughout the evening and all of their knowledge of the food and beverage. Our host, Hannah was very professional with a cracking sense of humor. All of the team member has such a great character, which we were both pleased to see. Booking a table can be stressful as tickets are gone within a very short time but certainly worth to go through the nerve wracking time till you managed to be quick enough to reserve a spot :)","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-23","2024-04-23","en","Alchemist","8547060","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r948029549-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

We were looked after by Nandi, Mireia and Nina for the bulk of our meal and the service was excellent and it was so wonderful being able to have a chat and get to know them. 

I truly can not express how mind bogglingly awesome this place is and it was wonderful being guided to see the experimental kitchen and even getting to meet Rasmus himself!

Atmosphere: 5","One word: NO","I had high hopes for our dinner at Alchemist. It definitely started strong. At the middle of the dinner, I thought to myself: wow, this is the best restaurant in the world. The food was delicious, the wine list incredible, and the décor spectacular. Yet, after an hour, we received odd dishes. Including: lamb’s brain, jelly fish, pigs windpipe, ice cream made with pig’s blood. I was sick the next day.

What is the purpose of serving those ingredients? I enjoyed the beginning of the meal but at the end I felt abused and sick to my stomach. 

Alchemist could have been the best restaurant in the world. It is spectacular, with exceptional service and superb gastronomic capabilities. It just needs to let go of the exotic ingredients. It can shift from being one of the worst restaurants in the world to one of the best with just minor changes. 

We left the restaurant traumatized. We felt as if we were the chef's guinea pigs. We felt abused and sick.","51","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/43/6f/20/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-09-06","2023-09-06","en","Alchemist","8547060","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r915183775-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

Our dinner lasted about 5 hours and consisted of 30 separate dishes plus 2 special drinks.  I agree with the many other reviews that the food and the overall experience at Alchemist is outstanding.  

We must have interacted with 15-20 different servers. Service was impeccable and very friendly. 

I was surprised to learn that you only eat in three rooms - I was expecting more.  Appetizers are served in the bar where you can order a cocktail.  Dinner is served in the main dining room where everyone sits at one very large counter.  You then have desserts and coffee in a third room.

We ordered the wine pairings partly because I thought we would be changing rooms frequently. With hindsight, we should have ordered a bottle and/or glasses of wine.  The pairings were excellent but we’re not wine aficionados and we could have saved a lot of money.

We had a reservation for 7:00 which turned out to be rather late as most guests had arrived before us.  (The restaurant opens at 5:00.)  If I get the chance to return I will book earlier.

I was told that a 4 person reservation is the easiest to get and a 6 person is the hardest.  Also, the sommeliers table is not a separate table - you sit at the counter like everyone else but enjoy their top-of-the-line wine service.

We stopped at Mikkelker Baghaven prior to dinner. It’s about a 5-minute walk to the Alchemist and is a good pre-dinner option.

Highly recommended.","6","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/a9/6b/2b/caption.jpg

The service was amazing, both prior to our visit (from the people in the office) and during, from the kitchen and waiters. Our server was very attentive and told us a lot about the wines, which were very good.

Will try to book again and come back <3 hope to take the kids here too when they're old enough to appreciate it.

My partner has some pictures that I will try to upload later.","1","","NONE","2023-01-31","2023-03-09","2023-03-09","en","Alchemist","8547060","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r881530382-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

I’ve definitely had better tasting food, but never in this context. Highly recommended.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/0b/dd/71/caption.jpg","FRIENDS","2022-11-30","2022-11-26","2022-11-26","en","Alchemist","8547060","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r869805726-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"
