Thierry Schwartz’s cuisine is on one hand quite innovative with local products but the taste experience is unfortunately limited.

Another aspects should not be underestimated: Approximately 90% of the wine list are “natural wines”. For those who do not like this style of wine which is very different to delicate wines (based on wine making processes developed over centuries!) this is another big disappointment. Bio dynamic wine making doesn’t mean automatically fantastic wine taste (unfortunately!). This new „movement“ is anyhow a big miracle…

Gimmicks like making fresh butter at the table are gratuitous! - We ate already many delicate cremes in several Michelin Star restaurants and not everybody loves simple butter.

The service is definitely very kind and attentive!

Summary: 
Why got Thierry Schwartz „1 Michelin star“? Definitely the worst „Michelin star restaurant“ experience so far - and we tested this level up to 3 stars all over the world 😉. Not value for money and a disappointing experience 😢 which we didn’t have very often fortunately 😃","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/31/84/2e/caption.jpg

We try to never set expectations while trying out a new place but this place with their food and hospitality just blew us away. We chose the 5 course meal with drinks, the pairings for each course was fantastic. Everyone was super nice and I loved that they used a lot of products from the region from the mushrooms to the wine. They took great care to explain to us each dish and created this really nice immersive experience . By the end of the night our stomach and heart was full. Definitely recommend this place if you are in Alsace next time.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/26/a0/2a/40/thierry-schwartz-le-restaurant.jpg

Five course menu (124€) was: (1) a green salad, some unfresh leaves; (2) one spear of asparagus (very nice); (3) a small piece of farmed char (floury consistency); (4) a little bit of white and brown chicken meat (dry); (5) one piece of rhubarb (not fully cooked).
This is no exaggeration.

The ambiance is very nice. The service was lovely and theatrical, if not perfect. They bake your bread and churn your butter. Very nice people.
The wine list is outstanding.
The products are no doubt good. But how can you charge so much for such basic, uncreative and - frankly - poorly prepared food.","3","","COUPLES","2022-04-30","2022-04-30","2022-04-30","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r836698125-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

This really was one of the best lunches that I have had.    I don't know the cost as it was included in our tour, but whatever it was, it was worth it. The focus is on local, seasonal food cooked to perfection in thoughtful and different ways.   Of great note were the strawberries soaked in balsamic for a year and then halved and served as an appetiser.  A signature dish was the egg ravioli entree. The main course was beef which was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth; the asparagus flowerhead were unusual accompaniment; bread was freshly cooked and brought to the table still warm.  The highlight though was the dessert - a tomato asked in honey with strawberry jus.  Local wines were served throughout.  Service was attentive and excellent.  A wonderful experience.","4","","COUPLES","2019-06-30","2019-07-14","2019-07-13","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r689385093-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

The premises are not particularly special- bare boards and beamed ceilings, rather tea-shop like. The speciality  of M Schwartz is local tastes and ingredients. On the whole this works well. Quality is very good, though some dishes on the set menu are a bit fiddly or unsatisfying.. there is also a slight problem with the staff, who have a tad to much attitude to make one feel at one,s ease when confronted with the unfamiliar. Decent wine list majoring as one would expect on Alsace. Price reflects the Michelin star.. overall an interesting journey through reinterpreted Alsatian food but not for those who want a relaxing or romantic experience.","2","","COUPLES","2018-09-30","2018-09-15","2018-09-15","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r616712451-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

Food: 3","Not a One Star Meal or Experience","Visited for lunch today.  We were excited as it is a one star Michelin rated restaurant.  Our first mistake was not realizing the restaurant considers the Friday after Ascension to also be a holiday, calling it a Holiday weekend, even though most stores and businesses treated it as a normal weekday and even the Post Office was open.  By calling it a Holiday they didn't offer the €45 lunch menu and the 3 course menu was instead €75.  While this was annoying, it wasn't enough for us to leave.  
The restaurant is in an old home and the interior was beautiful, inviting, and warm.  We both had apertifs, Picon for me and Cremánt for my wife.  For dinner I had a glass of Riesling and my wife had a Pinot Noir, both were very good. The complimentary appetizer was an asparagus reduction with the consistency of jelly and it was virtually tasteless.  We were also given brioche, which was quite good. The bread that they made for us at the hearth after showing us the dough, was burned. This didn't deter the waiter from cutting and proudly serving it to us.  My wife had a mixed local vegetable appetizer that was delicious, but unfortunately, my crab ravioli soup appetizer was very fishy tasting,  My wife's main course was essentially a boneless short rib.  Good but not great.  The hunting knife she was given was dull and the knife I was given for my fish was much better for cutting her meat.  My main course was fish with local baby vegetables and it was very good.  As a 3rd course,  my wife ordered a whipped egg white dessert with nuts and chocolate sauce.  No complaints.  My third course was an interesting and tasty combination of a caramelized sugar base, with whipped potato layer, then topped with shredded Comte cheese.  We thought the waiter asked us if my wife wanted her dessert at the same time as my cheese, but apparently he asked if she also wanted the cheese dish as they brought her one as well.  We thought they were being considerate by splitting my portion into two dishes, but that wasn't the case and we were charged an additional €18 for this dish.  My issue here is that we had each ordered the 3 course menu, so why ask us  2/3 of the way into our meal if we wanted a fourth course? We accepted responsibility for the misunderstanding and paid the bill without complaint. 
All in all, the meal was good, but certainly not great, and not to what we've come to expect from a 1 star establishment.","2","","COUPLES","2017-05-31","2017-05-26","2017-05-26","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r488003773-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

Food: 2","Way Way overrated.","The salad was excellent.  The meat dish was awful.  The meat was extremely tough and we had a hard time cutting it with the hunting knife that we were provided with. Although the juices it had been marinated in were tasty the quality of the meat was awful.  It was completely rare, but still amazingly tough.  The bread although baked once we had sat at the table and obviously totally fresh was tastless.  The concept of the dinning experience is freshness and the decor is lovely.  The freshness part is superb, but they just don't have equally high quality food.  The desert was strawberries on top of a cream with cheese mix, tasty but nothing extraordinary at all.  It's a fun place to eat, imaginative, and maybe other dishes are better.  I was disappointed.","2","","COUPLES","2017-05-31","2017-05-14","2017-05-14","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r484165562-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

Long may they run. and I adore the carrot. It's one of the signature dishes you will never forget. Go there. Enjoy!","3","","COUPLES","2016-03-31","2017-02-09","2017-02-09","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r458266842-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

I cannot say enough about this epicurean gem. As we entered the restaurant, we were met with a warm amber glow - so welcoming after the cold, bitter air of the December night.  The atmosphere / ambiance is charming - the natural wooden beams give the restaurant an inviting warmth but it is certainly not your grandmother's house:) -- the decor and tableware are somewhat eclectic and unique...definitely more trendy than traditional. The staff is extremely efficient and hospitable, and we felt relaxed and welcome from the moment we entered.  But more than that, the food was delicious and creative.  The chef/owner definitely seems to take pride in creating food that delights his customers. Every course was a treat (the homemade bread is more than delicious!!) and the wine selected by our waitress (we chose not to do a wine pairing) was perfect. The chef/owner, besides being an artist with food, was also extremely hospitable -- coordinating with a local taxi service to return us to our hotel in Strasbourg after dinner. We could not have had a more enjoyable evening. If you are touring the Alsace region - Le Bistro des Saveurs most certainly deserves a visit!","0","","NONE","2016-12-31","2017-01-23","2017-01-23","en","Thierry Schwartz - Le Restaurant","15014147","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r454354337-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html"

The food was incredibly fresh and very tasty. The service was good and professional. Good place for dinner as well as lunch if you have time.  Somehow It's pretty pricy for one star Michelin.
