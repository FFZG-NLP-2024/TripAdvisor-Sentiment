SUNday , sunny day , nice and confidential dining room , little bit too cold but the design of this area is so pretty 
We choose the 5 dishes menu 
Local suppliers , fantastic taste , the chef is an artist 
Only bad point ; service 
There is a s many staff , only few speak English and they look like lost and so stressed …weird 
But at least it was a fantastic culinary journey","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/ca/26/98/caption.jpg

Attentive and professional team, very original dishes, beef angus is excellent, melting at will. 
No False Rating, the menu changes regularly, the plates are hearty, each dish is a taste surprise.
I can't find any negatives, for me it's closer to the 18th than the 16th to the gault and Millau and the 3rd star is in sight","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/a0/33/9d/caption.jpg

After a very warm welcome, we let ourselves be guided for the gastronomic walk proposed by the chef. The dishes were both beautiful (sublime even) and delicious. Some taste associations might initially seem surprising and destabilizing, but the result on the palate has always lived up to it.
Thank you to the entire restaurant team and the chef we met at the end of the meal, for making this evening memorable.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-29","2024-08-29","en","Le Restaurant Gastronomique Christophe Dufossé","23817731","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g673651-d23817731-r967319762-Le_Restaurant_Gastronomique_Christophe_Dufosse-Busnes_Pas_de_Calais_Hauts_de_Fr.html"

Very attentive service.
The chef’s cuisine is undoubtedly refined, technical and imaginative.
However, the systematic search for multi-flavoured pairings often undermines the intrinsic taste of the excellent products used: for example, beef ripened on the oyster disappears completely under horseradish cream and langoustine in gravlax is drowned in lemon olive oil. Knives, turbot and lamb, very well worked, are certainly excellent but the quantity served for the last two is simply ridiculous (it must be 2 or 3 tens of grams at most). Finally, some combinations are perplexing such as artichoke with lamb or peas with red fruits...
The chef has obvious qualities and great dexterity but should refocus on the simplification of dishes and not excessively seek to innovate at any Award.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-08","2024-08-08","en","Le Restaurant Gastronomique Christophe Dufossé","23817731","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g673651-d23817731-r963805585-Le_Restaurant_Gastronomique_Christophe_Dufosse-Busnes_Pas_de_Calais_Hauts_de_Fr.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Not strong enough to justify the high price","Beautiful location, beautiful room surrounded by greenery, although it was still quite cold there when we entered. There is no lack of luxury and surroundings, in that respect it is certainly worth 2*, but the level does not exceed that of 1*. On the other hand, even a few mistakes that you should not encounter at that level. Both hot starters were served too cold. With the dish with Lotte, the plate was not even preheated at all, so the plate arrives lukewarm and it is actually as good as cold at the last bite... a bit disappointing that we choose 7 courses and the amuses are actually the 1st course are. We are used to something different in Belgium, maybe that still happens in France? However, this was not the case in our previous experience in France. The starter with langoustine was beautiful, beautiful and pure, but across the board the menu struggles to live up to the 16/20 from G&M (which is already a close score to achieve 2*). The main course was rabbit roulade. The garnishes were very nice but the roulade was dry and only survived with the addition of sufficient sauce, a pity...but a nice choice of cheese, both desserts were ok and above all beautifully presented. Mignardises/coffee/dessert very extensive. It was a beautiful afternoon but the kitchen should do better to charge €240 excl. drinks.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/ec/83/28/caption.jpg

The cooking, the flavors, the respect for the products, the presentation of them, the description of the dishes: it’s all there!

The (numerous) homemade breads, desserts and other sweets: everything is a pleasure!

A damper ? If you need one, it’s the price charged for drinks (tonic at €8, coffee at €11, a bottle of water at €8, glass of champagne at…€48, etc.).

The chef's visit at the end of the meal is appreciated and his explanations of his project are a delight... for your ears.

Atmosphere: 4","Good dynamic established by the chef but be careful...","Christophe Dufossé is a chef full of energy with serious motivation to strive for excellence. Obtaining the second star is proof of this.

The transition from the Meurin era has been successful, the Château de Beaulieu is resplendent. The restaurant room is very charming, but remains quite noisy with imperfect soundproofing which creates echoes. You have to speak loudly to understand each other!

The staff is completely up to the standard of the place and the cuisine. Young, dynamic, smiling and professional. We had good times of discussion, including with the Chef who visited all the tables.

We ate very well. The dressing is impeccable, the ingredients are quality. We really liked the pigeon, which was cooked perfectly. However, we didn't have a favorite dish, it was missing that little je ne sais quoi to create a particular emotion.

The responsible approach is appreciable, the establishment makes a lot of effort to source locally.

Big downside for us who are wine lovers: the prices! I had very good memories of the previous owner and his love for the divine nectars that accompany beautiful French cuisine. Many bottles here reached stratospheric prices, something I had never seen in a two Michelin star. The majority of bottles are completely inaccessible. It is understandable that the renovation work was expensive, but it is unfair to blame everything on our fine French grapes. This really took away some of the fun, unfortunately.

We wish everyone good luck, but recommend remaining vigilant on certain points...","0","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-28","2023-08-28","en","Le Restaurant Gastronomique Christophe Dufossé","23817731","https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g673651-d23817731-r913514689-Le_Restaurant_Gastronomique_Christophe_Dufosse-Busnes_Pas_de_Calais_Hauts_de_Fr.html"
