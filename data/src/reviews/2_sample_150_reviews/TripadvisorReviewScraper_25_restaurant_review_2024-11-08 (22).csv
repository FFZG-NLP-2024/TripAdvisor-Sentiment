My husband took me for lunch as a treat and it was lovely . The views are spectacular, the experience is one that makes you feel special , from the moment you turn up ( yes a bit hot and uncomfortable in a scrappy little Uber!)  to when you leave . They looked after us
The food is exciting and different. Yes there were a couple of courses I didn’t like and I must admit that I would have liked a dessert that wasn’t trying so hard to incorporate root vegetables!!! Black garlic with chocolate was a definite no for me . The staff are lovely and taking a look at the garden is well worth it . If you can afford it I would say do it .","0","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-13","2024-07-13","en","Mirazur","785504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r959315348-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

Atmosphere: 1","Brand Damaging","This is a review of Mirazur's Sydney pop-up restaurant. It was an absolute rort. Immediately below are my grievances. Below my grievances are my attempts to get in touch with the restaurant before leaving this review. It's farcical. They have been nothing short of dishonest and their behaviour, even since since dinner, has been unacceptable. I'm in touch with some of the food review journalists here (Good Food Guide) about the whole experience.

Context is that my wife and I live in Perth and travelled to Sydney for Mirazar, which is a five hour flight. We stayed in a nice hotel. The whole evening probably cost over $6k, but we were genuinely excited to try the restaurant. They charged the same, I believe, as if you were eating in Menton. The head chef did not come out, or at least he was not there the night we dined. And they were only there for about three weeks.  We previously lived in Sydney for six years (me) and 10 years (her), so understand the place.

I also mention Noma below. They did a pop up in Sydney and they did it right. Closed doors in Copenhagen, spent about three months researching the local produce and tailoring a menu, and Rene Redzepi came out for the duration. How do I know? I had a gin and tonic with him after our lunch service.

Anyway, here we go...

1) The Gantry is not a fine dining location. It’s a mid-range restaurant/hotel. If you’d have asked almost anybody in Sydney they’d have told you this. Their “water views” are of a relatively dirty stretch in between two wharves of the Hickson Road Wharves. Did Mr Colagreco ever see it? Did anybody do any due diligence?
2) Remaining with the restaurant itself and there’s honestly a pedestrian walkway going right through the dining area. It seems the hotel had maybe kept the rights to the actual waterfront tables and chairs, but we had runners passing within inches of our table. Runners! Sweaty, panting runners going right through the “world’s best restaurant”. And multiple people just out for a stroll. 
3) How many staff members did you actually bring out? We’re only confident one was from Mirazur, a lovely Italian girl serving us. But watching her prepare the butter was a joke. It was like she’d watched a YouTube video 5 minutes before. I don’t think this is a reflection on her, she seemed genuinely embarrassed, more on the last minute prep by the powers that be at the restaurant.
4) Perhaps we heard wrong, but we’re pretty sure our sommelier said he’s the hotel’s sommelier. Is that correct? You didn’t even bring out one of your sommeliers? He was lovely, but nowhere near Michelin Standard.
5) Service was chaotic. Napkins left scrumpled on tables when we went to the bathroom, chairs not pulled out or pushed in when we sat down, cutlery pretty much thrown down on tables. We’d not long been to Zen in Singapore and the contrast was extraordinary.
6) Pacing! One of our waiters, and I can’t believe he’s yours, apologised about a third of the way in. He said dishes are coming out quickly now because the kitchen is quiet, they’ll slow down as they get busier. We smiled, but are you kidding? You pace the meal based on how busy the kitchen is?
7) Produce. When Noma came out they actually spent time researching produce. You didn’t. We had to listen to a spiel about David Blackmore’s Wagyu, like you’d just found this incredible producer. Within about 5 minutes of landing in Australia in 2014 (I’m originally from UK) I’d heard of David Blackmore’s Wagyu. It’s great, but shows you did no real research. Also his current best cut is from Rubia Gallega cows from Spain. It’s actually quite an interesting story and something that would have surprised many at dinner. Pretty much everything that was mentioned we’d heard of and were familiar with.
8) There’s more, but do I need to go on? It was a nice dinner (the apple and wasabi desert was particularly good), but an embarrassment otherwise when you consider your reputation and price point.

Now for the follow up...

I emailed the above to Mirazar and guess what? Completely ignored. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt. I leave it a couple of weeks and then follow up...guess what? Ignored. I ask my wife to email them, fictitiously asking about a reservation. Immediate reply. She says thanks, would you mind now replying to my husband. Busted! They don't email, they try and call (I suspect they don't want to put anything in writing). Given the time difference we had a game of telephone tennis and then I gave up. I suggested, given that I was either in bed when they called, or they were, we discuss by email. Ignored.

So there you go. A dreadful, dishonest experience. The restaurant in Menton, I'm sure, is delightful. But the organisation behind it is money grabbing and operating with impunity. AVOID their pop ups.","0","","COUPLES","2023-06-30","2024-05-14","2024-05-14","en","Mirazur","785504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r950834086-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

This was my first dining experience at a three Michelin Star restaurant. The staff was great and friendly and the food was fantastic. The menu changes periodically based on the season and what is grown in the garden. When I was there, it was a floral season and each dish had a floral taste to it from the actual flowers that were in there garden. It is a pretty amazing thing to experience eating something that someone may never have again since the menu changes so frequently. 

The view is 10/10 and the nine courses are all very filling.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/8b/19/39/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","The Mirazur of Menton: a new era for a unique dining experience","For the night before a special lady's Big Day: we held our very own Big Night at the Mirazur and delved into one of four culinary universes by Chef Mauro Colagreco.

To mark the occasion, rather than dine with the other guests, we were beckoned through a closed glass-door and walked down the aisle between two kitchens to be seated at an exclusive table between the sea-side balcony and the Mise en Place counters: temptation was within arm's reach of this table.

We were thrilled, the ouverture of tonight’s nine-course menu was just about to be plated. The chefs operated diligently in hushed tones without heeding to our party’s seating and the beginning of the festivities. The vivid colours, odd shapes and plating already whetted our appetites. And to be seated in close proximity to such a talented ensemble was awesome.

The night in question was a “Root day” and the proposed fixed-price menu was the Root Mirazur Universe. The three other menu creations are as follows: Leaf Mirazur Universe, Flower Mirazur Universe and Fruit Mirazur Universe. The day you choose to dine at the Mirazur determines the menu’s overarching theme. The chef adheres to biodynamic principles and follows the lunar calendar to pick from his own gardens the key-ingredients of the day.

Each proposed dish of the root menu was delicious, delightful to behold and generous in portion: family style. The nine-course menu was punctuated twice by breaking bread together and even molding our butter into corrugated columns of goodness. The service was perfection: from the sommelier’s recommendations for wine and dish pairings to the last-minute menu tweaks due to food restrictions (pork and vegetarian). Every one of us felt included and cared for. Of particular note, our maître d' in dinner service made the evening that much more memorable and engaging. She was welcoming, affable and charming. Her enthusiasm at the unveiling of each course was palpable and welcome.

The experience was such a joyous occasion that my wife and I plan to return in the near future to further explore the remaining fruit, flower and leaf universes.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/99/18/af/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 4","Disappointing experience for a 3-star restaurant","We were there for dinner. Overall it was a big disappointment. This place doesn't deserve its 3 Michelin stars (maybe one) or being anywhere in the top spots of La Liste.

I'll start with the positive parts: the view of Menton is superb. Some of the dishes we had were indeed very very good (the amuse-bouche, the Salade Marine with caviar, the Epinard Malabar Gamberoni from San Remo).

However there were many issues:
- no tablecloths, shocking for the price they charge. The tables are too close to each other.
- the service was sub-par (brasserie level). They forgot to pour the wine before bringing the plates, I ordered an extra glass of wine which arrived 30' later, they were clearing the plates and cutlery from the left. Lots of personnel in the dining room but very poorly coordinated.
- my main concern, the plates became less and less enjoyable as we advanced through the menu. The aged tuna tartare with capucine could have been excellent, save that its taste was drowned by too much yuzu/ponzu spice on top. The salad with seafood sauce should not be served in any starred restaurant - just by the look of it its place is maybe in a brasserie. The lobster with marjolaine was ok but uninspiring. The hay-cooked fish with porcini could have been excellent - both the fish and the porcini shavings were superb; however, the cooked porcini was completely tasteless. The guinea fowl was bland, and it came with two ""satellite dishes"" that did not fit at all with the main dish. Finally the red cabbage-based desert was ""interesting"" but not a great way to close the dinner.
- while comprehensive, the wine list has very limited choice between EUR 100-300. Prices are up to 5x store price for the wines.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/72/47/64/caption.jpg

When we arrived they took us to our table which was located in this sort of patio in the back of the restaurant between the road and the restaurant itself. The location would not be great for a pizzeria, but was unacceptable to say the least for a 3 star restaurant: the road is very trafficked and noisy and you can literally hear every single car passing a few meters from you. The only view you have (if you are lucky) is through the glasses of the main restaurant (literally you are looking through the windows of the restaurant in front of you, filled with people that are paying the same as you but are having a “normal” dining experience and not sitting in a backyard on the road). On top of it, at some point the bar across the road started playing very loud techno music, so loud that we could barely speak and we felt like being in a club. The staff was embarrassed and mortified and said that they had never played such loud music. We decided to give our feedback to the chef (who is the owner) in a very polite way and we were surprised by his answer that “we felt that way but other people love it”. It was clear he couldn’t care less about the guests but only cared about the extra cash that the table in the terrasse was bringing him. The terrasse was half full and still we estimate the 3 tables paid more than €3000 that night, this means that with one week of revenues the restaurant would cover the costs to do the works and integrate the terrace in the restaurant. Other than that, the food was very good but not mind blowing and I found bizarre that one fo the dishes was very similar to Carlo Cracco’s goat cheese filled ravioli with mushrooms (they were even the same colour) and the Guinea fowl was also very similar to Bottura’s “non roasted Guinea fowl”. BIZARRE to say the least. The only note of excellence goes to the staff which was lovely and caring and still made sure we had an enjoyable evening.","1","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-13","2023-08-13","en","Mirazur","785504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r909945819-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

The food is hard to explain becuase it is both a work of art and a meal. Each flavor combination is carefully crafted and the presentations are, as I said, works of art. We had a lovely mix of items ranging from seafood to poultry and all sorts of things in between. If you are a wine drinker, their wine pairings are excellent as well. Everyone there is knowledgable about the food and drink options and takes the time to explain things to each guest. We've been one Michelin star restaurants before and I can see why Mirazur has three stars. If there was such a thing as more, they would earn them! If you are looking for amazing food creations, fabulous wine pairings, incredible views, and being surrounded by awesome people, this is the place to go.

We had great expectations given its rating as a world’s best restaurant.  

The restaurant was very comfortable and inviting  and the decor was aesthetically pleasing. The view was magnificent. 

The staff was attentive and accommodating. Great service. 

The food was all beautifully presented. But, in my humble opinion, most of the dishes lacked flavor.  The ingredients of the dishes did not seem to work well together. It was so disappointing from a taste perspective.  Unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants where the dishes exploded with flavor, I found that noticeably missing at Mirazur.  

I appreciate the restaurant’s commitment to aligning the menu with nature, but I wish they would have spent as much effort on making the food delicious. 

Whether eating at Mirazur is worth the price tag is a very personal decision. For me, it wasn’t and I regretted it.

The food was impeccably presented and perfectly cooked.  What elevates Miramar to another level are the quality of the wines, the sommelier was very knowledgable, and the extras - like the incredible cheese selection course.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the night we visited it was the ""leaves"" cycle and the dessert was a very disappointing dish with a strong seaweed flavor/theme on top of an Ice cream (?) that just did not work together.  The table next to us were also telling the waiter that they did not care for this dessert either although the waiter told them the kitchen would be willing to make something else.  For me, a bad dessert can put the damper on the entire meal.  This didn't do that but it was a letdown for sure.  We were unable to get an Uber back to Nice but the staff went above and beyond and secured us a coveted taxi back to Nice at the end of a long night.

Do not come if you are not open to a whole new experience in everything!! You will be miserable otherwise. Every single detail of our experience was carefully thought through, and well executed. The theme was flowers- the colours, artistry and creativity of each dish was incredible and much appreciated. The taste of the dishes was a different matter! Some combinations worked, many did not. I was very excited with the surprise presented with each course. Enjoyed many new discoveries - like the Yucca flower stuffed with crabmeat and almond foam, osmantus flower from Asia, cooked with langoustine- delicate and delicious! Loved the lobster skewered in a vanilla stick with celeriac, in a basket of flowers. The artichoke tart with truffles was delicious. The main dish of pigeon cooked very rare, presented with it’s  blood red colour upset me very much- I could hardly bring myself to eat it that rare. All the desserts were pretty to look at, but difficult to enjoy eating. It finished the meal badly for me. My husband was very unhappy with the meal- he found much of the tastes unacceptable. He wanted to leave as soon as dessert was served as he was in a bad mood. When we found our car positioned and ready to be driven away, we were most impressed by the thoughtfulness. 
Service was very attentive and different stewards came with a dish to tell us the story of that dish. All members of their team were well trained and articulate, polished n polite n pleasant.
