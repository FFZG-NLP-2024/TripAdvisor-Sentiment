It did not disappoint. The setting is absolutely stunning—a beautiful house with a charming garden that complements the concept perfectly.

The service was impeccable: attentive, friendly, and passionate. Special thanks to Tony, who took wonderful care of us throughout the evening. We made a last-minute switch to the Chef's Table experience, enjoying a 16-course meal with wine pairing, and it was an unforgettable experience. Each dish was a masterpiece, with complex, well-balanced flavors that highlighted herbs from their garden. There wasn’t a single dish we didn’t love.

If I could offer one suggestion, it would be to feature only Greek wines in the pairing. Greece has such a rich variety, and it would be wonderful to showcase the treasures of this country even more fully.

Overall, Soil is definitely worth the visit!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","Soil Restaurant","23750939","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r974810267-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html"

The restaurant is located in a very pleasant house, with indoor and outdoor tables. As soon as you enter, you are introduced to the kitchen and the team that prepares the excellent dishes. The idea, explained in a booklet on the table, is to use fresh ingredients, grown in the garden! And with that, the dishes are surprising!

Gorgeous garden.","The only reason this restaurant is not three stars is because it is not in France. There is a lot of farm-to table talk in the restaurant business, but there are very few that take it to the level that this restaurant does. The concept is intelligent and the food is not overly “worked” in the sense that there is a genuine effort to highlight the specific tastes that each particular dish is highlighting. There is no molecular cooking or foam for which I am extremely grateful. 14 small dishes do take time. but the service was excellent, (although we had a little bit of trouble getting the bill at the end)! On value for money, Compared to one star, let alone two star restaurants in France, this restaurant is worth the trip to Athens.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/5e/59/36/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Wonderful food - Exceptional experience","Conceptually, Soil is a fantastic restaurant nailing the brief when it comes to farm to table and representing authentic Greek food. There is a warmth throughout which came in lots of ways; walking past the kitchen and meeting the brigades on the way to being seated, the booklet of herbs grown in the garden and the personalised menu to take home with a bunch of herbs. All of these things elevate the experience but ultimately, the food has to deliver - to that extent, it did! The taster menu was as clever as it was enjoyable to eat! 
The Lobster and amberjack were particular highs with a mention going to the caramel dish too! 
The food and execution of concept with the overall experience points this to targeting two stars justifiably.
Service needs to tighten up though. A few times the wine and water glasses were empty - not the end of the world for an average establishment but as the kitchen set such high standards, similar was expected of the waiting team.
I look forward to visiting again and thoroughly recommend!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/53/94/38/caption.jpg

We visited Soil as we were in Athens celebrating a big birthday and thought we’d try something with a good ethos and go the whole hog with the wine pairing as well. On first impressions we were a bit surprised by the atmosphere. Whilst the staff were really nice it just felt a bit stifled and perfunctory. We’ve become accustomed to a more relaxed Michelin experience as times have moved on from the starched white linen and table scrapers, and whilst there wasn’t a scraper in sight, the service itself felt the same which was a strange juxtaposition. We were a late sitting and were whizzed through 14 canapé sized bites. It was a bit of a whirlwind so was probably lucky the wine pairing had such small tastings. Apart from some of them, we weren’t sure the pairings lent themselves well to the food or vice versa. The majority of dishes also had high levels of acidity, which for us led to that being the dominating flavour profile. In the bread course, we had one with the provided acidity and one without, and the one without was outstanding. I have to say that the pre dessert and dessert was phenomenal and will be a dessert I remember for a long time. I can’t say the food isn’t good, because it is, but maybe it’s just that it’s something we’ve had before and not necessarily new; apart from the vinegar that is but that’s just not for us. We don’t regret going, and people should go and make up their own minds, but we have been to places without stars where the flavours and experience maybe trump it.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-16","2024-03-16","en","Soil Restaurant","23750939","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r942489601-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html"

The autumn menu was delightfully balanced, well paced and enthusiastically presented. Recommend the premium wine paring. On this visit, the lobster, caviar and A5 wagyu supplements were sublime.

Overall vibes were unfussy, uncomplicated and very much a team effort - where no one person seemed to want to be the star. Looking back on notes from the evening, this passage from Emerson comes to mind:

“Let the stoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is keen.”

Athens has some very fine places to dine. Soli is the place to go to if you want great food and warm hospitality to be at the center of your experience.","16","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/5f/c8/2c/caption.jpg

There was more assurance in the preparation of the dishes (we loved the tartare and the goat with white truffle was exquisite) , the ingredients were as always top quality and cooked to perfection, and the team was now more unified and relaxed — we welcomed the new sommelier who was knowledgeable without being pretentious: we chose the vintage pairing and tried some intriguing wines, it was stimulating to taste something unknown such as the Blanc de blanc by Ott or a grüner Veltliner who’s producer I can’t recall, while the homemade amaro was an interesting surprise. We felt cherished customers which gave us much pleasure and created a warm ambience. The setting is sober without unnecessary glitz, and the bouquet that rested on our napkin filled our evening with woodland perfumes. Because it offers a holistic experience, Soil is by far my favourite restaurant in Athens.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/0e/6b/04/caption.jpg

To our surprise, it's housed in an old house (we felt like we were visiting our grandmother's house). The space didn't impress us at all due to its age, quite the opposite actually. However, the team consists of young and polite individuals, and the service is exceptional.
 The 14-course degustation menu is interesting, but as I mentioned, it doesn't fit well in this setting. There are also many additional extras if you'd like, such as a bite of lobster (+45 euros), caviar (+20), white truffle (+32), or Wagyu A5 (+36 euros). Furthermore, the wine list is quite overpriced. There is a balcony at the back of the house where we discovered a garden on two levels with trees and flowers; this was a plus for the old house. I won't visit again due to the ambiance. Since this team deserves something better, I suggest relocating to a more iconic space. Happy holidays.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2023-12-02","2023-12-02","en","Soil Restaurant","23750939","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r928137345-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html"

Service was attentive and professional. Atmosphere and design as well pretty nice.

Prices for sparkling wine and corresponding wine pairing on the other hand are a rip-off. Charging 20 EUR for a glass of Karanika which can be bought for 18 EUR a bottle in a shop is not acceptable. You are getting glasses of champagne in other restaurants for this price. The so called premium wine pairing for 135 EUR each person has been underwhelming.  Not a single bottle of these wines is charged more than 20 EUR in a shop. In total you are getting eight small glasses which adds up to one bottle of wine. Pricing for wines is unfortunately unbearable in this restaurant.","1","","COUPLES","2023-11-30","2023-11-02","2023-11-02","en","Soil Restaurant","23750939","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r924087710-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html"

Honestly every course was amazing but I think the cod was our favorite. We did wine pairing as well and got to try a lot of interesting wines. When I said I didn’t like the one they were nice enough to replace it with something else. They also paced the meal based on what we were doing not just a standard which I think speaks highly of the staff and bring attentive. We are fast eaters and caught up to a few table around us during the course of the meal. Took pix of all the courses but don’t want to ruin the surprise so only attaching 2 of them.

The restaurant sent us a message around midday, so we had plenty of notice. It also meant that we were unable to eat in the garden, which was a shame, but again, this was beyond anyone's control.
On arrival, the welcome felt very rushed: The ""meet the chef"" experience was limited to a quick ""hello"" to (obviously) very busy staff in the kitchen, before we were hurried up the stairs (my wife struggling to keep up in her heels) whilst we were given an extremely brief explanation of the history of the building and the philosophy of the restaurant. It was all a bit of a blur really, and didn't add to the experience at all, making us slightly uncomfortable from the off, and perhaps it would have been better to have seated us first.The restaurant interior is very handsome (split into several separate dining rooms), with high ceilings, wooden floors and minimalist but tasteful decoration. It does perhaps lack the atmosphere of eating in the garden, however.
The service we received was very professional, as one would expect, but seemed to lack a genuine warmth. The food was generally excellent, and presented superbly, and we enjoyed every dish with the exception of the eel, which my wife did not like, but I was happy to finish hers. For us, the standout dishes were the oyster and the goat. The only criticism I would make, is that the bread course is served halfway through the meal. We would have preferred it at the start, and used it to mop up the juices from the dishes where necessary, particularly when many were served in ridged dishes, making it practically impossible to spoon up the remainders. I am not too proud to pick up and slurp, however. We chose a reasonably-priced bottle of white (the menu was weighted towards fish and seafood) from the wine list, rather than taking one of the wine pairing options. 
In summary, it was a very nice special evening out on the last night of our trip, and was good value for money, but perhaps lacked a little something to make it a truly memorable one.
