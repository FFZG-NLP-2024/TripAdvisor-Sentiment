Food: 5","Second time and just as outstanding as the first!","
This is now the second time we have been to Delta and both experiences have been outstanding.  

Last summer, we visited the restaurant shortly after they first opened and before their Michelin two-star rating, but even then, you could easily understand that they were destined for greatness.  

When we went back last week, it was nice to see that the staff remembered us from almost exactly a year ago.  While there was one similar dish from the year before, every new addition to their repertoire was surprising, flawlessly presented and perfectly executed.  Another reviewer said it perfectly that “this is not only a restaurant; it’s a full experience” and it is an experience that should not be missed if you can manage it. 

Well done, “Delta”.  We will definitely be back again next summer and regardless of whether or not you achieve the third star, you will always have it in our minds.

Food: 5","Great experience but could be better","The setting is modern and elegant.  The service was impeccable.  The commitment to sustainability is beyond admirable, and the presentation of each course is truly phenomenal and without equal.  At the end of the evening, however, I felt that maybe the taste of the food was at times secondary to its appearance.  I am not trying to be overly critical, as most of the courses were excellent, but the ""early spring insect of lobster"" in the form of a bumblebee and the ""edible butterfly"" of chilled aerated beeswax cream and other ingredients are examples of too much focus on presentation and not enough on taste.  Neither dish was particularly great, while the pluma iberico course, which was plated in a straightforward manner, was fantastic.  The overall experience was certainly worthy of 2 Michelin stars.","3","","SOLO","2023-05-31","2023-07-09","2023-07-09","en","Delta","18820451","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r901816257-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html"

It’s definitely different from a lot of other starred restaurants in the sense that each dish of the 12-courses menu has a history in itself and it goes way beyond the simple tasting experience.
It’s just pure magic! We enjoyed everything, from the appetizers to the dessert.
What can be improved though is the service: in a 2-stars restaurant you expect definitely more attention to the guest (from the type of water You drink to the kindness of waiters)…definitely what you do not expect is having a waitress telling you that you cannot go to the restroom if then the next course comes 15 minutes later!…
But again, the food is worth the whole experience!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/a5/08/cc/caption.jpg

Food: 1","Not worth it at all","We went with a lot of expectations since it’s a 2 Michelin ⭐️ restaurant however, we were very disappointed with the limited menu curated even after giving our preferences.. Restaurant doesn’t specify anywhere that they are only a pescatarian restaurant on google, in case you do not eat beef or pork and they lack any respect for chicken or lamb as a meal to be served to those who do not eat beef or pork.. They expect them to be ‘Okay’ with their seafood menu which is not very appetising… The next best option was mushrooms which was extremely tangy and lacked flavour… I personally found it very disappointing because they couldn’t even cover up with some amazing desserts at the end that one would expect at such a highly rated restaurant.. Extremely average desserts after a disappointing meal.. 

Fine crockery, great service as expected and possibly the only thing they have worked on.. The view from the tables  was nice and the ambiance was good too but it lacked good food which we went for.. Go at your own risk because no matter if you like the food or not, the manager has a good excuse for everything.. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/7a/18/d9/caption.jpg

Food: 1","why  the bad review?","after visiting Geranium we were really excited to try delta - as one of the chefs was assistant Head Chef there. the restaurant design was amazing - we were seated in front the window that overlooked the marine. the service was attentive and the dishes were unique in flavor.   so why the bad review? i belive that a 2 star MICHELIN  restaurant isn't just about good food but also the 360° experience - something phenomenal  that goes with you days later - this restaurant disappointed in that aspect. 
as i do not eat pork i was served Turbot kissed by the fire and served with a sauce of seasonal offerings and my companions got the Pluma iberico seasoned . after 20 mins i told my husband that i have Heartburn. 10 min later i started to fell nausea and blamed it on fatigue and asked for tea. after 50 min from eating the  Turbot  i was trying not to throw up in the restaurant. came back to the hotel and as i laughingly said to my husband the next morning - ""i throw away 200 EURO to the toilet"". 
it was a horrible night.   
for concern to other guests and for the name of the restaurant i sent them  an email stating that i was not writing for a refund just for there knowledge as i was the only one that was so sick. 

no email. no phone call - no nothing from them. not even how I'm feeling.
waited a week an wrote this review. 

so if you want to go to a restaurant that looks at you as as walking EURO and not as customer or a guest - enjoy. 
i didn't. ","8","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/c2/ec/6f/caption.jpg

Being a refined hospitality professional with a culinary experience of over 20 years dining at top restaurants in this planet I can only say that it is a WOW. 

The culinary journey was sensational and their focus and vision behind the journey is speechless. Each dish was unique and extraordinary and we had a premium wine pairing which is a perfect match for this exceptional gastronomy.

Service is outstanding and very personalised and ambience is very modern and elegant.

Overall my experience is a WOW.

The setting is stunning. A lot of space, high ceilings, trees floating in the air, an excellent view.
The music, as in most reataurants, was (slightly) too loud, so that I didn‘t understand everything our waiter explained to us.
Service was excellent in the beginning.
The food was interesting and tasty, but the initial courses were too small. One course was literally just one little mushroom.

In the end, they dropped the ball completely. After the last course was served, they just forgot us. We had to ask multiple times for the bill. When we left, nobody said goodbye or even looked at us. Yes, the restaurant was full. But I simply expect more from a 2-star Michelin restaurant. For what we paid, I was disappointed. Price/value ratio is not good here. It also didn‘t help that there was a baby that made noise druing the whole evening. A restaurant like this should outright forbid the presence of small children.

Overall, disappointed not just with this restaurant, but with Michelin as well.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/b0/f2/9d/caption.jpg

The chef came from Geranium in Denmark, and there is for sure a link to the food and the servings, which is a good thing

I have never experienced so decorative settings and presentation of the food. The tastes were at a very high level, good use of savory and umami, the sizes just spot on

The presentation was the best ever seen, and taste top level

The wine menu was again very balanced to the food, ex excellent choice, and glad it included Greek wine as well, after all am in Greece 

The staff were extremely service minded, well coordinated and it was a joy to see them operate together

Few small mishaps

Served food once while wine was presented

A little topping on the wine during the breaks, sat with water

Had to ask to order coffee, after a too long wait,, 

Small mistakes that indicates that not yet three stars, but very very close

Our experience from other 2-Michelin-stars restaurants made us hope for a memorable evening, yet tastewise there was something not right. Although visually the dishes—also the tableware—were stunning, they let us down. Many of them were often unfamiliarly sweet — we didn’t like, for instance, lobster with lotus fruit. There was seafood with strawberries and fish with prunes; are we traditionalists? Maybe. Yet we enjoy enormously Asian or fusion food. The menu was unbalanced: a long series of dishes based on seafood and fish, then suddenly only one with meat (Iberico) and then all of a sudden three deserts together. The wine served was also disappointing, there were some biodynamic wines who are not to everybody’s liking, although the pairing was good. Also, wine pairing started after the hors d’œuvres which means that one has to take an aperitif (we did), otherwise there is nothing there. The team that served us was impeccable, very professional and at the same time not pretentious and friendly. Our sommelier was a pleasure to listen to. One last thing: for my partner who hates fingerfood, there was a problem; a large part of the menu is to be eaten with the fingers. This restaurant has the potential to become better; we all know that Michelin stars are not everything, especially if other factors, such as service and aesthetics, contribute to their attribution.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/26/c7/1e/79/caption.jpg

Delta is a World Class Dining Experience That Should Not Be Missed","Friends suggested we visit “Delta” and although I was resistant, simply because I can be a picky eater, I must say that the dinner was outstanding, and the entire experience was absolutely perfect.
 
Although we had been to the Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center a few times in the past and have always loved it, this time was very different because we capped off the visit with an incredible, 13 course meal from two world class chefs and a staff that was equally trained to ensure that their guests left completely satisfied and with huge smiles. 

Athens certainly has several world restaurants, some with Michelin stars, but this is without a doubt, my favorite. Delta is unique for sure. Each dish was a wonderful surprise of flavors, presentation, artistry, and they all perfectly test and satisfy your senses.
 
I could describe the dishes we had, but I believe that would destroy the experience of going because not knowing in advance and allowing these master chefs to surprise you with every plate is all part its intrigue. 

Special thanks to the team that made our meal absolutely memorable in the very best of ways and for being able to keep a restless person like me not just engaged, but actually wanting more after each turn along their wonderful culinary journey. 

One piece of advice though is to book the 17-course option instead of the 13 we had. We knew instantly, that the 13 course was a mistake and that we would be wanting and in fact, needing more. Because the restaurant is conscious of waste and sustainability, upgrading to the 17-course meal during your visit is impossible. However, we now know, and we will most certainly return and do it even better the next time around. 

BRAVO, DELTA!!  We will see you again and we will definitely recommend you to everyone as you most certainly earned that and more.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/79/5c/b8/delta.jpg
