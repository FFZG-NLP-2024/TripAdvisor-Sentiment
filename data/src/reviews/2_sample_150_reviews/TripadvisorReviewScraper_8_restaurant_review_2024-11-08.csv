Atmosphere: 5","Now part of my annual Shanghai itinerary","Clearly a world class restaurant - providing a break from the many excellent Chinese restaurants in town. The team still sources many great ingredients (say sea urchin) from China, but the cuisine is modern global - dishes had elements from Indian, Thai, German and other cuisines but it all came together very well.

The setting creates a great atmosphere with a table built around the kitchen. Particularly for a solo diner you can be well entertained by staff and other diners. 

Great experience - will definitely be back.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-09-13","2024-09-13","en","Taian Table","15698065","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g308272-d15698065-r969617695-Taian_Table-Shanghai.html"

On the other, the waitress is good and the chef or people working at the kitchen is excellent as well, but the waiter is a little bit rude, because when I ask can I change my seat they directly answer me such as NO,emmm they should say I deeply understand the reason you want to change the seat, but unfortunately, it has been done at the moment and the new lamp is on the way,because we ordered it a few days ago,but next time when you come I will arrange a best seat for you. Don’t worry anything, you have my word.

The menu is degustation and you can select 10 or 12 courses. Every course is very good to excellent. Food is pan european, the new german-dutch chef just arrived 6 months ago

Service is excellent as well

U-shaped open kitchen concept and the chef is very interactive, which just adds points","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/d5/a3/92/caption.jpg

Taste and delivery of the food is impeccable, flavors were bold and well balanced in every dish. We celebrated our anniversary here and were fantastic with some of the prearrangements. It’s the small things that end up being most memorable and it was all genuinely a good time.

Well deserved 2 Michelin stars and highly recommended. If it’s your first time, would recommend the 14 course to taste some of those great classics. Will be coming back to the new Menus. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/d4/f3/89/photo2jpg.jpg

The layout is modern and sophisticated with bar seating surrounding the kitchen, enabling diners to view the cooking and plating process prior to service. There is also booth seating for larger groups. The menu is complex and modern, and changes every couple of months to match availability of fresh ingredients. We had the 14 course tasting menu, which was superb in every way. Of all the many restaurants I have been to in Shanghai, this is by far the best. Highly recommended!!!","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/eb/60/76/beetroot.jpg
