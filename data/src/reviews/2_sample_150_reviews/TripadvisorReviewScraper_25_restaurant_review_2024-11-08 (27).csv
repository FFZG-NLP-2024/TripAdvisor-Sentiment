The food on the whole was excellent.  Particularly liked were the Alpine caviar, the ""old dairy cow"" and the BBQ quail.  Probably the least liked was the wood sorel desert.  I had the non-alcoholic pairing, and some were better than others.  The kambucha was excellent, and my wife really like the cherry juice.  Being able to watch the large kitchen staff at work was a pleasure and the wait staff of course very attentive.  It was an interesting experience but an expensive one.","1","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-09-04","2024-09-03","en","Sven Wassmer Memories","19003653","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g198797-d19003653-r968220763-Sven_Wassmer_Memories-Bad_Ragaz_Canton_of_St_Gallen.html"

At the moment only hotel guests can book with the restaurant and the public outside cannot due to COVID. So it was easier to book but still we had to wait for a few days. 
We didn’t know what to expect but had heard so many positive reviews. 
We were not disappointed. It was amazing. The food was so flavourful and Chef Sven Wassmer allows the ingredients to shine. Who knew the plain potato could taste so good. We also chose to do the wine pairings and the wine chosen complimented each dish and added an extra complexity to the dishes. The sauces which included ingredients like pine oil tasted and smelt amazing and I made sure I scraped the dishes clean, not to leave any sauce behind. 
The staff are so knowledgeable and friendly and surprised us with a little cake as we were celebrating my husband’s birthday. 
I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant and would suggest that you allow yourself to be open to go on this food/wine journey. The menu journey through ‘winter in the alps’ was brilliant. I look forward to sampling the other seasonal menu journeys in the future. 
My husband and I want to be back in September to try their new menu and also to enjoy the outdoors of the Grand Resort Hotel. 
We definitely have pleasurable ‘memories’ of our experience and look forward to coming back to make more ‘memories’. 
Sincerely, 
Tash & Paul ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1c/7b/2e/5b/photo0jpg.jpg

I went for the 12 course meal with wine pairing and didn't regret it. The staff were all so passionate about their jobs and had a story for each course. Every bite was well thought out and lovingly made. From clover, to fir, cheese water (cheese with no protein but all of the taste), char, venison, pulled pork and so much more. Sourced from almost exclusively local producers, this meal satisfied and surprised me. The bread was so lovely, with a crunchy exterior and perfectly soft inside. I could see the baker had carefully prepared his starter and experimented with various flours until he found the perfectly milled version. I had to hold myself back from eating it all for fear of filling myself too much to be able to finish the meal.
Taking my tastebuds on a tour of the local farms with all of their innovative ideas and respect for traditional methods, I made my way through dish after dish. Each as spectacular as the last. In between dishes I could smell the smells of various things being prepared and it got me excited for what was coming next. The wine pairings complemented the food so well and were a show of their own. Finally the decor was lovely, providing warmth, class and privacy as I enjoyed my meal. Even the logo with its Swiss mountain M and moon O were cleverly incorporated. I will definitely be back!! Thank you to everyone on the team for sharing their amazing talents! I appreciate your hard work and dedication to your craft and it really shows.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/ed/26/8b/20200215-191538-largejpg.jpg

It can be understood, but when you choose the most expensive menu with the wine pairing to compensate, it is still a bit unpleasant...
An 11-course menu, the first 3 of which were too salty, for my taste. The other 8 were correct. Lots of blabber. Nice and efficient service. Perfect sommelier.
Pension and restaurant lost two guests, but they probably don’t care. And even if we do you a ""favor"", charging you only 130 CHF in the end, the damage is done.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-08-28","2024-08-28","en","Sven Wassmer Memories","19003653","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g198797-d19003653-r967250894-Sven_Wassmer_Memories-Bad_Ragaz_Canton_of_St_Gallen.html"

Service was more extensive in the description of the food and the casual Heidi approach does not compare to the classic service of a les trois rois.
The food is very good and is enriched with hay flour or pine cone tip; original and timely mentally close to nature. But never comes close to a “damnable” foie gras.
All four of us had chosen a 7 course run and even towards the end we did not want an extension of two courses (cheese). Brought and settled 9 courses ! 
Apart from that, the prices are absolutely fine given the very good quality and staff-intensive service.","1","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-08-11","2024-08-11","en","Sven Wassmer Memories","19003653","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g198797-d19003653-r964269494-Sven_Wassmer_Memories-Bad_Ragaz_Canton_of_St_Gallen.html"

From the very beginning, the service was courteous and very attentive. 

A lot has been written about the restaurant by many people. Some people talk about ""food from the gods"", others about ""out of this world"". Some agree that this is a real treat and will be etched in one's memory. And so do we.

It is always a real pleasure to be here. The snacks get you in the mood for the evening. The menu varies depending on the season, but certain ""classics"" are always on it. This was also the case with our visit with the char and the ""Knöpfli"". Here you really want to take your plate to the kitchen and ask for a second helping. But you would also like to have more of the mashed potatoes with the old cow despite or precisely because of all the butter.

We can only recommend everyone to eat here on a special day, for example. It is an absolute delight. 
Many thanks to the whole team who made the evening an unforgettable one for us and our friends.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/9a/c9/1c/caption.jpg

He seems to be a chef who stays away from gimmicks and technical tricks and tries to win over the guest with a unique approach that is difficult to put into words. What seems so pleasantly sparse and uncomplicated on the plate is actually full of intricate details that create deep and balanced flavors. The high-quality ingredients that he certainly uses reflect a close affinity with Switzerland. Bold and full of contrast, honest and accessible - this is the kind of food you would like to come across more often! Just think of being served something as crude as Kässpätzle in a three-star restaurant, but then being served something that suddenly takes the rug from under your feet and that you will remember for the rest of your life!","1","","COUPLES","2023-04-30","2024-02-29","2024-02-29","en","Sven Wassmer Memories","19003653","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g198797-d19003653-r940193690-Sven_Wassmer_Memories-Bad_Ragaz_Canton_of_St_Gallen.html"
