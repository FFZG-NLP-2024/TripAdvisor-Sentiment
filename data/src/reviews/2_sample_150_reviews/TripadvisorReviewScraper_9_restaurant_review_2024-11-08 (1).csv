Chef‘s use of plants from the kitchen gardens and the local area is innovative and very tasty. 

The menu was easily adapted to one of us being pescatarian. 

The amuse bouches through each of the nine courses were excellent. 

Very innovative and surprising use of edible flowers, which both the chef and the owner clearly have a passion for. 

There is a clear objective to serve dishes that you won‘t find elsewhere - to stand out. 

The wine pairing, representing smaller Swiss suppliers, was also very good. 

The restaurant has a stunning view of the valley and surrounding mountains.

The decor is very typical Swiss chalet, with some quirky twists, and is cosy. 

Service is friendly and efficient. 

Highly recommend, and would definitely dine here again.","0","","COUPLES","2023-06-30","2023-06-16","2023-06-16","en","Regina Montium","13800823","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580347-d13800823-r895403976-Regina_Montium-Rigi_Kaltbad.html"

Welcome at reception was very warm.

We had a Superior Holzclasse room, with a breathtaking view of the valley. Spacious, well decorated, with an extremely comfortable bed. Room and bathroom were spotless. 

Fabulous to be up in the fresh mountain air in this charming hotel.

All staff were welcoming and helpful.

Highly recommend, and would stay again.","0","","COUPLES","2023-06-30","2023-06-16","2023-06-16","en","Regina Montium","13800823","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580347-d13800823-r895402733-Regina_Montium-Rigi_Kaltbad.html"

Since this restaurant is close to the cable car down, we decided to try it. What a pleasant surprise!  The food was very good with large quantities. We enjoyed “lighter” entrees such as the salad with fish, but also splurged on the sausages. The service was great, the views were probably great - we happened to be inside a cloud - and the restaurant is charming. Very nice lunch!","0","","FAMILY","2023-05-31","2023-05-19","2023-05-19","en","Regina Montium","13800823","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580347-d13800823-r891053148-Regina_Montium-Rigi_Kaltbad.html"

Both meals were highly impressive and memorable. The local ingredients were a highlight, but so too the rustic decor, excellent and knowledgeable service, beautiful presentation and preparation (a real feast for the eyes and mind) and a good selection of Swiss wines. Definitely on the return list. This restaurant easily deserves its star.","4","","FAMILY","2018-10-31","2018-10-16","2018-10-16","en","Regina Montium","13800823","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g580347-d13800823-r625338944-Regina_Montium-Rigi_Kaltbad.html"

A special mention for the accompaniment - soft drinks, elaborated by the ""druids"" home! It is well worth trying!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/b7/17/87/caption.jpg

We enjoyed the nine-course menu and every single course was a new highlight, simply sensational. In the main course you could even order a bit more, and since it was so delicious, I also made use of it.
In addition to the excellent food, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Every wish was met.
