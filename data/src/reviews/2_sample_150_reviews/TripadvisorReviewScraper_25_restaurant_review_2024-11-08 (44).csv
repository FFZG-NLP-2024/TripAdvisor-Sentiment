Each dish was fresh and appealing.  The hotel director at the Drei Raben where we stayed discovered we were dining at Essigbratlein and he was extremely enthusiastic telling us how the vegetables would “explode” with deliciousness and exquisite flavors.   He was totally accurate!  This restaurant was one of the highlights of our dining experiences on a long road trip through Austria and Germany.  It would be our top pick to return and experience again.  The wine pairing was also wonderful and my partner who doesn’t care for alcohol loved the non-alcoholic beverage pairing.  I believe our dining experience lasted about 4 hours and we loved every minute.  Vielen Dank!  Bravo to the chefs and entire staff!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/08/6a/ca/caption.jpg

Both meals were amazing but what really impressed me the creativity about developing vegetable based dishes. Fortunately, not overly deconstructed, but bringing out the essence of very simple veggies. 

Atmosphere and service is wonderful as well, so is the wine list.

Absolutely worth a very long journey.","0","","SOLO","2023-08-31","2023-08-10","2023-08-09","en","Essigbrätlein","958191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r909216722-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

Food: 5","For the best experience and memory of any meal in Germany!","In Nuremberg on business and decided to go all-in for the best possible dinner experience.  If you have dined somewhere like Alinea (Chicago, IL), you know what fine dining can be -- Essigbraetien has earned its stars and deserves three!  From the moment you enter, you are treated as the only guests.  Trust the front of house and the kitchen staff to leave you feeling ""blown away"".

If you are an enophile, definitely include the wine pairing - selections from their cellar are perfectly matched with each course - and you will not find these wines in a retail store.

Very intimate setting but still appropriate for a business dinner for two.  Worth every euro and every moment spent dining with this team!  Frankly, this restaurant is the one reason to travel to Germany!

To the restaurant - please forgive that my review is in English.  But, language was no barrier to an amazing evening.  Many many thanks.","2","","NONE","2021-11-30","2021-12-15","2021-12-15","en","Essigbrätlein","958191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r822090783-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

The meal was truly an experience where each dish was interesting and unique in its own way. We have been to two 1 Michelin star restaurants in the past, but this was our first 2 Michelin star restaurant and it did not disappoint. Many of the dishes are vegetarian, but they are just as delicious as the meat dishes. There was also an optional wine pairing for each course if you wish. We were served 13 courses, including the amuse bouches that preceded the main courses. Everything was great, highly recommend if you are in Nuremberg!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6f/08/b6/green-vegetables.jpg

Each dish of the many courses was described in detail as it was delivered to us. If this all sounds amazing it was, and very upscale with prices to match.
The wines were also high calibre and interesting. 
Each course, the five main ones and the many tasters in between were all very different multi layer flavour sensations.
Each one was a new experience for our palates to, sometimes quite slowly, unravel and eventually enjoy. 
In summary expect the unexpected and we hope you will enjoy the experience as much as we did.","2","","BUSINESS","2019-11-30","2019-12-01","2019-12-01","en","Essigbrätlein","958191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r730026029-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

However, if you enjoy a diverse meal this should be a must. Don’t expect inexpensive if you’re eating at a Michelin starred restaurant, expect quality.  That’s what you’ll receive here, quality.

I value the food that I tasted as one of the best culinary experiences.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/1b/93/b7/img-20181011-121022-largejpg.jpg

I didn't know this restaurant is famous for vegetables food when food came out.

the restaurant provided food course which are different everyday maybe. 

the restaurant interior was antique and nice, the sommelier and chef gave us extremly good services. Ex) Whenever foods came out, chef examine the foods individually and sommelier recommended wines(we didn't take a wine).

However unfortunately, it had no air-conditioner. through the opened windows, some bees and flies irritated us to take dinner.
and we dont like vegetable, so we didn't taste the food. just enjoy seeing the wonderful foods.
meat was just one in all food and the price is a little high to us.

consequently, I recommend this restaurant to vegetarians and those who wanna take special and newly taste.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/2f/67/54/essigbraetlein.jpg

I personally adore vegetables and bland food. My partner is a vegetarian. We both eat tiny portions, but I felt like I've been given literally one slice of leek over the whole evening. Luckily I went for the 7 course menu that included a hip of lamb, so I wasn't going home completely starved as my girlfriend did who went for the 4 course meal instead. I wasn't asked how I like the meat, it was bloody medium rare. It was tender but nothing spectacular. Just a good piece of lamb, chewy tho and hard to cut without a steak knife. It was still the highlight of my dinner that gave me some filling satisfaction. We both love healthy, regional organic food- but the price is just ridiculously high for what it is-  Poor people food (leeks, celery, onion)  Delicious, but for that price I'm expecting lobster, Beluga Caviar,  Wagyu Beef and Champagne. We payed 400 Dollar for 2, only had 2 regional glasses of wine and came home hungry. Yes, the dishes were super cute presented in extremely tiny portions and beautifully arranged but nothing spectacular out of this world that's new or not seen before. 
The windows were open the whole evening, attracting lots of flies into the glasses of water and wine. Maybe a net over the open window would be useful. We give the one star for the excellent service, that was really spectacular. You can tell the servants are highly trained and skilled. The door was held open, the napkin was replaced when falling on the floor immediately and the staff spoke perfect English. It was also great to see the chef comming to the tables. We only give one star in total because the price in comparison to what is offered is really not appropriate. Complimentary choclate chunks are given at the end which is really nice, but now I feel a bit sick eating all of them because of the hunger, smaller choclate would match the tiny menu.
A note about holding a conversation down in this small formal room would be good with the mostly American visitors that evening talking  so loudly we knew all about their private business at the end of the evening. My partner is American and felt offended by their loud conversations. We missed some kind of gentle music. Unfortunately live music in not cherished anywhere when it gives such a great atmosphere. We expected to be blown away but we are quite surprised of what people think is unique and out of this world.....To us it's everyday healthy food that should be served in bigger portion for cheaper. We would be eating there daily. But with literally one leek on the plate you can't go home satisfied. We haven't regret going there tho, we had a great evening. We would not go back. Thank you for the great attentive and professional table service.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/a3/12/dd/essigbraetlein.jpg

Possibly rather more quaint than other starred restaurants we had visited, from ringing the bell to enter to the internal décor.
As one would expect, service was impeccable but pleasantly jovial. Now for the difference, that lies in the unusual style of food, from the many amuse bouches to the clever and possibly unique use of vegetables. The menu I shall be posting with this review has lost a great deal in translation and is over simplified beyond belief.
As always, we chose to drink the paired wines and had the privilege of tasting some superb well matched wines with our unusual meal.
Overall, it was a very pleasant meal in a quaint restaurant, but would we go again, probably not.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/78/b7/4e/lamb-with-beans.jpg

The dining room was warm and cozy.  Service was below average for this type of restaurant.  I one point it seemed like we waited an eternity between to courses.  The wait staff offered no explanation or apology.  I thought the value was not there and would not go back.","1","","COUPLES","2017-10-31","2017-12-02","2017-12-01","en","Essigbrätlein","958191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r544536908-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"

Dessert - fabulous. The extra chocolate course was a delicious and welcome surprise.  the atmosphere is a bit stuffy but for an intimate romantic (somewhat expensive) meal, I say yes, go.  I would call this more a 1 Michelin star restaurant, instead of 2 stars. I'm not rushing to go back, but I know two friends who are.","1","","COUPLES","2017-03-31","2017-08-07","2017-08-07","en","Essigbrätlein","958191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r509621277-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html"
