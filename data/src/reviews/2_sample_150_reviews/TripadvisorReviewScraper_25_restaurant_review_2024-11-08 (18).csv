It did not disappoint but it was not without its quirks.  

The atmosphere was great - a pleasant buzz, friendly staff and good table spacing. 

The food was at points phenomenal, sometimes excellent and occasionally good.   The bone marrow, oysters and caviar was the best thing I’ve ever eaten.  

The select wine pairing was a mixed bag.   Some wines were perfect but also stood on their own and others needed the food to work.  

Service was friendly and efficient.  It was really nice to see the chefs working. And also delivering the food explanations. 

So what was odd.  Minor points but there were misses such as a sticky table, wine going missing and messy aprons on servers. 

So this felt like an excellent meal delivered in a friendly place and therefore not quite perfection.   For me that worked just fine","0","","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-03","2024-11-02","en","L'Enclume","800663","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499539-d800663-r978469406-L_Enclume-Cartmel_Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html"

Our table was next to the anvil (for which Lenclume is famous) which gave us a good view and plenty of light.

The menu was a mix of old favourites and flavours of the season. 

The service was exquisite as usual - friendly, well timed and demonstrating excellent team work.

Every course was delicious. I can’t pick out one. The attention to detail is stunning - from the flowers to the sweet leaf.

Indulge in the cheese and you got a wide range.

The Food and Service, Whao !

Pick the company you enjoy most to experience this with and make sure you relax and laugh as initially we were a bit overwhelmed by the formal service standard.
However, about fours hours after taking our seats, we were still enthralled in conversation and delight.

We were helped to choose a lovely wine and later a dessert wine, but no pressure, at any time. The kitchen ran like a well oiled machine. We were permitted an introduction to the kitchen and was able to personally thank the more than a dozen hard working perfectionist chefs, with more tweezers than my local beauticians ... Each dish a work of art...not a picasso .... More refined... More perfection.
The taste of fresh local produce shone ... The fish gleamed ... As if polished, the desserts glistened, the whole evening was completely amazing. Highly recommended. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/9f/d8/4e/caption.jpg

We have never been so disappointed by a three star restaurant.  The first five appetisers were delicious, promising a wonderful meal.  From then on it went rapidly downhill, every dish being either much too salty or dominated by an aggressive pickled vegetable flavour. By the end of the meat course I had an unpleasant taste in my mouth I could not shake off. 

Such a shame.  The service was outstanding, the project management left us in awe and the cooking was incredibly precise, well up to the standards we have seen at Moor Hall, the Ledbury and Core. Whoever had the idea to ruin all this with clumsy seasoning and inappropriate sequencing of similar-tasting dishes scarcely deserves a single Michelin star.  A rare failure from my go to restaurant guide.","3","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-25","2024-09-25","en","L'Enclume","800663","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499539-d800663-r971320303-L_Enclume-Cartmel_Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html"

Firstly the staff, what a great team Simon Rogan has, they were just perfect not hovering or intrusive. Each dish was clearly described. Now the food, what can I say but wow! Each bite was just amazing. Stand out dish savoury seaweed custard. Never had anything like it every mouthful was a taste sensation. Sadly least favourite was the beef. We all found it slightly tough and underwhelming.  Matching wines were excellent and Dave did a great job as sommelier. Can’t recommend highly enough especially for a birthday.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-08-22","2024-08-22","en","L'Enclume","800663","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499539-d800663-r966143523-L_Enclume-Cartmel_Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html"

Their 3 stars are totally deserved but it’s not just the food that makes this place exceptional. 

Our taxi dropped us off outside a random building and we were a little confused, except for the very small sign on the wall fairly low down the entrance is nearly invisible. As soon as you walk in you are met by one of the many truly wonderful, friendly warm staff members who immediately do everything they can to make your visit special. This isn’t a stuffy over priced restaurant, it’s a wonderful experience of amazing food, fantastic wines and engaging staff. I honestly can’t compliment the staff enough. They were all extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, wines, produce and history of the building.

I now get to say I’ve  licked my plate in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, in front of one of the staff and I was absolutely egged on by them (it isn’t something I’ve ever done in any restaurant let alone my own home but it was hilarious).  

There were so maybe fabulous courses to try that picking just one favourite is too hard and I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who likes to be surprised. I will however say that they need to register the word crumplings (a crumpet dumpling hybrid) and they were delicious. 

A special thanks to the restaurant manager for his assistance in getting us back to our accommodation. That was very good service indeed!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/3a/4b/98/caption.jpg

We need not have worried. Simon Rogan and his team have everything worked out perfectly. Service is a fine art and worth the money alone.
As for the food, each bite is a new taste. I can't pretend to understand half of the dishes but I can say that we all thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful.

Jordan, the sommelier, was excellent but we struggled to hear the food descriptions from a number of the waiters and waitresses.  Many of the food courses lacked enough distinction between them, perhaps because they were so rich.  My wine flight, whilst very enjoyable, was made up almost entirely of white wine, with just the one red wine.  Finally, when you are paying £700 for a meal you do not expect to pay £10 extra for coffee.","2","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-08","2024-08-08","en","L'Enclume","800663","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499539-d800663-r963806596-L_Enclume-Cartmel_Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html"

L'Enclume was quite simply the most spectacular dining experience of our lives. Everything from the second you stepped through the door, to the second you left was perfect. 

The highlight obviously was the staggeringly incredible food. However, the unwaveringly professional but relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere created by the front-of-house superstars (Restaurant Ninja's we called you - never missed a thing, even down the the tiniest detail) made the entire experience unforgettable. Simon Rogan and his amazing team made Zara's 40th birthday dinner a lifelong highlight.

Graeme, Tom, Paul, Alex, Vlad, Hannah, Henry and everyone else on dinner service Weds 31st July 2024 - you made our evening so very special, it was an honour watching you work your magic. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

We didn’t expect to be able to get a reservation at such short notice but we were pleasantly surprised when we did - only a few days before. 

L’Enclume (French for “The Anvil”) has the feel of a top class establishment when you arrive, with a discreet entrance and a minimalistic layout. 

Throughout the evening you can experience a cast delivering top quality service and food to match. Unlike the Fat Duck this is all about the dishes and the locally sourced ingredients, if you an “experience” then head a few hundred miles south to Bray - this cannot be compared to that. 

Nevertheless this meets the objective of a unique and memorable meal - and the wine flight to accompany each course is recommended, the Sommelier will ensure you leave educated and tipsy! 

So, why a 4/5 rating? For the price of the evening it didn’t quite meet expectations. Perhaps the Michelin Star “Rogan & Co” option that Simon has literally just down the road in Cartmel may have been a better fit for us (and our budget). If we do come back we’ll try that one next time.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/ce/a8/9b/caption.jpg
