Sat on the chef’s table.
The chef and his wife are the restaurants hosts. They are warm and hospitable.
But, this is a big but, it is not amongst the top in Asia. It doesn’t deserve two Michelin stars. At $250 per head, it was super expensive and most definitely not worth it. Shame we came really expecting an innovative amazing meal. It is warm and welcoming, but gimmicky and almost making fun of guests at these prices. I do not understand but fully respect the guests that gave it high ratings. I simple didn’t have this experience, neither did any of my guests.
I wish them luck.","1","","FRIENDS","2023-04-30","2023-04-10","2023-04-10","en","Den","13237922","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r885592079-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

I wanted to share my reservation experience with everyone in hopes it helps get YOU a reservation here.  

Like you I was frustrated by having to call, not being able to book online, and not being able to use my hotel concierge.

Den takes reservations by phone only from 12-5pm Tokyo Time.

So I had 4 nights in Tokyo.  So I figure I got this.

First night:  155 calls all from 12-130 tokyo time.  Nothing  and phone was very busy.  Only every 20 minutes did it ring at all.

Second Night.  175 calls.  12-145.  Same as before except.  I went to bed woke up 3 hours later and called another 10 minutes and got through.(430 Tokyo time) but all booked and wait listed.

Third Night:  Was busy and could not call till 215 Tokyo Time.  It rang many more times than busy signals and I got a table.

Lesson on HOW TO GET A TABLE.  Dont call right at noon Tokyo time.  Wait till about 2pm (or 130pm if you have no patience)  I would bet your odds are way better as 1.  People have gotten tables.  2.  People have given up.   

Lastly:  I was told you can email to ask about the days tables and to be added to the waitlist at 5pm Tokyo time (2 months in advance, the same night you are calling) and that may work.  

Hope this helps..","15","","COUPLES","2019-07-31","2019-07-12","2019-07-12","en","Den","13237922","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r688867607-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

Food: 5","Reservation: nearly impossible. Experience: Impossibly good.","Yes, the reservation rules are absurd: by phone only between 12 and 5pm Tokyo time, precisely two months in advance. It seems every foodie on earth calls at precisely the same time, so the line rings busy, or the circuit doesn't work.  But after a few hundred attempts, a voice answers. A real live voice. She's Noriko, and you're immediately put at ease. You think ""This is going to be worth all the effort.""  Then you anxiously count down the days, having second thoughts about whether the frustration of all those international redials will have been worth it. And it is.

Our evening at Den was a blast. Inventive, delicious, yet somehow unpretentious food start to finish. Chef Zaiyu cooks with his tongue in cheek (google the expression if you're not an American or Brit), his sense of humor evident in every dish. It's playful, joyful, and surprising food. Chef Zaiyu, Noriko, Joy, Jesus and the team are in it to win it -- we watched them treat every diner to the same terrific experience, yet we often felt like we were the only people in the room, receiving their full attention. I won't critique the food other than to say it's worthy of all the praise, nothing is quite as it appears at first glance, and it will be a meal you'll remember. Den celebrates food and shows diners that high-end dining doesn't have to be serious or stodgy.","2","","COUPLES","2019-05-31","2019-06-11","2019-06-11","en","Den","13237922","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r680744332-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

The chef and staff have carefully curated a meal that is based on Japanese traditions and techniques but have lifted it to a fun, playful and absolutely delicious level. For those who gave poor reviews or did not enjoy their experience here - perhaps they were expecting traditional fare in a stiff upper lip sort of Michelin standard place. 4 of us visited and absolutely loved it.

There isn’t much signage so even though located on a main road, it took us a few minutes to find the place. Once in - the lady of the house (dressed in kimono) made us feel so at home. We were greeted like long lost friends and she knew all our names and where we came from immediately (details were submitted when we booked). We sat at a communal table but it didn’t detract from the experience; in fact it made it more fun as we got to see reactions of the other patrons when food was served. Every dish in the menu was given much thought in terms of presentation, taste and after-taste. The chef definitely knows his way around as the resulting textures, tastes and even smells were really spot on. Quite a few dishes had a playful take and suffice to say, we enjoyed all our courses. There is no menu or drinks menu; you have to trust your waiter who will recommend - be it sake, wine, soft drink. It’s a little discerning at first to not know (but she allowed us to taste before hand to see what we preferred) and even price wise - it was a surprise as you only know at the end when the bill is presented. However,  the restaurant is not out to rip you off so just relax, drink and enjoy. We found prices charged for drinks at the end to be quite reasonable. 

Service was outstanding - informal, friendly and you were treated like an honored guest in someone’s home rather than in a restaurant. My only comment overall is that lighting in the restaurant is very bright and a little harsh. A softer shade and a drop in wattage of the light bulbs would definitely make the ambience a little more friendly.

Getting a reservation is not easy - you need to persevere and keep calling! Well worth it!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/dd/db/b1/photo5jpg.jpg

Staff service was impeccable- everyone we encountered, including the Chef was beyond kind. Wait staff was knowledgeable about all the sakes they offered  & overall it was just a really enjoyable evening. 

The food was delicious- including the things I didn’t think I would enjoy. I was expecting fried chicken with the Den-Tucky Fried Chicken, & while i’m still not sure what it was filled with, was divine. The Brussels sprouts & fish was delightful. Clam broth soup was also tasty, with many levels of flavors for a broth based soup. The Den-salad, 3 types of Tuna- all the delicate edible flowers that compliment each dish... it’s just all so thoughtful. 

I would recommend a seat facing the kitchen- made the night that much more fun. Overall great experience.

Most of them name and rank establishments that are often quite controversial. Whilst mostly treated by serious foodies with a grain of salt, however, the number of followers using a list like ‘ Sam Pellegrino World’s 50 best Restaurant ‘ to augment, plan and select top restaurants for their eating adventure and collection of stars are still quite substantial. Participation by some of these blind-followers, tacked on additional layers of obstacles and challenges for those serious and avid gourmands, seeking to secure already tough-to-get top tables.

My Day 2 dinner will be at such a ‘hard-to-get-in ‘ establishment! Our venue, the Michelin 2* ‘DEN’ is ranked #17 on the Sam Pellegrino’s 2018 best list. As Tokyo top rated restaurant on the list and ahead of its compatriots like Narisawa and Ryugin, it’s ranking is even higher than a lot of gastronomic temples worldwide like Paris’ Alain Ducasse and Ledoyen, Copenhagen’s Germanium, NYC’s Le Bernadin, Chicago’s Alinea, San Sebastian Arzak….to name a few.
Once again, a big thank you to my local foodie friend in securing this rare reservation for our group.

Operated by a highly creative young chef with a fine sense of humor, the restaurant offers a multi-course Omakase ‘Modern Kaiseki’ menu. Dishes crafted by him and his competent ‘ international ‘ kitchen team not only tasted good but also contained elements of playfulness.

Case in point, a starting amuse bouche in the form of a traditional Japanese dessert - Monoka ( bean jam filled mochi ). However, to our surprise, the mochi wafer actually took on a savory twist with filling of Foie Gras, Japanese pickles and Persimmons! Tasty and really fun to eat.

Another tasty and amusing offering was the chef’s famous ‘DFC’ – DEN Fried Chicken. A piping hot, super crispy fried chicken wing stuffed with crab paste housed in a ‘red and white’, Colonel Sander’s KFC lookalike box! Cute and brilliant! The ultimate finger food!

Whilst my home town Toronto has its own Susur Lee and his famous Singapore Slaw. DEN’s version of a salad, appropriately named ‘ Garden’, was a few notches more sophisticated and refined. Containing 20 different vegetables ( Daikon, beets, yams, Burdock and lotus roots, mushrooms, asparagus, leafy and non-leafy greens….), every component was individually prepared, cooked and assembled. ( Fried, grilled, blanched, boiled, raw……). The labor intensiveness of this dish is absolutely mind-boggling! Bravo to team work and the kitchen team!

Service was professional, helpful and lovely. Every one of our serving staff spoke English! Our main lady server, with a Sake sommelier certificate, was most pleasant and knowledgeable in guiding us through our Sake tasting selection. Some real fine, rare jewels were brought out for our enjoyment!

This is one delicious, enjoyable and FUN chowdown!......and only my second day in town! Already, I hated the idea of having to go home in a week’s time!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/b2/2e/e9/grilled-spanish-mackerel.jpg

Food: 5","Incredibly fun dining experience!","We’ve been fortunate enough to dine at a number of Michelin restaurants globally (Japan, New York, Italy, Austria), and this one of our favourite experiences by far! We were excited to dine here mainly because of all the accolades this restaurant has received in the past year (named no. 18 in the world, no. 2 in Asia), and it did not disappoint! The vibe is warm and casual, in an open concept and fun environment — one pillar is covered with handwritten comments from guests, and one of the appliances in the kitchen is covered in fun stickers. The food is just as fun and innovative as the environment — from Den’s signature “Dentucky Fried Chicken” complete with a takeaway box, to the signature salad with a smiley face, it was so refreshing to experience GOOD food in such a relaxed environment. Our takeaways boxes had mini country flags, indicating our nationality, which was such a nice personalized touch! On a technical level, the food is complex but not in presentation, rather in preparation with simple and seasonal ingredients. We loved the soup with winter melon and pork belly that warmed your soul, as well as the rice with pork shoulder — so simple and tasty! The menu is slightly smaller than Den’s 2 star counterparts in Japan, but that doesn’t mean you leave feeling any less fulfilled. Beyond the food and the environment, was the incredible hospitality that Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa and his staff provided. At one point, Chef’s beloved dog, Puchi, made an appearance, and he was the most adorable thing! When service died down, Chef was cradling Puchi in his lap and it was so heartwarming to see his affection for his dog. We were the last guests to leave, and after we played with Puchi, took some photos with Chef, Chef himself and the entire staff (front and back of house), cheerfully walked us out the restaurant, and into our taxi, waving goodbye as we pulled away — it was such a touching send off! I had read all the reviews about how difficult it was to call the restaurant and make a reservation, and I certainly encountered that myself (I called 3-4 different occasions, 1.5 months before our trip). Eventually, I got through and connected with Noriko, who confirmed our reservation, and was such a delight in person! Making a reservation was not exactly easy, but it was so absolutely worth it, and we cannot wait to return!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/15/c8/0b/98/caption.jpg

Food: 5","A fun, delicious and magical experience","Den provides the most fun you will ever have at a Michelin star restaurant, or anywhere for that matter. Everyone who works at Den makes you feel like you are a friend at their home. The food is delightful, delicious and makes you laugh with it's cleverness and quirkiness. The chef interacts with his guests all evening, the guests all talk to each other and it was the most joy filled evening I can remember. My final memory was Zaiyu waving goodbye from outside, holding his adorable little dog.","0","","COUPLES","2018-10-31","2018-11-03","2018-11-03","en","Den","13237922","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r630583971-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

It did not disappoint, despite the arduous reservation process. 

The highlights:

- The people. We chose DEN because it sounded fun, warm, and relaxed—far from the stuffy, uptight eateries we tend to avoid. From the email correspondence to the first greeting to the farewell, in which the entire staff stepped out of the restaurant to wave goodbye, everyone on the DEN team showcased genuine warmth, knowledge, professionalism, and hospitality. They took us through each course and sake sampling like they were hosting us for dinner in their home. They invited questions and interaction. 
- Chef Zaiyu. Our seats faced the kitchen, and we were honoured to watch a master in action. He took the time to greet and interact with the guests. I purchased one of his cookbooks and he took 10 minutes after the meal to sign an elaborate message on the inside cover. What a star. 
- Of course, the food! Admittedly, not every course was to my taste, but every single one was inventive, creative, beautifully conceptualized and presented, and like nothing we’ve tasted before. The house sake, which is produced exclusively for DEN, was the best we came across in Japan. 
- Puchi, Jr! Chef Zaiyu’s pup has become something of an Instagram star, and we were excited to meet him face to face. He was an adorable way to cap off the experience. 
- The value. At 20,000 yen, we had an unforgettable meal, far less expensive than other kaiseki restaurants in the country. 

The lowlights:

- It’s not easy to reserve a table. And you have to duck to enter the washrooms. Those are seriously the only drawbacks I can think of. 

Overall, I highly recommend DEN for anyone looking to enjoy a world-class meal while hanging out with a world-renowned chef in a fun, laidback atmosphere. We’ve visited many Michelin star establishments, and DEN is by far the most fun.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/13/bb/5c/den.jpg

It was a cooperation event at the Ritz Carlton Hotel with Chef Royer from Odette, Singapore. We were very impressed by what he presented. We decided right away to make a trip to Tokyo and dine at his restaurant.

We are glad that we came because what we got from the dinner in Hong Kong was just an enticing trailer of a great movie. At DEN, we saw up close how the Chef and his team were working in the kitchen. We tasted the amazing food from the ever changing menu he created with the freshest seasonal ingredients. We also felt the genuine hospitality from his wife, Emi San and the rest of the Hasegawa family. And of course, we got to play with his adorable dog Picu. This restaurant is on the top for a reason and that is what one must pay them a visit to experience first hand. Really well done!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/77/aa/c9/photo0jpg.jpg

Food: 4","Fun food - less careful and more carefree","Was looking forward to the visit as I had read that Den is fun and the food is great. I really enjoyed both aspects, the service is attentive and really fun and engaging. I sat on the bar facing the kitchen so engaging with the kitchen was easy but as service slowed the chef did come out and talk to all of the tables as well.

Food wise, my menu for the night I visited (10th Aug) was:

Starter:

Monaka (Japanese traditional confectionary sweets) sandwiched with foie gras marinated in white miso, Japanese prune jam (sumomo), and pickled radish. 

Second course:
Tokoroten Jelly noodle made from tomato, served with passion fruits, basil seeds and dashi vinegar jelly

DENtucky Fried Chicken:
Deep fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice and grilled matsutake mushroom

Sashimi:
Katsuo (Bonito) from Shizuoka served with Japanese mustard (karashi)

Grilled dish:
Freshwater eel (unagi) grilled with brush of soy sauce,  served with grilled peppers and grated spicy daikon

garDEN salad:
Signature salad with 20 different kinds of vegetable prepared in different cooking methods such as  deep-fried, pickled, grilled, raw ...etc

Soup:
Soup with pork and Japanese pickles - our homemade pickled cabbages, and Kyoto pickles ""suguki""

Rice: 
Sirloin beef rice with 16 types of grains, served with Japanese pickles (myouga, cucumber, eggplants) and miso soup

Dessert:
Peach marinated in mint, rum jelly and yogurt sorbet.

It was a really interesting menu, all great quality and excellent flavours but also very different for a fine dining establishment - less careful and more carefree. I really enjoyed all of the courses, especially the garDEN which is one of the best salad/vegetable dishes I have ever had. Drinks wise there is no wine list, you are offered selections from sake and wine per course and I enjoyed some very interesting choices. My total bill was far less then I have paid in other top restaurants in Japan.

I would recommend a visit and keep in mind the fun factor.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/3c/a6/9c/unagi.jpg
