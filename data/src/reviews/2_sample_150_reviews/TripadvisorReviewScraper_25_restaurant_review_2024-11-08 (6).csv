	1.	Peaceful Setting: Toya is located in a serene and picturesque area, right on the border of a golf course and adjacent to a small hotel. The tranquil surroundings make for a relaxing dining experience.
	2.	Popularity: Despite visiting on a weekday at lunchtime, the restaurant was full, indicating its popularity and strong reputation.
	3.	Excellent Service: From start to finish, the service level was outstanding. The staff were attentive and professional, enhancing the overall dining experience.
	4.	Unique Menu Concept: The restaurant offers “surprise” menus where you select the number of courses, and the Chef and his team prepare dishes based on the freshest available ingredients. This adds an element of excitement and ensures a unique dining experience each time.
	5.	Extensive Wine List: Toya boasts a large wine list and offers a wine pairing option with the menus, which can enhance the culinary experience. The sommelier’s house cocktail, featuring blueberry liqueur and pine spirit, is a delightful addition to the drink offerings.

Cons:

	1.	Isolated Location: The restaurant is somewhat isolated, situated near the small city of Faulquemont. A vehicle is necessary to get there, which might be inconvenient for some guests.
	2.	Language Barrier: While the service was excellent, the staff’s limited proficiency in English might pose a challenge for foreign guests. It’s advisable to have some knowledge of French or be prepared for some communication difficulties.

Overall: Toya offers an excellent dining experience with its peaceful setting, exceptional service, and unique menu concept. Despite the need for a vehicle to reach the somewhat isolated location and the potential language barrier, it is definitely worth a visit for a memorable meal.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/7d/8e/b6/caption.jpg

Food: 2","a pretty face","Apparently I will be the first less-than-rave english language review but I do see some in the French language. On the surface, the restaurant presents a welcoming clean design with a very friendly professional staff. I speak very highly of the staff. The dishes were plated extremely well, utilising earthy designs with rocks, ""slice"" of tree trunks etc. 

The actual food, however, was a let-down. I am still waiting for at least one ""wow"" dish. Several of the small bite-sized amuse bouche and desserts were sitting in tartlet shells which I believe were purchased, since they were perfectly symmetric and bland. 
One of the fish dishes (raw sea bass) was completely flavourless and a strange texture. I still cannot believe the asparagus...a surprisingly cold barely blanched spear of white asparagus wrapped in ""something"" accompanied by a chunk of warm asparagus...it did LOOK exciting with a Jackson-Pollock like appearance. And, I am amused reading one of the reviews which also mentions the rock-hard chunks of turnip...what was that supposed to be?
Nothing really offered any spark of flavor or excitement. This was very disappointing in a Michelin-starred restaurant. 
Sure, some cooking techniques were showcased, but I can make a foam too! 
At the end, I realized that the chef was maybe trying too hard to incorporate some Japanese/Asian influences...most clearly seen in the ice cream with saki poured over it. (which was served in a small shot glass that didn't accommodate the spoon which came with it---details). 

In the end...disappointment in every dish. Not one was something I really enjoyed. No, wait...the chef apparently makes his own butter which was superb.","1","","FRIENDS","2016-05-31","2016-05-15","2016-05-15","en","Toya","1906797","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r373154777-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html"

What can I add to my previous comment, except the presence of Chef Loïc, who was absent during our first visit. He is present with all simplicity among his guests, as are the wise members of the staff. The explanation of each dish, starting with the fresh water from the garden and the appetizers which promise the rest of the meal, tantalize our taste buds by announcing gustatory delights!
The Chef works with local products, starting from his garden for vegetables, including bread with wheat and rye from the farm next door, accompanied by delicious butter from Jersey cows (killer!!). I have not forgotten the snail cromesquis from Thionville, the arctic char from the Heimbach source, the lamb from Beux, reminding us that our Lorraine Alsace region is rich in quality products and passionate producers. The salmon, with colonnata bacon with its poultry juice and whey emulsion is not left out in this symphony of explosion of flavors, sometimes spicy, sometimes sweet, but always subtle.
And the desserts, ah the desserts!! We would never have dared to imagine that the marriage of parsnips, chicory and cereals could give us such delight, just like working with honey from the Chef's own hives!
This delicious delight ended with succulent treats and especially the little birthday cakes, a gesture much appreciated on our part.

Applied service, which features the culinary score of a Chef who perfectly masters his subject, playing with tastes, textures and consistencies with precision. This cuisine is cooked with products of impeccable rigor and gives pride of place to regional producers.
How pleasant it is to deal with a passionate, competent and affable sommelier. Its selected wines hit the mark, such as this Altesse varietal Savoie wine served as an aperitif which immediately opens your palate.
A few dices of Foie Gras, a shredded lobster coral crepe drizzled with an aromatic chicken stock as desired, celestine-like Consommé, crunchy cabbage with sweet Munster cheese and onions, homemade black pudding fritter and fruit apples, tartlet around radish in snacks quickly set the tone.
All this presented and explained by the Chef himself.
What more can I say that the arctic char from the source of the Heimbach stream goes like a letter in the post, that the wild salmon in poultry juice with supple flesh and subtle flavor was just cooked or just cooked, that the beef of the Jersiaire breed, from the breeding of the Belles Roses farm, is of unparalleled tenderness, all accompanied by homemade bread, but not just any bread!! Sourdough, wheat and rye flour from the farm next door: the kind of bread you would want to take for breakfast the next day: a real treat.
The only downside in this score is that the sauce is as smooth as can be but strong in the mouth, perhaps due to an overdose of horseradish...shhhh!!!
The farandole of desserts does not escape enchantment, which makes it, in this Moselle countryside, a high-end starred restaurant, which gives a good reason to come there.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-13","2024-03-13","en","Toya","1906797","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r942208256-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html"

The staff is welcoming and attentive. My wife being vegetarian, the team did everything to ensure she had a wonderful time. The menu was really delicious and tasty. We were particularly impressed by the honey and citrus themed desserts, which were an explosion of flavors on the palate. The dishes were magnificent, the seats were incredibly comfortable and the sommelier, who we gave carte blanche, recommended wines that perfectly matched our dishes. We would like to thank you for all these little details which, when put together, helped make our experience truly wonderful!","0","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-25","2024-02-25","en","Toya","1906797","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r939744536-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html"

We were looking for a place suitable for this event and we found it! Nothing but happiness from start to finish..The very friendly setting, well-spaced tables, warmth of wood and natural materials just like the meal, which puts local seasonal products in the spotlight. From the geranium water from the garden, through the snacks, homemade bread, butter, arctic char, salmon, Galician veal, to finishing with divine desserts, this meal was magical. I haven't forgotten the attentive staff, the wise advice of the sommelier, all in a good mood. Only one regret: We have to leave this magical place!
We thank you for this timeless evening!","0","","FAMILY","2024-02-29","2024-02-24","2024-02-23","en","Toya","1906797","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r939568227-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html"

The room is very bright with a designer and elegant raw and wooded decor. All the tables are very spaced apart. We see that the chef seeks the happiness of the guests and not the number of place settings, which is pleasant. The service is very professional and relaxed.
We had pleasure menus (starter and dessert), knowing that there are 2 appetizers and a pre-dessert and sweets! All of chef Loic Villemin's cuisine is focused on local products, small producers, the quality of the products, the Michelin green star is completely justified.
None of the dishes served were below the others. A ballet of subtle flavors, from fir thorn cream to snails and caviar with horseradish sauce, through Lorraine paté-style deer, to finish with 2 very high-end desserts (honey from its own production in crumble / ice cream, pollen, panacotta, then pomelo yuzu, citrus jelly), everything was mastered, as beautiful as it was delicious.
The star is well deserved. Having had many star establishments throughout France, we are clearly flirting with the second star.
Congratulations to the whole team for this magnificent tasting!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/26/17/d1/caption.jpg
