They have a tasting menu but it was late so we opted to go a la carte.  The food was elegantly prepared. The highlight was  a desert called in front of the fireplace - that combines coffee, tobacco, cedar wood, spices and chocolate.  It was amazing and unlike anything else I have tasted.","1","","FAMILY","2016-05-31","2016-05-23","2016-05-23","en","La Peca","2013570","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1144296-d2013570-r375759142-La_Peca-Lonigo_Province_of_Vicenza_Veneto.html"

Food: 5","Leaves you begging for more....!","We visited this restaurant in may, staying near Verona and looking for fancy place to have lunch. Checking the Guide L'Espresso (IMHO the most reliable guide for fine dining in Italy), I found this restaurant in Lonigo. All I can say is that this was really worth the drive (of 50 min.)!

The restaurant is quite modern in style, but in a warm, comfortable way. The dining room is at the first floor, equipped with large windows delivering a superb view over the countryside and hills of Veneto.

The staff, leaded by Miss Cinzia, is professional and kind, making you feel welcome from the first minute.

We choose the lunch-menu, which consisted of a pasta, secondo and a little dessert. The lunch started of with some very nice and tasty appetizers. The pasta dish (gnocchi with asparagus and spinach) was fresher than fresh and a real threat for the tast buds.
The secondo dish was a very well cooked piece of duck with some seasonal herbs and salad. Than a nice and refreshing/light dessert of fresh fruits and yoghurt foam. The lunch ended with an superb cup of espresso accompanied by homemade pastries.
This was a superb lunch at only €40! A bargain at this level of dining!

The winelist is very extensive and delivers all the goods from Italy and the rest of the world at reasonable prices. The helpful sommelier is always there to put you in the right direction when it comes to wine/food matching. We had two really good bottles at very decent prices.

This is a place to look after when you around in the Veneto region and looking for a fancy place to dine. It was really worth the drive from Verona! 

Highly recommendable and worth every penny! We will definitely come back here!","2","","FRIENDS","2015-05-31","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","en","La Peca","2013570","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1144296-d2013570-r276356411-La_Peca-Lonigo_Province_of_Vicenza_Veneto.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Haute cuisine, style and view. Simply one of the top restaurants in Italy","La Peca is one of best examples of “haute cuisine” you can have in nowadays Italy.  Everything is sophisticated and top level. First of all, the restaurant,  modern and beautifully located in the Veneto countryside: you may enjoy a pleasant view of the Berici Mountains from the large windows. Furniture is pure design, with a tasteful combination of several modern designers, including stylish chairs by Philippe Stark.  Food is supreme. Difficult to describe the ever changing menu, which ranges from appetizers to primi piatti and includes with the same taste and creativity both fish and meat. We are at the top of Italian cousine and you see it and you feel it. It is also a visual experience. Nothing to recommend in particular, and all to be recommended: how can you possibly recommend perfection? Just be tempted by the set menu “Ore 12” which gives you a flavor of different types of dishes. Wine list is in line with the quality of the food. La Peca is at the top end of the market and does not come cheap. However for the sophisticated traveler with a passion for the haute cuisine it is an experience not to be missed. Simply one of the top restaurants all throughout Italy","1","","FRIENDS","2012-01-31","2012-06-10","2012-06-10","en","La Peca","2013570","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1144296-d2013570-r131659644-La_Peca-Lonigo_Province_of_Vicenza_Veneto.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Understated elegance","What do you mean about a place that has had two Michelin stars for almost thirty years? What can you say that doesn't taste stale, useless, banal? It is a place whose welcome is of whose cuisine has already been said all the good possible because you can not say anything but all the good possible.
What is striking is the elegance that shines through in all the expressions of the place ... an elegance that stands on delicate balances but created and managed with mastery. There is never excess, never ostentation, never an attempt to put the merits of the place before you want the customer. Everything is elegant and simple at the same time ... as simple rubber ducks become designer furnishings, just as simple stale bread becomes a refined gourmet cracker, seemingly simple vegetables turn into an original tasting, innovative yet sober and contained ... elegant of that country elegance that you breathe looking from the large windows of the room ... an elegance without cracks, without uncertainties, a sign of a game of a team with deep roots, clear vision, shared goals.

The place is very welcoming with a nice arrangement of tables in the different rooms of the structure. Elegant and tasteful furnishings. The owners and the entire staff welcomed us warmly and affectionately. Nicola Portinari's cuisine is absolutely worth trying to discover unique and particular sensations. The raw materials are treated with care and with cooking techniques that fully enhance their characteristics. The tasting menus are very interesting. For the occasion, however, both my table and I chose the à la carte dishes. Worth noting: the boom of baby squid, fermented ricotta and wild fennel, the risotto of black cabbage, horseradish and mountain goat's cheese, the ravioli of maruzzelle and chard with garlic and chilli pepper (stepitosi), the Livornese-style mullet, barbecue leek, eel baked with embers, shiitake, seaweed and daikon mixed salad, croaker with calamondin artichokes and ginger, ""Zeffiro"" guinea fowl with turmeric and spinach in two consistencies. A separate chapter should be dedicated to desserts or rather to the works of Pierluigi Portinari. Perfect in every way in preparation and presentation. They deserve to be mentioned:
the dark chocolate soufflé, coffee ice cream, apricot and peated whisky, the lemon tart with almond sorbet and salted almonds. Another separate mention to make is the wine list or rather the very good and very knowledgeable sommelier Matteo. Just listening to the description of the wines that he makes with passion and with so much love and competence is worth a trip in itself. A round of applause also to all the dining room staff, young, attentive and very professional.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/b0/03/33/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","A peck with a heart..","Nicola Portinari is truly a great chef, master of low cooking. A dish that I will always carry in my heart is spaghettone with spring onion and red mullet, accompanied by an extraordinary drink, to say the least.
For the rest, nothing to add. Absolutely passed with flying colors with a well-deserved 2 stars. The place is very elegant, although perhaps you expect something more upon arrival. However, once you enter, the music starts and the place takes shape, just like the gorgeous imprint you'll find on the water glass.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/2d/a1/e6/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","An emotional dinner","This place is perfect. The impeccable service and unforgettable dishes are evidently the result of years of work and a continuous search for harmony. The atmosphere is starry, but there is always the possibility of having an informal chat with the hosts.
The dishes at La Peca are a pleasure for the palate, for the eyes and for the heart.
It is not always easy to find starred restaurants where the price justifies the experience, but this is not the case.
Thanks to all the staff, we will definitely be back.
