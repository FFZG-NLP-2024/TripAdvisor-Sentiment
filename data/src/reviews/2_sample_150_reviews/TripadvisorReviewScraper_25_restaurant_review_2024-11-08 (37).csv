Food: 3","The Chef's Ego Is Bigger Than His Menu","A complicated menu with some of the offerings not available. The place is extremely overpriced for what they offer - olives soaked in olive oil with a weak ""citrus"" condiment; oysters on the half shell with possibly the most boring sauce ever (green mamão vinagrete), raviolis no better than anything you'd get at Eataly, meat you could do yourself at home, pork with lots of fat in it - the Chef's ego is bigger than his creations. I will never return, service was weak and they suggested 14% when standard tips in São Paulo are 10%. Impossible to rate this experience above average and if you reserve and don't show up, he'll charge you. There are literally hundreds of better places in the city. Nothing of this experience was memorable.","1","","NONE","2021-11-30","2021-11-28","2021-11-28","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r820373640-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

Food: 3","Nice restaurant with excellent desserts","Located in a trendy neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants. Small house with modern design, very nice decor and lots of room between tables so you do not feel cramped.

Very friendly staff, casual service.

Food is ok. For me the starters and mains were ok but not really good. Only the mushrooms were delicious. The codfish Salad was not very tasty. The pork rib was very greasy and not tender. 

But what was really excellent: the desserts, the French toast was excellent, crunchy and extremely tasteful. And the Pingado, similar to Tiramisu, was absolutely delicious.

Small wine list.

I liked this place because of the design and the desserts. However it is a bit surprising to find this restaurant in the Pellegrino list of top restaurants of South America because there are too many dishes that are not convincing. But if you like nice design it can still be a good experience.","0","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-31","2021-10-31","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r816818566-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

But no doubt coming from the old brother Tuju, deserves Michelin stars.

Food: 5","Tuju or Not Tuju?  TUJU of course! (But let's not be so serious...)","Too many Michelin-starred properties with public chefs seem to have lost the one main ingredient necessary to any good meal...joy.  Joy in the cooking, joy in the serving and joy in the eating. 
Tuju got the last two out of three correct...but with a center kitchen on full display, the first joy was blatantly missing. 
Yes, food is important, and with a 12-course tasting dinner with paired wines, there are a lot of details that could possibly get missed, but kids, come on, it's food! Enjoy it! 
Tabled in front of the finishing kitchen watching the 12 or so young professionals cooking and plating, I felt that I was witnessing a religious rite...all choreographed and all so, so serious.  To be fair, this appeared to be a reflection of Chef Ralston, who visited the kitchen several times to insure the creations were perfect...and they were.... seriously perfect. 
Chef Ralston, and his executive chef Rhaiza, have created a beautiful and serene space in which to explore his seasonal take on Brazilian cuisine. And 'his take' is delicious, intriguing, sometimes challenging, and overall a delight; and one that I would love to revisit as the seasons change, however...
My visit to Tuju was a highlight of a Pinheiros neighborhood food tour, unfortunately, it wasn’t the acme. And it could have been with just a hint of joy-in-the-doing emanating from the kitchen.
To all of the staff at Tuju, obrigado! It was a lovely experience. But please, let's not be so serious Chef!","2","","NONE","2020-02-29","2020-02-23","2020-02-23","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r746934105-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

Food: 5","A view of fine dining through Brazilian eyes.","Following the trail blazed by D.O.M., TUJU by Chef Ivan Ralston pushes modern Brazilian Cuisine forward by not specifically showcasing local Ingredients, but reinterpreting the world through Brazilian eyes inside his Restaurant at Rua Fradique Coutinho 1248.

Open since 2014, and recently the recipient of a second Michelin Star, it is after passing through a hushed hallway that guests find themselves inside Ralston’s “kitchen theater,” a staff fluent in English leading guests to polished wooden tables that extend back towards the bar and urban garden on the patio.

A quiet and focused space in Vila Madalena, everything from TUJU’s design to Cocktail list indicative of a Chef who has spent time researching both technique and his culture, guests visiting for the first time are encouraged to partake in Ivan’s “Season Menu,” the carte blanche taking into account allergies and dislike but otherwise consisting of thirteen courses served across two hours.

Trained in the kitchens of Maní, RyuGin and Mugaritz, the latter identifiable in modernist spins on local Produce, it was while sipping on a strong drink of Gin and sweetened Acid that course one arrived, sliced and aerated Pumpkin forming the background for Peas and Citrus with herbs that carry over nicely to a “Taco” comprised of sweet Crab and shaved Corn wrapped in Nasturtium.

Continuing light with translucent Shrimp swimming in vibrant Broth, its follow-up a comparison of local River Mussels to those from the Atlantic bathed in Manioc Root Juice, fans of Uni will be stunned by tender Tongues amidst a tangle of Leeks with Parsnip Cream while torched Cauliflower finds itself the centerpiece of a thick Sauce that tastes something like Mole mixed with Soy.

Shifting back to Seafood, a tender Tentacle obtained through Chef Ralston’s relationship with local fisherman accented in umami, one would be hard-pressed to name a more interesting *looking* dish than Arapaima Fish in Seaweed Pil Pil, the combination of snappy Flesh and Skin Crisps equally tantalizing alongside Artichokes and Bean Sprouts.

Completing savories with grilled Tuna and two types of Palm plus unsweetened Açaí, a diversity of textures seeing the best bites those that incorporate a little of each into a single forkful, it is by way of Cheese that the palate is transitioned, the Blue and Parmesan-mimic particularly impressive, as too was housemade Bread and Butter plus the bright green Fruit described as a Fig. 

Not scaling back on sweets, Dessert number one perfuming stewed Berries with Mint in a makeshift Sundae, it was while Coffee dripped tableside that a tangy Yogurt Parfait dazzled, the Pour Over subsequently enjoyed with housemade Chocolates filled with everything from Dulce de Leche and Cashew Fruit to Garlic.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/19/64/fc/a7/19.jpg

We have ordered the smallest tasting menu , which was creative and tasteful . 

Lamb and fish were part of the sequence . Both were well prepared .

The carta of wines should be bigger to match such a good meals. 

Brazilian ingredients reminded me another good restaurant : DOM and the Chef Atala. 

High level service provided by waitress and maitre. Sommelier was not so confortable to speak in English ( I took a friend of mine from France to have a dinner at Tuju ). 

Based on Brazilian standards and taking into account the order was the smallest menu and only two glasses of wine, the final price might be considered high. On the other hand, this level of restaurant would be charged in a similar level abroad.

Incredible flavor combinations, fantastic presentation, and top notch service.  D.O.M. has some competition now.  The atmosphere is very modern. Which isn't to everyone's taste.

Don’t listen to any reviews that say that there is no soul or flavor in the food. It’s quite the opposite - we felt that the complexity of the depth and layers of flavor was perfectly executed and also appropriately balanced for each course from start to finish. We each experienced varying levels of umami moments throughout the evening and enjoyed the uniquely Brazilian ingredients that we would never get to experience anywhere else. 

The portions were well thought out.  I’ll have to admit that we were a bit intimidated with the idea of 12 courses but by the end we didn’t feel too full or heavy - just happily satisfied. 

I’ll also note that I’m vegan and my husband doesn’t eat pork. They had no problem accommodating our dietary restrictions. We also had the privilege of speaking with Chef Ivan Ralston towards the end of our meal - he was such a lovely presence and it was clear from our discussion that he’s in pursuit of excellence and innovation through his craft. 

We’ve eaten at Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and have sometimes been disappointed with some restaurants’ tasting menus given that one or more courses may end up being bland or weaker than the others. That was not the case here - each course was impressive. That’s quite a feat for 12 courses!

For all of the reasons noted above, we feel that this place deserves 3 stars instead of 2!

We hope to come back here again. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to dine here!","4","","COUPLES","2018-12-31","2018-12-15","2018-12-15","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r639715964-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

Food: 4","Short of expectations","We went for our anniversary dinner to Tuju last evening and had their five-course Farmers’ Market tasting menu. We felt it did not live up to our expectations from many perspectives.

First I would like to point out what we did like. Being light drinkers, we usually have just one glass of wine each. At Tuju, the by-the-glass offerings were outstanding, among the best I have seen in Brazil. Our server was also very intent on making sure we enjoyed the experience, going so far as offering a (very good) chocolate tasting to my chocolatolic wife, free of charge. Finally, we loved the dessert.

The first thing that bothered us was their timing. Shortly after we ordered the meal, the server brought us some butter, olive oil, and salt – but no bread. We waited and waited. Some 10 minutes later, the bread arrived. They claimed that it took so long because it was being warmed up. Yet we have been to many other places that serve warm bread without such delay.

We have been to a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Brazil and abroad, many I have reviewed on TA. Something we always enjoyed at such establishments was being surprised by the unusual flavors, textures, and looks. Tuju mostly failed at this. 

Our first course was a broccoli-based appetizer (Broccoli in miso marinade, cauliflower, and walnuts). It had a fancy name and description and the texture was interesting. But the taste was rather bland.

They were out of the second course, white clam. We opted then for octopus (my wife) and a couscous (myself). My wife enjoyed the tender texture of the octopus, but was unimpressed with the rest. I felt my couscous was nothing special as well.

The first main dish was a fish coated with its own roasted and ground scales, rather good. It was well prepared, delicate and very enjoyable.

The second main dish was a wagyu beef rib, with manioc flour and bacon bits. We were both unimpressed, unfortunately.

The dessert was called a corn-meal brioche, but in fact it was pain perdu, and a very good one at that. It came with salt caramel and peanut ice-cream. It was by far the best course.

In spite of the friendliness and proactivity of our server, we felt that overall service lacked the professionalism and confidence a place of this caliber requires.

The overall impression we had was that in spite of the elaborate descriptions and well-designed settings, the dishes fell short of our expectations. We asked ourselves how Tuju could have been rated a two-star.","1","","COUPLES","2018-06-30","2018-06-07","2018-06-07","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r585854760-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

We did the 12-course tasting and each course was beautifully presented. Every bite danced on your pallette. Ingredients were fresh. Unique flavors were expertly combined to compliment each other. Some of the highlights were: the frozen infused watermelon cubes with cucumber and buttermilk, manioc tortilla with smoked beets, crunchy chicken and the lychee with thyme cream was out of this world. Staff was attentive and knowledable and capable of describing dishes and wine in English. The seating and lighting could be improved for more ambience -- the seating was a little stiff and the lighting was a little too bright. Cocktails were also excellent, but the wait for them was a bit longer than it should have been. Pricing was typical for a tasting of this size and caliber. I was also impressed that they offered a shorter tasting menu should you choose not to go all in. Eating is a wonderful way to discover a city and Tuju helped give Sao Paulo five stars. I would put this place on your must-do list.","0","","COUPLES","2018-03-31","2018-03-08","2018-03-08","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r565284199-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"

We picked this place because it seemed really nice. 

It is nice but sooo overpriced for the ingredients. I cook ( not even close to a chef, just making a point about ingredients, complexity etc) and I felt the menu lacked the “wow” effect. 

Most of us chose the 12 course tasting menu. One couse was split pea soup. Come on!!!! 

The drinks were good, We were impressed by the mixology. Desset was ok.  The cachaça ice cream was really really good. But 400 for  just one good dessert and a good drink is too much in my opinion.

I recommend  going for the experience. Go with friends to enjoy, visit the vegetable and herb garden they hold on the top floor. 

I feel sad because it is not a place I would go again.","1","","FRIENDS","2018-03-31","2018-03-03","2018-03-03","en","Tuju","6958658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r564133078-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html"
