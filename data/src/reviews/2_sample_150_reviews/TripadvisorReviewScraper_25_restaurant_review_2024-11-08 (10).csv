Food: 4","Little gem tucked in a quiet corner of the town","We went on a Sunday evening and we were the only guests when we arrived.  The tables outside offered a view of a big grassy area surrounded by houses and a tree lined drive way.  

We had to transfer inside when it started to drizzle.  If the tables outside were very casual, the tables inside had starched white linen and napkins and very cozy ambiance.  Perfect for quiet dinners!

The food selection was very good.  I enjoyed the Kabeljauw.  The homemade dessert was a nice touch- given by the chef to us. :)

I wish I'd have another chance to visit this place again soon- and stay longer.  Just chill and savor the good vibe of the place.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/6e/fa/f6/the-drink-selection.jpg

Service is personal and friendly (one person when we were there, maybe the owner). Dinner was quite good, a plate with multiple small tasty bites for appetizer and excellent roasted-pepper soup. In took a very long time for that to arrive (more than an hour), the cooks seem overly relaxed (the kitchen is open). Apparently the idea is to offer a long and tranquil evening but we were hungry. A bit faster would be good. Anyway the rest went faster (white fish and tomato risotto, fish was 'acceptable', risotto excellent). Main coarse was quite good, beef), with plenty of hashbrowns and fries.

Yes there was a delicious dish of crayfish and also one with dry aged entrecote from the grill.  Still, the vegetable dishes stole the show. It started with preparations of red cabbage. A nice change of pickled, sorbet, powder and a rye cookie. The roasted beetroot in the fritter was so flavorful. Again different preparations of the same product but because of the difference in sweet, sour and bite this is a top dish. The visual presentation is very strong. And I never knew you could eat dahlia petals. 
The sommelier takes the wishes and taste pattern of me very well into account because I have indicated to be by car and want max 2 glasses during dinner. He asks well and therefore I am served a perfect white and red. What I also like about them is that they use local herbs, vegetables and flowers.  I ate some new ingredients (for me) like spirea and watermint. Very nice and a promise for a better sustainable future.

Each plate is even more beautiful, delicious and original than the other. Not to mention the enthusiasm and professionalism of the staff. Definitely recommended. And if you go, go all the way...including the wine pairing!!!","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-07-05","2024-07-05","en","Restaurant Lutum","3601999","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g652340-d3601999-r958101257-Restaurant_Lutum-Wijk_bij_Duurstede.html"

We found the prices very high for what we got. And the wines were unfortunately not our thing and that is of course possible. We wanted to stick to a few courses because of stomach reduction but were told that they did not participate. I didn't think this was social because it could also be said we are going to take it into account but unfortunately ... 

Unfortunately no new guests there. We wish you every success.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-07-31","2024-07-04","2024-07-04","en","Restaurant Lutum","3601999","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g652340-d3601999-r958019083-Restaurant_Lutum-Wijk_bij_Duurstede.html"
