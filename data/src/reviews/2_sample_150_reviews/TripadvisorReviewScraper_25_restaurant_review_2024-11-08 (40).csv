Staff amazing as usual. We actually came for lunch as opposed to dinner which was a nice change. We had the 7 courses and loved them all, me being a veggie I had a great selection. Extensive wine and cocktail menu. We finished the meal with a coffee and cigar in the cigar hut and had a look round the garden before being joined by Sat for a quick hello.

We opted for the 15 course tasting menu, with the Next Level wine flight. I cannot begin to describe how completely incredible the experience was. From the second that we checked into the hotel, we were met a level with warmth and welcoming unlike any other experience we’d ever had. Every single staff member that we came across were fantastic, I unfortunately don’t have the words to tell you how amazing they were. This continued throughout our stay, dinner, drinks and breakfast.

The suite we stayed in (room 7) was extremely relaxing, spotless clean and unbelievably luxurious. Every little detail was thought out to complement the stay. 

Now the food and wine… absolutely EXQUISITE. Every…single…thing. Worth every penny, 10 times over. You have to experience it yourself to understand.

Sat Bains even signed our menu and his new book for us!! We saw him a few times around the restaurant, always smiling and super friendly. 

We will treasure this experience for the rest of our lives, thank you to every one at Restaurant Sat Bains!!

Outstanding food and service!","From the moment we arrived to when we left we felt indulged and welcomed. A huge thank you to all the staff.  

We checked into our room and were given some beautiful treats, to have with a cup of tea and coffee (which we made in our room). 

The gardens were beautiful, herbs, fruit and veg growing everywhere. all the space was utilised. 

We had initially booked the 7 course taster menu. But upon our arrival for pre dinner drinks, Innes, the manager offered us a choice of 7, 10 or 15 courses.  He explained about all the options and even diminished my fears about the eels and sweetbread. He was right on both accounts. Absolutely delicious and not what I had expected. 

Natalia and Ed looked after us so well. Ed was our sommelier and Natalia was so wonderfully knowledgeable about our food they made our dining experience feel more unique.  This was a celebration to mark 25 years together but 21 years of marriage. 

Well what can I say about the food. We could see Sat Bains in the kitchen. His creative mind and food was beyond expectations. His mushroom tartlet was heaven in a mouthful and it topped the tartlet I previously had in a two Michelin star restaurant. 

The in the garden course was an immersive experience. Edward our chef enthralling with his knowledge and skills. Just brilliant!

Every dish was like a piece of art. Our 15 courses were served over 3 hours and my husband and I excitedly talked about every course.  If we could give this 5+ stars we absolutely would.  Thank you again for a wonderful experience. We hope to come back.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/0a/19/25/caption.jpg

All the staff are fantastic from the minute you walk through the door, you are treated by true professionals and you can see how passionate and proud they are to work at this amazing establishment.  The food was mind blowingly good, my husband has had the opportunity to eat in a lot of Michelin star restaurants over the years and he rated this as ‘the best meal I have ever eaten’.  Meghan and the pastry team were a joy to watch performing at the top of their game, and they all had fun.  

This is not a cheap meal, but as my husband says it is about cost versus value, our son loved every single morsel and will remember it for the rest of his life.  

Please go - you will not be disappointed - it is a fabulous evening!","2","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-18","2024-07-18","en","Restaurant Sat Bains","1192128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186356-d1192128-r960092742-Restaurant_Sat_Bains-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html"

A Summer Seven package including a 7 course Tasting menu, drinks, wine pairing for 1  (which we were able to share as we are not big drinkers), an overnight stay and breakfast for 2 the next morning. I can do no better than point out that the website descriptions of the food, wines, vegetable and herb gardens and service ethos proved utterly accurate.

What I can add, however, is that the service provided by the Tweed besuited team was a masterclass in relaxed, professional perfection both in word a deed. 

Theatrical? Absolutely. Enjoyable? Utterly. Immersive? Without doubt. Unforgettable? Yes. Would we do it again? Yes, but we’d have to save up. 

Is there something that could have been done better? Possibly, but we did not spot it on our visit.","1","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-07-12","2024-07-12","en","Restaurant Sat Bains","1192128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186356-d1192128-r959199581-Restaurant_Sat_Bains-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html"

The location was a surprise also. Being from Nottingham I am aware that that area is mainly a cigarette factory and industrial estate, however the moment you turn off onto Lenton Lane it was like being transported into the countryside. The staff were waiting for us at the door with a smile and welcoming greeting. We were escorted into the bar, after allowing to choose between there or the garden. Once sat, they brought a stool for my handbag, the bar menu and the wine BIBLE! A sommelier came to speak us thru the wines, then a restaurant manager came to talk us through the menu. We then were shown to our table and waiter for the evening. We had a surprise off menu courses which we got to watch being cooked in the garden. The whole meal was spectacular. I dont want to spoil anything but let's just say there was some flare with some courses. Very happy with the whole experience. And as I was there for my birthday I was given a signed menu from Sat B himself! Once we were back in the bar with our lemoncello, I managed to speak to the man himself to thank him for making my birthday perfect. 11/10!

Having never even been to a Michelin-star, I think going to this incredible 2 Star has completely spoilt me for future restaurant visits. The food was incredible, with a well-orchestrated sommelier and chefs presenting their own food created at the stations in a very calm kitchen. Each person at the top of their game. It was like watching a dance, with each station carefully putting together the dish; watching it was hypnotic. The sommelier was a great guy, they really knew the wine and how it paired with the food. I have never believed in wine pairing with food. Still, when he brought out a Gruner Veltliner (Austria), which initially tasted like 4-star petrol, however after he humoured my blunt remark, he told me to eat my dish. Then he returned to the wine (which was a different taste) so im not converted 10/10.

One of the dishes led us to a greenhouse where the young chef cooked garlic bread with a Cornish beer and the best (and oldest) parmesan i have ever had in front of us. this was a really nice touch explaining the ingredients and the sourcing of the food (provenance) 

I have never tasted food like it, it was perfection.

The bedroom for the night was basic and quite small, but in my view, the aim is to not be in your room unless you are sleeping, so it played a little part in the night. 

The breakfast was incredible. My wife ( having had 13 wines the night before) didn't turn up to breakfast, and any man worth his salt ordered his own 3-course breakfast as well as his wife's. It was the best 6-course breakfast I have ever eaten. 

Only 2 points of feedback re :

1. Sat Bains comes and meets you at the chef's table; I think he is happier in a gym (he looks like he's a Gym lad). He is quite a serious guy, I think cracking a smile only happens when he PBs on a bench (I joke). It would have been good to have met the head chef. 

2. Morning breakfast felt rushed—it almost felt like a checkout and off-you-go scenario (I didn't think we were that long, but I did have a food coma).

Overall it was a brilliant experience, and i can see why Sat Bains has a 2 star; they really deserve it","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/7f/55/1f/caption.jpg

Our last visit was with friends and family and sat at the privileged Chefs table watching the masters at work. extra treat the Boss was in !!!!
First time trying the new 3 course menu offered on the kitchen and chefs table , it was a definite 🙌 wow another winner for us. The dishes are sublime works of art with a masterclass in taste sensations .   Innes and the restaurant team are friendly professional and knowledgeable making the whole experience very special.    The gorgeous cigar hut with fire pit in the gardens is a great little addition to hangout for a coffee and liqueur.  This fabulous Restaurant with Rooms is a must for any foodie who appreciates fine food at its best topped with excellent service.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/ea/91/93/caption.jpg

Overall experience was underwhelming. Food was pretty average for a fine dining restaurant. Flavours were not memorable, and the use of gels was rather dated and added, neither texture nor flavour. Noise level was unacceptable. Certainly overpriced for moderate food.
The use of fake candles just sums it up. When questioned, the waiter explained that real candles were causing the walls to be stained. That was the worst untruth I have heard in a long time.
I'm not sure how they got their 2 stars, but I have dined in many not starred restaurants that severed better fare.
Will not be back and certainly not worth the money for mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, the food was not bad. It was just average and ordinary.
Disappointing.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/dc/fd/28/caption.jpg

From our initial greeting with Jorge, every member of staff was friendly knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. Innes, the restaurant manager, was extremely professional and our waiter, Tamas, was great too. The food was simply amazing. We've never dined at a restaurant before where every dish of a tasting menu was so memorable, distinctive and, most importantly, unbelievably delicious. Safe to say we will be returning very soon.

This time we opted for the 10 course tasting menu, and my wife had the wine pairing - which, she proclaimed, enhanced each dish perfectly.
As usual we discovered different dishes this time, such as venison and the squab pigeon (see photo)  which was absolutely delicious.  I was particularly pleased to see my favourite scallop dish on the menu!
The staff all go the extra mile to ensure that guests are made to feel welcome, and their friendly smiles go a long way to guaranteeing that.  Innes, the maitre d is a great asset to RSB and is always on hand to answer queries etc. in a friendly manner.

I was so excited to be dining here for lunch. After dining at many one star restaurants my imagination was going wild at what we’d be served. 
The hors d’ oeuvres were underwhelming, one was a jelly sweet smothered in sugar!
The bread was cold and was not fresh at all. The fish course was served on some sort of crust, this tasted stale. The fish itself did not of the texture of fish and was tasteless. As the dishes were brought out the more disappointed we became. Not one dish had a flavour explosion or brought any happiness. Not one dish seemed complete and everyone lacked something. As for the candy floss dessert, i tried, it failed not worth the calories. We paid the £440 bill for 2 and left speechless and hungry.
Giving this restaurant 2 Michelin stars is a license to print money.
If you’d like a Michelin experience half the price try Adams, Upstairs or even Simpsons in the midlands.

We had the 10 course tasting menu which was so filling .. we enjoyed all of the course but in particular I loved the potato course , the small soup on the first course and the scallop. My partner loved the fish main course . 
The bread and butter is also divine !!

On an industrial estate just outside Nottingham under pylons and a flyover.

Where do you go on your anniversary when your favourite restaurant is fully booked?
A little local we know that we've been going to for the last 25 years. 

When we arrived, the staff were all smiles and jovial.
It was like they were expecting us.
After drinking our complimentary glass of champagne, we were guided to our table.
Not in the dining room,oh no.
We were seated at the kitchen bench
After a few snacks, they led us to the greenhouse. 
What for?
A pizza 🍕 that's what for. 

After that , we were seated back in the kitchen to carry on with the rest of our lunch.
The food is sublime, and every dish is a taste sensation from this 2 Michelin Star restaurant.

As we were trying to leave, Sat insisted we took a copy of a magazine that they had actually put him on the front cover of.
Thank you to all the lovely staff for such an exceptional meal and service.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/e4/9b/8f/caption.jpg
