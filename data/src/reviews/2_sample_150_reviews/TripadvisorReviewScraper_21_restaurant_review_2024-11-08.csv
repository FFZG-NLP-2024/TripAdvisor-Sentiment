Atmosphere: 5","A very nice Saturday afternoon","A very nice Saturday afternoon, for sure. Our meeting with this wonderful restaurant happened yesterday, Saturday, February 17, 2024. It was lunch as part of our Valentine's Day, since due to work we couldn't go over the week when Valentine's Day was. I found out about the restaurant, as well as everything else that is offered at the KORAK family estate, while researching the Internet. I wanted to take my love to a beautiful place and I chose KORAK. I didn't make a mistake. And my love was very satisfied and happy. The restaurant has a Michelin star, so I thought they must be great. And they were. 

The restaurant is located on one of the hills of the Plješevica and offers a beautiful view of the surroundings. It is also the wine-growing region of Croatia with fine wines. I reserved a five-course menu. You can also reserve eight dishes menu, but these five were quite enough for the two of us. I must mention that you don't know what you ordered in those five courses, you just reserve the menu and everything that follows is a surprise. I think this is very interesting. The food from start to finish was phenomenal, imaginative, very tasty and beautifully arranged and served on plates. There was everything on our menu, from homemade cheese, homemade prosciutto, homemade butter in beeswax, homemade bread that is made in a special way, all the way to dishes like tortellini in a fine sauce with grated black truffle (which the staff grates in front of you). , lamb brisket with chickpeas, beautifully prepared squab with home-made grated horseradish and steamed shallots with plums, and a delicious even slightly salty caramel ice cream with toppings.....and some other interesting elements of our menu.  Everything was very tasty, beautiful to see and imaginative. For the first time in our life, my love and I ate sguab and it was nice and tasty, in fact we were positively surprised. The staff told us that they change the menu all the time, so if we come back a few more times, and we might from what we've seen, we'll eat some other food. Very interesting. 

I have to praise the staff as well. They were very professional, polite and smiling, which is very important for a restaurant of this type. Each plate they brought us, that is, each course, was presented to us in an excellent way. They described to us what we were eating, how each element of the meal was prepared, with what technique, etc. Also their drinks that we drank, which was Chardonnay white wine and, at the very beginning, home-made apple cognac we also liked the staff gave information about where they came from, how everything was done, etc. 

In the end, my recommendation if you are looking for a very nice place with great food and drinks. For the chef Mr. Korak and his staff all the praises and may they continue at the same pace. Maybe another Michelin star will come soon.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/73/ee/8c/caption.jpg

We started our visit in the afternoon with a wine tasting of 5 of their wines with a very nice snack platter and a visit to their cellar. After that, we walked around in the small village for a bit before starting our dinner. We went for 5 courses with 1 Korak wine pairing and 1 regional wine pairing. The food was original and local and very nice and the host and staff were very friendly and professional. The vineyard and restaurant are family owned and the family still runs both - the daughter of the family was the host, one of the sons is the chef, the grandma still helps in the kitchen and the father & another son run the winery. The restaurant is only 45 mins away from Zagreb and we stayed in a very nice guesthouse at 5 mins walking distance (Rezekov) to be able to fully enjoy the wine and getting home safely :) Highly recommended!","0","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-27","2023-10-27","en","Korak Winery","21054079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r923150396-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html"

The food experience is not  memorable, out of 5 dishes, two were good, mostly the pigeon, the others 3 really basic.  
Instead, wines are are tasty and lovely.
Overall experience is not worth the money paid, service is gentle but far away from Michelin starred restaurant (very often the glass have been left empty for long)

One important thing is that this restaurant has almost zero food waste policy. We took 8 sequence meals and it was 3hrs of taste rapsody and enjoying the food and the story of each plate. The chef created such a crazy combination of tastes but still remained authentic to traditional cousine. The dinner was really really abondant and we were full by the desert. Nex time I will go slowly with the bread but since it was the best bread in the entire world I am not sure if one can avoid eating it. Each meal was accompanied by a story and a glass of wine, selected to match the meal. We ended up buying 4 bottles as the wine was amazing, so tasty, rich and easy to drink (yes, after 8 glassis of wine we were slightly drunk, but happy).

If they want to be a ""star"" restaurant: the food is delicious, almost there. They can work on service a bit more. The interior decorations and furniture are very nice. Need to work on the lights.
But most important you can not have a group of way too loud guests in a ""star"" restaurant because everybody else is suffering.

If they want to be a wine-tasting bar they have it all. Nice wines, great views, and professional staff.
They just need to drop a tasting menu and prepare a few local dishes that would work perfectly with wine tasting.

Once someone at ""Korak"" decides what they want to be I honestly believe that will be a great place to visit.
The message they are sending out now just doesn't reflect reality.","0","","NONE","2023-02-28","2023-02-05","2023-02-05","en","Korak Winery","21054079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r877561396-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html"

It's a beautiful environment.  Gorgeous views overlooking the countryside.  The hosts were friendly and accommodating.  The charcuterie plate was loaded up with a variety of delicious meets, cheeses, breads, butter, spreads etc.  There was lots there to enjoy and all of it either home-made or artisanal.

I'm not a big fan of Croatian wines.  They had a decent Syrah and Sauv Blanc.  A sparkling pinot noir and chardonnay (I've never had sparkling chardonnay before) and another one that I can't recall.  As far as Croatian wines go they were good but like I said - I don't much care for Croatian wines.

I've had very high expectations coming in, but the whole experience completely blew me away.

Eating at Kokrak's is just that, experience, you simply cannot compare it to going to a regular restaurant, it is on a par with what you'd expect of an extremely good fine-dining restaurant :)

Every dish out of an 8-course menu was, without any exaggeration, the best thing I've eaten. If I had to pick the best, I'd have to settle for 2, the smoked trout  (because I *really* don't like eating fish, and this was amazing)  and Tortellini (because they are my favorite dish,  ever since my childhood and these were best I've eaten. Ever. By far 😁)

I've been enjoying Korak's wines for some time now, and their Pinot  Noir is one of my favorite wines, so awesome wines, paired with mind-blowing food, in modern yet homey abience is the experience I'll definitely remember for the rest of my life :)","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/df/37/93/korak-winery.jpg","NONE","2021-04-30","2021-04-17","2021-04-17","en","Korak Winery","21054079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r786694517-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html"

One bottle instead of 190 kn charged 400!

Unfortunately our expectations was not met .
Food was nice and with local twist,  but far away for real fine dining level .
To make things worse, guests are a mix of fine Diners ( who pay a quite expensive price ) and people just passing by for sharing a bottle of wine. Please decide if you want fine dining or Winebar / klet.

Wines nice as always , but dinner for sure not worth the price","1","","COUPLES","2020-07-31","2020-07-19","2020-07-19","en","Korak Winery","21054079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r760675636-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html"

The view alone is wonderful, but it shouldn't distract from the great food. Add the right wines from the winery and the whole thing is well-rounded and simply delicious! Despite the Michelin star, the price-performance ratio is very good and reasonable. The trip up the mountain is definitely worth it for connoisseurs.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/85/e5/10/caption.jpg

The kitchen did not deserve a Michelin star, and neither did the service. The only thing that deserves my praise is the view and the vintage wines because they are excellent. Over 250 euros per person (dish + wine) is far too much for what we got. If you are not looking for a meal but just a wine tasting, then it might be acceptable.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2024-01-02","2024-01-02","en","Korak Winery","21054079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r932037909-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html"
