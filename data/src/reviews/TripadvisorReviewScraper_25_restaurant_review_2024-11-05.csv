Atmosphere: 2","Disappointing after such a long wait","We had looked forward to coming to this restaurant for so long, that perhaps our expectations were unreasonably high.  The room is very plain and ‘ordinary’, not beautiful or remarkable in any way as I would normally expect a restaurant with three stars to be.  Similarly with the table service, plates, cutlery, etc.  The food itself was fascinating … the presentation, the minute detail with which it had obviously been prepared, the use of herbs and plants.  But did it taste good …. for us, no.  Perhaps our palates aren’t sufficiently well tuned, but each dish was insufficiently differentiated from the last and I like to finish my meal with something sweet.  Judging by the stars and the reviews, my husband and I are clearly in the minority, but I guess it’s all a matter of taste.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-09-28","2024-09-28","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r971697273-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

My brother, Karl saw the Netflix show ""The chef's Table"" and told us all about it. We having been trying to go for the past several years and this is the first time we were able to go. 
I won't bore you with the details of what we ate only to say it was the most amazing meal we have ever eaten and we are real foodies. We will be back. Make reservations as soon as you make your airplane reservation because it is a tiny restaurant.

Food: 5","Just as good as ever!","This was our fifth visit to La Marine - no trip to France is now complete without coming here. We had the 6-course menu but that's a bit misleading because there were no fewer than 8 amuses-bouches and 5 petits fours! 
The former included the famous Noirmoutier potatoes, squid, radish, smoked mullett, creme de menthe with cucumber, delicious truffle fish balls with a coffee centre which melt in the mouth, clam consommé and, believe it or not, fennel cream with cheese ice cream, strawberry sauce and mackerel. Now we are ready to start the meal proper!
First was oysters from the boat 'Erika' with a squid sauce, then white asparagus with embers of pine cones, then hake with cherry and green beans and almond milk. Whiting followed and then 'Bois de la Chaize' with elements representing the woods on the island - and finally a lovely rhubarb dessert. 
We had the wine flight to accompany all this - a muscadet de sevre et maine, a Cotes de Duras, a Macon Chaintré, a Côtes du Rhône and finally a local Vendée sweet wine. 
Alexandre Couillon is so creative, mixing old favourites and completely new dishes and the staff led by Céline are so friendly, helpful and informal that the whole experience is a joy.   Thank you as usual to all concerned! 
We were here 7th June 2019.","6","","COUPLES","2019-06-30","2019-06-16","2019-06-16","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r681847657-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

Food: 5","One to remember","Definitely an experience to savour. 5 or 6 hors d' oeuvres before the 6  course lunch that the chef created a story and experience with. There were some memorable dishes and flavours. Foremost in my mind, the little dish of carrot ginger and winkle. For my son who dined with me, the hake and carrot dish. Forgettable for me was the initial dish of potato done 3 ways and the radish with a pine sauce, the freshness and fieryness of the radish destroyed the surprisingly delicate flavour of the pine sap sauce. The whiting dish was just a little too delicate. The hake dish though excellent and the chocolate dessert memorable. The little sweets with coffee were another dessert in themselves, with the return of carrot and ginger but in dessert form. Also a memorable beetroot and aniseed biscuit. 

Definitely a meal to remember. The Chef/Owner kindly brought my son into the kitchen as he is interested in cooking.","1","","FAMILY","2019-04-30","2019-05-06","2019-05-06","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r671824718-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

Food: 5","One of the best restaurants anywhere","It was La Marine that introduced us to Michelin-starred restaurants a number of years ago. We have been to quite a few since but, as we return here for the fourth time, its combination of superb food, lovely staff and excellent value are hard to beat.
We were given a warm welcome and shown to a table by the window. The menu here gives no choice - except the number of courses! We chose the six-course one (we could have had 9) but that is very misleading because, no sooner have you made your decision, the amuses-bouches start to arrive - six of them but two of them were trios. The first is the signature dish of Noirmoutier potatoes - one made into an ice-cream, one a 'crisp' and the third a warm soup - the perfect strat to what will be a perfect meal. Then followed a sardine dish, smoked mackerel, a clam on a biscuit, an amazing hot mackerel ball with coffee (that sounds very odd but, believe you me, it explodes with flavour in the mouth!), then another trio, the first: strawberry and pepper soup with cheese ice cream, then tomato with sweet and sour sauce with crab and finally leak and onion soup. All this accompanied by lovely bread, one made with seaweed with two sorts of butter, one of them also made with seaweed.
Now for the first course! Raw young tuna with petits pois and raspberries.
Course 2: a huge barbecued white asparagus in a pine-cone sauce and (we think!) salmon roe.
Course 3:  A filet of whiting with cherries and samphire and an almond sauce.
Course 4: breast of Challans duck with condiments from the Marine garden
The last two courses were fine desserts, an ice cream made with smoked milk and lastly, 'a walk in the woods' (you just have to experience it!). 
The portions here are generous and we have to admit that we were unable to finish the petits-fours.
We chose to accompany all this with the sommelier's choice of wines and enjoyed generous glasses of a 2016 Sevre et Maine, a 2017 Cote de Catalan, a 2016 Toulouse wine (La Colombiere), a lovely Val de Loire red and lastly a dessert wine from Anjou.
The bill came to 372 euros including two cocktails maison, two coffees and one Armagnac. This is a lot of money but extremely good value for a restaurant of this outstanding quality - we have paid more in one-star places in Britain. 
We arrived at 19.30 and left at 23.00 having had another mind-blowingly memorable culinary experience. Céline Couillon and her team make everything work so smoothly and are informal and informative. Alexandre Couillon is simply a master of his trade. 
We were here 15th June 2018 and we will be back - we say that every time but we mean it! Many thanks to all concerned.","8","","COUPLES","2018-06-30","2018-06-17","2018-06-17","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r588017989-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

Food: 5","Delightful","Dined here recently and can only recommend this amazing restaurant.
The menu of which you may chose a standard version with 6 courses or an extended version with 3 additional courses is certainly not the cheapest and there is no a la carte option but every morsel you are going to enjoy is worth a trip to this beautiful place. Set in a ancient fisherman's house on the port basin of l'Herbaudiere in Noirmoutier right opposite the Wholesale Fish Market. The island has a reputation for its Bonnotte Potato and Crystal sea salt. 
The seasonal Menu is preceded by 6 hot and cold amuse-bouches, home-made bread using beer-yeast accompanied by simply: seaweed-butter. It is probably the best bread I have ever tasted, a slight taste of sea, a great fluffy but firm texture and an amazing crust. 
Using only seasonal veggies from the restaurants own kitchen-garden local fish from the neighbouring fishery and the famous poultry from Challans, the chef respects the four seasons, guarantees 1st class freshness and avoids long supply chains. The chef's creations were not exaggerated, no crazy combinations and a matching glass of wine for each course made me swing through the menu with joy and pleasure. Highlight was the Poulet a la Mue de Vendee (a Chicken fed with cows milk and toast for 2 weeks) accompanied by Langoustine and Parsnip. There is certainly lots to tell about his deserts.: one if them combines Mushroom, Celeriac and Honey (own production) as a desert - just amazing.  
There are not many tables here so making a reservation well ahead is recommended, especially during high season.","7","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/f8/8a/83/scallops-beetroot-parsley.jpg

Food: 5","The best meal experience ever!","We spend an incredible evening at la Marine, the best dinner experience I have ever had. We went for the full menu of 9 courses and did not regret it: it was a fire work of cooking at its very best. It all started with 6 amazing amuse-bouche that indicated what this crew can do, and each of the nine courses were truly a piece of art in presentation, texture and taste. The excellent sommelier had put together the perfect wine package that I also recommend, and service was of course impeccable. 

I have nothing negative to say, this experience will stay with us for a long time, but a few tips for future visitors:
* When asked about an aperitif, say yes, otherwise you will only have water to accompany the lovely amuse-bouche. Champagne worked great for us :)
* I strongly recommend a stay at the next door Maison Moizeau, also run by the Couillon family, and therefore the same quality and attention to detail (and opened its gates in July 2017(
* If you stay at the hotel, pay extra for breakfast. It is a great experience as it is Alexandre Couillons attempt at recreating his grandfathers fisherman breakfast.

My only regret is that there aren't six or seven star ratings at Trip Advisor.","7","","FAMILY","2017-07-31","2017-07-28","2017-07-28","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r506436643-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

I cannot recommend it highly enough. Each dish was an adventure in creativity, beauty and taste ... the numerous amuse bouche set the stage and the meal continued a great gastronomic adventure. The course of the evening was a wonderful desert of pine ice cream on a seaweed biscuit with sprinkles of chocolate and other sweets. Lovely!

Go ... You will not be disappointed!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/a7/5b/91/photo0jpg.jpg

After taking a long drive all the way from Bordeaux, we arrived at the restaurant thirsty and hungry. We ordered the no 1 menu, which consisted of two starters, two mains and two desserts. Every dish, including the mouth amusers, was perfectly cooked and blew my mind. The Erika oyster was the largest and freshest I have ever seen, and it tasted so delicious with the squid ink marinate, layer of sugar and the powdered bacon. 

This review would be too long if I were to describe all the dishes, but some other highlights were the barbecued asparagus, the tender duck, and the smoked milk ice cream. 

For anyone wishing to experience mind blowing seafood dishes, this is the restaurant to visit. Wouldn't be surprised if it obtained a third michelin star soon.","4","","FRIENDS","2017-05-31","2017-05-16","2017-05-16","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r484716172-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

We booked our table 2 months in advance, though it appeared to be quite full already.

The restaurant is small, with five tables set up in a cosy setting. We ordered the 6-course menu, partially for the famous ""Erika"" oyster, and so began the amazing lunch experience that was started with an additional 6 welcome dishes before the first starter dish came. We sat through three hours of a delightful food journey, ranging from perfectly barbecued asparagus, to the famous shapeless Erika oyster, and to the lovely mains of fish and duck that were cooked to ultimate perfection.

The experience was topped off with meeting with Alexandre Couillon himself, who was visibly busy from the kitchen work, but was happy to take a photo with these eager tourists and showed us the exquisite fireplace that was one of the opening scenes in the episode, and was also used to smoke one of their ice cream desserts.

We left the restaurant yearning for more - this was by far the greatest highlight of our trip to France, on an otherwise remote island of Noirmoutier.","5","","FRIENDS","2017-05-31","2017-05-14","2017-05-14","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r484176725-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

The outside is quite unprepossessing but one immediately gets taken up a level in the reception. 

We had decided as we had eventually booked and arrived there we would have the 9 course menu with matched wine.

My wife and I had a debate about a glass of champagne as an apéro. We decided against it as we have found some restaurants can overdo the quantity of wine served ( yes I know you don't have to drink it all!). 

I think in retrospect it was a mistake as it would have been perfect with the exquisite canapés, there was one truffles like one with mackerel and coffee that was perfect.

I won't describe every course but for me there were two highlights. L'huître Noire, I generally think chefs cannot improve oysters but this dish was superb. The other course I really enjoyed was The Pintade it was without doubt the most tender, perfectly prepared and served guinea-fowl I've ever had. 

The wines were not grand wines but the matching as one would expect worked. There was a local focus on the which included Muscadet and a Pinot Noir from Brem. I did find the Côtés de Jura both novel and interesting as I was unaware of it. 

I mentioned that it's unpretentious it's a smallish restaurant, my wife and I were in the catch all 'smart casual' other diners also but at either end of the definition. The staff were really relaxed there was not the question 'are you enjoying it' after every mouthful and they did not hover. They were friendly and happy to engage in conversation about the food. Other Michelin restaurants could learn from them.

Of course we are going back.","4","","COUPLES","2017-05-31","2017-05-10","2017-05-10","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r483203903-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"

A choice between a menu of 6 or 9 dishes. Because one is plied with numerous amuse-bouche even before the ""real thing"" starts, the 6 menu is just perfect. But the 9 dish menu is also terribly tempting (lobster!). Staff is charming and very attentive. They were very accommodating to one in our party who was pregnant and couldn't eat raw fish. They whipped up langoustines for her, in place of the oyster for example. 
The only thing amiss was that the chef didn't come out of the kitchen to go round the tables, when it is a very small restaurant et cosy. It would have been lovely to congratulate him in person. The decor was also maybe a bit modern for my taste.","3","","FAMILY","2017-04-30","2017-04-24","2017-04-24","en","La Marine","942593","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g425088-d942593-r478638560-La_Marine-Noirmoutier_en_l_Ile_Ile_de_Noirmoutier_Vendee_Pays_de_la_Loire.html"
