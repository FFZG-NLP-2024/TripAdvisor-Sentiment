Atmosphere: 5","Wonderful spot","This was by far our best meal in Slovenia (thus far). It was a cold, blustery night so everyone was indoors. We were seated in the little cabin area and it was cozy and warm. The entire place was full of patrons and the team handled it very well. They managed to stay attentive and we had our wine in hand and order in rather quickly.

The food was splendid. We had the house salad which was delicious and unique. We had the Sicilian potatoes, so very good. Potatoes cooked perfectly. Then polenta raddichio mushroom dish was the topper. The flavors blended perfectly. Heaven. The mushroom soup was just ok. 

Highly recommend this place. We wished we could have gone back a second night but they were closed on Wed. Well deserved night off!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-21","2024-09-20","en","Okrepčevalnica Lačni Kekec","10628042","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r970645882-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

What about: the environment is great both indoors and outdoors, the waiters are focused, fast and professional.
The menu is very varied with a predilection for grilling, we order a grilled meat for 2 and we get a wooden board of one meter full of fat and vegetables, a spectacle.
The dish was for 3 but also 4 people would eat there, my son took the BBQ ribs and came a strip of 40cm, huge.
Beers of many kinds, excellent final coffee kill (Slivovitz) and adequate price.
I hope one day to return.","0","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-28","2024-08-28","en","Okrepčevalnica Lačni Kekec","10628042","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r967252463-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

we arrived  at 7.30 PM and the waiter was upset since we where the only costumers and was in a hurry to close even if it was clearly written that the restaurant was open till 10 PM. he started beeing very unpolite and also bring the wrong order ( i ordered a rib-eye steak and got a  normal steak. when I told him the the order was wrong he did not care. He pushed us to go away in all possible manners, complaining all the time in a very rude way. The food was below average and with high price. We exited at 8.30 PM while he was screming against us something in slovenian. Not the best hospitality! NEVER AGAIN!","0","","BUSINESS","2024-03-31","2024-03-20","2024-03-20","en","Okrepčevalnica Lačni Kekec","10628042","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r943076220-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

Atmosphere: 4","good ol´Kekec  :-)","The place is already pretty famous and wellknown to us, so we decided to visit it again and have a lunch overthere. Since the Winter is already over, or should I say, Winter didn´t even arrive, the place is somehow incomplete and we missed the real feel. 
We were pretty hungry, so we ordered roasted veal and pork under the bell for the three of us and one wiener schnittzel. We had a glass of some good craft beer and waited for the food to come for some 20 minutes. The guy which served us was really eager, kind, polite and willing to help. So the food finally arrived and looked OK on that big wooden plate. Also smelled good. We started and within just a few minutes our bellies were well filled. So, everything was well prepared, but every piece of meat was unfortunately missing something. I mean, all four of us commented that the meat was missing a bit of salt and other seasoning like grounded pepper, garlic etc... There was also one piece of meat which did not belonged here, because it was too lean and dry, so the seasoning and cooking technique did not do the thing, as it should. All in all, we had quite a good time, we did not finish the food, because the portions are too big, even for us hungry ""wolves"". The price for what we had is more than OK too. So the bottom line, we will give grade to the Kekec guys 4 of 5. It is good, but can be more than good with just a few extra kicks.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/a8/a5/f9/caption.jpg","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-18","2024-03-18","en","Okrepčevalnica Lačni Kekec","10628042","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r942782199-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html"

Recommend all the dishes we had and were all a 5 out of 5. They like to serve the different meat dishes on a board for the table which is a great way to share and try everything
- Goulash (delicious and of a good size for 1 
- Pork Knuckle (watch out as there’s more than one)
- mixed meat platter for 2 (v big and could be enough for 3/4 depending on appetites)
- chicken skewers were perfect to share with our little one
- homemade sausages very tasty and served in flatbread.
-  spit roasted piglet - again large but delicious 

Even the fries (butterflied wedges) and salad we ordered on the side were fantastic.

It’s best to call in during your stay to reserve a table as it’s very popular","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/73/03/84/caption.jpg
