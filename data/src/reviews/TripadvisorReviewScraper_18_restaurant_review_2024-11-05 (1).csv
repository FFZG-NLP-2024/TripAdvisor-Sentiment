Atmosphere: 5","A Great Reason to Overnight in Basel","Dinner at Roots was one of the highlights of our vacation in Switzerland.  We opted for the full tasting menu with wine pairings and enjoyed every minute of our 3.5 hour meal!  Incredibly creative taste combinations and expertly paired wines with each course, all explained in detail by staff members who truly enjoy their jobs - not to mention a great conversation with the Chef himself!  We made a point of staying overnight in Basel to experience Roots and are glad we did.  The restaurant will be moving to a more intimate location in the city and I can only imagine that it will achieve its third Michelin start after the move.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-25","2024-09-25","en","Roots","12854615","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188049-d12854615-r971364024-Roots-Basel.html"

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated with personal, efficient service, excellent food and delicious wines.

There was a handwritten note (with our names) on our table to welcome us and the first drinks arrived exactly on time!  There is no a la carte menu, rather a menu surprise  and you have the option of choosing 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 courses - we chose 6.

Every course was just the right sized portion, delicious and exquisitely presented.  The explanations were provided at each time and the staff were perfect.  The restaurant is on the riverside and the view is ever changing.

I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant - as long as there is still a place for us to return!","0","","NONE","2022-08-31","2022-08-20","2022-08-20","en","Roots","12854615","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188049-d12854615-r855264246-Roots-Basel.html"

Despite that I was informed via email a few hours before the dinner that paper certificates are accepted we were not allowed to enter the restaurant with our colleague from the US who just recently had his third booster vaccine shot from Pfizer and clearly could prove his vaccination status via paper certificate as is common practice in the US. 
Instead we were sent to an HIV test center in town for Covid testing. Maybe one just needs any sort of negative test as long as it’s attached to a QR code? 
Anyway our group got split into several parties which was very disappointing. 
Please do not go to this restaurant with guests holding paper certificates only, it’s just an endless waste of your time. Dreadful!","3","","BUSINESS","2021-11-30","2021-11-25","2021-11-25","en","Roots","12854615","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188049-d12854615-r820052585-Roots-Basel.html"

What Pascal Steffen and his team do every day is simply top.

Our 10 course menu with wine accompaniment (with and without alcohol) was an experience in itself... 

The Roots vegetable garden is a taste experience with around 30 different vegetables. 

The trout with broccoli was perfectly cooked, couldn't be better!

Risotto with corn - once different!!

The main course with the quail and kohlrabi, along with the ingenious sauce, which had power and a lot of deep, was just awesome. A huge leap too soon! 

The dessert creations, whether with zucchetti, olive oil or fruity, were the perfect conclusion.

The whole thing was rounded off by the warm and perfect service team. 

We will definitely come back.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/25/ed/29/caption.jpg

The service accompanies the high-quality kitchen at the front with a lot of warmth and expertise.

The wine and non-alcoholic accompaniment to the individual dishes harmonized perfectly.
