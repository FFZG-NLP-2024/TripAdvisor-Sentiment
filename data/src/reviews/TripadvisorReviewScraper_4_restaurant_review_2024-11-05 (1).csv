Atmosphere: 3","Nice food but not impressive","We had read wonderful reviews of this place. The location, and service deserve five stars. The first part of the meal was good and some dishes were original. Towards the end we were not impressed. There were several repetitions like bamboo sprouts in two or three dishes. In Europe this would be strongly forbidden in a formal dinner. The use of local herbs is interesting but most of these herbs exist and are used in traditional Italian cooking. For example in Sicily. Nice food but honestly not impressive.","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-03-18","2024-03-17","en","Miyamasou","6901549","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d6901549-r942731665-Miyamasou-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Or have your dinner first! No food served! You will leave hungry! A disgrace!

Though be warned the rooms aren't the most comfortable if you like a bit of slouch. I longed for a cozy sofa facing the view as I read my book. The food is spectacular. Wholly seasonal and local - we got boar and bear at our dinner- and there is a real connection to nature. Ginkgo nuts in miso, subtle soft broths with radish, a sublime final rice fish cooked with thin discs of some kind of tuber. It was delicate, delicious and original. We ate at kikunoi two days before and the food there felt soulless and inauthentic in comparison. Post dinner they make a fine bed - fluffy duvet, hot water bottles, crisp linen.  It's pricey but remarkable. I want to return in other seasons now","4","","COUPLES","2014-12-31","2015-01-06","2015-01-06","en","Miyamasou","6901549","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d6901549-r247784858-Miyamasou-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

We were served in a dining room with a private bathroom and views of the river.
The service was magnificent and the food of the highest quality.
