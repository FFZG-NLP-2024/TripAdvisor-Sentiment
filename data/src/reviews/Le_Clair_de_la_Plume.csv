Today I had the pleasure of having lunch at the Clair de la Plume table, and I must say that the chef is simply fabulous! 

Jean-Luc, the property owner, shared this exceptional moment with us, and had discovered his entire menu.

We had the chance to share this moment with Tomas Feier co-president of the Tourist Office of Grignan and Owner of the Bastide of Grignan. Quil was able to transform with the help of Christopher, and this is felt in every detail.

What a pleasure to see so much energy deployed for their territory! Their commitment to promoting local know-how and understanding the social and societal impacts of Things to do is truly inspiring. 

Many thanks to the whole team for this memorable moment! 🍽️✨ #Grignan #Gastronomy #LocalKnow-How #SustainableTourism","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/79/4d/b2/caption.jpg

I've been coming here for years, and each time the experience gets better and better.  The original hotel with it's elegant rooms and beautiful gardens make you feel transported to another world, and the new addition and renovation of the old farmhouse Chapouton which is only a few minutes walk is another creation extraordinaire! The two restaurants - the Bistro (SO great!) and the Michelin star restaurant  (Which is beyond AMAZING and should definitely be on your bucket list!!) is only surpassed by the hotel staff. They are so kind and professional and always there to make sure your experience is one to remember. So many hotels strive for excellence, but this one truly delivers, and I look forward to next year's visit!!

The first word I could give is lunar because it was an experience outside of time in weightlessness in this magnificent setting where the magic worked because all the people who welcomed us made sure that our stay was exceptional.

On Saturday evening when we arrived for the night we were in the hotel which is a very well maintained architectural building of character.
The private Chanoine room where we slept was comfortable, very good bedding and tasteful decoration.

The staff is quality, and intentional through their service and remains attentive and available with a breakfast which brightened our morning nothing to complain about just thank them.

Saturday evening: let's talk about the restaurant La Ferme du Chapouton, in continuation of the service received by the hotel the welcome was impeccable as well as the service, but let's talk about the culinary part being a fine gastronomic critic I discovered a culinary journey including the emotions still remain anchored on my taste buds hats off to the cooked.

On Sunday lunchtime we went to the winegrowers' café, this summer I find nice but a little more in a classic standard than the rest of the previous services even if we were well received and well eaten and a good wine tasting but that does not correspond no personal opinion on the services received in the two descriptions above concerning the hotel and the restaurant of the Chapouton farm.

We will definitely come back, best regards Mr Rousselet

Service: 5","A very nice discovery","Without the gift from a friend “Les Collectors”, we probably would not have discovered this magical place less than an hour from home.
Yes, the lively and historic village of Grignan is charming, yes the place (by the light of the pen) its suite, its breakfast, its rooms are welcoming, yes its staff takes great care, yes the meal at the Bistrot de la ferme chapouton is masterful...
In short, nothing to say, or rather nothing to complain about, except that we will come back.

Fruit and water on arrival in the impeccably clean and tastefully decorated room. Possibility to unload your luggage and then park the car in private parking. Evening room service. Swimming pools a little far from the hotel. Nice natural swimming pool but too many mosquitoes with pretty gardens. Swimming pool dubresyaurznt heated but quite cramped. Towels available. Fresh fruit every day in the room.
The only downside would be the breakfast charged at 25 euros which does not offer fried eggs but only scrambled eggs. That's a bit of an exaggeration.
Very pleasant and attentive staff
Very nice hotel at a high price, pleasant for 2 to 3 days.","0","","COUPLES","2023-09-30","2023-09-24","2023-09-24","en","Le Clair de la Plume","482084","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g445033-d482084-r918196311-Le_Clair_de_la_Plume-Grignan_Drome_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"
