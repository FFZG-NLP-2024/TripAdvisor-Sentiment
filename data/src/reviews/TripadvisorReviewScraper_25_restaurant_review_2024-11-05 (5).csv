You can not find better in the area for a romantic dinner or business lunch. The wine list is incredible and recommend to ask for advice. The quality of the food deserves at least 2 michelin stars and i would give it a good 17 out of 20 in the gault millaud. It seems difficult to find but not really. It is only 10 minutes from the motorway and a good gps will find it. This family run business is the proof that some people still respect good produce and know how to cook it. Price wise it is more than affordable and well worth the trip.

Food: 5","Excellent food, cosy atmosphere, great service","This one-star restaurant deserves a visit, but you need to find your way there as it is located in the countryside at the crossing of Campania, Apulia and Basilicata, 15 minutes drive from the motorway exit (Vallata). The food is, expectedly, excellent and innovative, though deeply rooted in traditions (carpaccio, coffee risotto, ravioli with burrata cheese are absolutely a must). We chose the tasting menu, in order to have a feel of the chef's skills, but you can order a' la carte. The atmosphere is warm and cosy and the praise-worthy service discrete. The price is fair and affordable considering that it is a starred restaurant. We will go back!","0","","FRIENDS","2017-03-31","2017-03-17","2017-03-17","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r468140123-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"

It was just superb. Wonderful service and delicious food. We had the menu which started with two different soups, then pasta, then main, then two desserts. The ravioli was really good. I was probably a little under-dressed in jeans but was made to feel very welcome. The head waiter had excellent English and explained all the dishes for us. It is well worth the diversion from the autostrada.

Wife and I with my 88-year-old dad stopped on way to small Avellino village on genealogy tour after arriving in Naples airport – about 1 hour out of way, and would go again in a heartbeat.  Prosecco and ethereal Zucchini Blossoms, house made bread perhaps best in Italy, house made onion enhanced bread sticks, mixed platter (house made ricotta fresca, local meats), all house made pastas (burrata ravioli with local black truffles, laccettini with white ragout of rosemary and rabbit), roasted pig on white eggplant base, pre-desert and desert, all with local Fianno di Avellino wine.
Terrific food and service.  A memorable dining experience – best we had in our week through Campania – including Capri and Sorrento/ Amalfi coast.  Wanting to return.
One recommendation for non-Italian speakers out there – download & translate menu; second is use GPS/ 1phone.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/a3/f7/85/zucchini-blossoms.jpg","FRIENDS","2013-09-30","2013-10-06","2013-10-06","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r179976185-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"

Atmosphere: 5","A Dream....A Hidden Gem","Whenever I visit the region of 'Campania' in Italy I always make a point of a special journey to Oasis Sapori Antichi for either lunch or dinner. 
Forget any fine dining experience you've had in the past (and I've had a few all over the world), in my humble opinion these guys are 'Simply the Best'!
Their taster menu with wine is a delightful gastranomic journey of the locality employing the finest locally sourced produce prepared and executed with passion and an uncompromising level of attention to detail. I can't speak highly enough of this establishment as they easily put other restaurants of much higher acclaim to complete shame.
From the welcome to the service to the in-depth explanations of the dishes and the charming attitude and elegance of the owners it can only be described as a dreamy experience which I hope to repeat many more times again before the good Lord calls me to rest.
I can think of no other place that checks if the timings between courses are acceptable and when the owner said to me 'consider yourself at home' I nearly fell off my rather splendid chair.
Well done to the owners for creating such a wonderful and inspirational dining experience in the middle of nowhere which is nothing short of 'GENIUS'. Thank you.","4","","FAMILY","2011-12-31","2012-02-20","2012-02-20","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r124860582-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Oasis Sapori Antichi-Well Worth a Stop","During the past couple of years many travel and gastronomic magazines have been praising the southern Italian region of Puglia-the heel of the boot--as the ""second Tuscany"". While especially nice for its delicious food and lovely beaches, Puglia is off the beaten track of Rome, Florence, and Venice, and not easily accessible by air except to Bari.  In fact the best way to get there is by car from Rome or Naples.  The drive from Rome to Bari takes approximately five hours and from Naples on A 16 autostrada about half that.  Moreover, you will need a car once you've arrived in Puglia.
 A special place to break the trip is for lunch at ""Oasis Antichi Sapori"", owned and run by the extremely hospitable Fischetti family, in Vallesacarda.  To reach this special destination, exit the autostrada at Vallata, go uphill to the stop sign, turn left and go  straight for c. 6 kilometers or c. 4 miles until the sign for Vallesacarda where you turn right and go downhill until ""Oasis Antichi Sapori which will be on your left.
Vallesacarda is an ugly  town but elegant, peaceful and very reasonably-priced ""Oasis Antichi Sapori"" lives up to its name. It was recommended to me by food writer Faith Willinger who is an expert when it comes to Italian cuisine.  Most of the dishes, including the ice creams, are made inhouse.  Mamma Giuseppina and sisters Maria Luisa and Michelina are in the kitchen.  Younger brothers Carmine, Puccio, and Nicola serve their creations and recommend the wines to accompany them.  Sister-in-law Raffaella and several members of the next generation also help in the dining room. There are five different menus to choose from;  a la carte, a multi-course Tasting Menu 55 euros/75 with wines, Old-Fashioned Meal 45euros/ 65 with wines, Only First Courses 35euros/55 with wines and on weekdays Business Lunch 19 euros.  I heartily recommend the home-made ravioli in a walnut and burnt garlic sauce, the candele (home-made short pasta) with codfish and baby green pepper sauce, and the roast suckling pig with spring onions and ginger.  The platter of local cheese and the homemade hazelnut ice cream are to die-for.  The wine list especially the choices from local cantine is impressive.

I have travelled the world and dined at many five star venues but this hidden treasure was a true gem. The combination of unusual flavours cleverly balanced eachother in every dish. All my senses were treated; the plates were beautifully preented, the smalls were enticing and the tastes were exquisite. Each plate in my degustation meal was accompanied by matching wines from the region, many of which are DOCG. Puccio Fischetti  is a warm host who has a story behind the origins and techniques behind eah plate. Compliment his food and his face lights up. I would recommend a visit to this restaurant for anyone visiting the Amalfi coast or Southern Italy.","1","","","","2010-12-08","2010-12-08","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r89380775-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"

And I have the honor of being a friend of the excellent Fischetti family.
For the last few years, I've devoted myself to eating at fancy names.
Obviously expensive.
Bottura, Gennarino Esposito, Spouse, Niko Romito and another in Marche 3 stars that I do not remember.
Putignano is considered the number 1 in Puglia.
Well I have to be honest.
I like OASIS much better.
Moreover very close and considering the location, the details, the impeccable professionalism and the sublime food and wine, it is very cheap.
The dishes must be tasted.
It would be pleonastic to describe them.
All apotheotic.
The millefeuille with cream and cherries was touching.
It was so beautiful and good that I even hated eating it.
Look I started eating a certain way 30 years ago from the legendary and unique Don Alfonso.
At the time 3 stars.
I've been around a lot but a family like Fischetti I've never found.
They are of a unique skill, professionalism and humility.
That's if I really have to make a combination The only family I would place at this level is the Iaccarino family.
I have decided that I will not go anywhere else but only to Oasis.
It would not make sense to go so far to eat so, for my taste, disappointing.

Atmosphere: 1","LOTS OF APPEARANCE, LITTLE SUBSTANCE.","While travelling, lunchtime, we are looking for a welcoming restaurant with home-made cuisine, near Monteverde (Av). The road signs take us to Vallesaccarda, in this elegant place, with cemetery lights, with poseades placed on the bare table, devoid of tablecloth. They bring us onion appetizers, and invisible tastes of I don't know what, unsolicited, which burdened our digestion, until the next day.
 But let's get to the menu, starters at least 25 euros per person, first courses with prices of 28 euros, second courses 38 euros, dessert 18 euros, with the imposition (which we dispute) of ordering at least three obligatory courses.
 On the plates, microscopic tasting portions of nouvelle cousine, not even of great quality and I'll stop here...
Welcoming and human warmth are fundamental in all contexts, because they give positivity to experiences.
 The environment is excessively formal, for those who want to enjoy authentic and genuine Italian cuisine. Here there is no trace of the warmth and friendliness, which are the pride of our hospitality.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-23","2024-03-23","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r943541788-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"

I ate really well and we were really happy. However, I just wanted to allow myself (if I can) and I say it very politely: the price is ok, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that you can't charge €25 for a plate of pasta with sauce for a little girl. I believe it is a code of ethics that all great restaurateurs should adhere to. I would also say it to Cannavacciuolo. Even the coffees (6€) having spent well over 100€ per person, could also be offered... In conclusion I thank the Oasis and the Fischetti brothers, I will remember the day and I will definitely return, but the way I think , you could have avoided charging the account. There was no need!..","4","","FAMILY","2024-02-29","2024-02-21","2024-02-21","en","Oasis Sapori Antichi","1196586","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2426300-d1196586-r939153782-Oasis_Sapori_Antichi-Vallesaccarda_Province_of_Avellino_Campania.html"
