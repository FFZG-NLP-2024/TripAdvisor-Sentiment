Amazing and interesting food.  Good atmosphere.  Staff friendly with just the right amount of interaction not to make it stuffy as it can be in some Michelin star restaurants.  
We had the Mediterranean Tasting menu without any add ins which was plenty and every course tasty.  
Would highly recommend","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/94/dc/40/caption.jpg

After a very friendly welcome, we were escorted to our table. Soon followed some snacks and our aperitif. We chose menu extreme and the surprise could begin. We were served the dishes quickly, in my opinion much too quickly. It all tasted very good except for the pork fat croissant. This one was really too big and not our favourite. Unfortunately, my table companion did not feel well, no, that was not due to the food, so we ended the evening early. So we were not able to enjoy the full menu and ended the evening with a feeling of guilt. Fortunately, all understanding came from the staff and they were kind enough not to charge for the full menu. Which we offcourse would have fully understood if they had. I certainly hope to be able to return one day to fully experience it. I do have a point of attention. The portions are correspondingly quite large for the extensive menu you normally get. I would create more balance in that and definitely lower the pace. That went really too fast.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/ea/79/4b/caption.jpg

Every aspect was perfection - from the minute we entered the restaurant to our very last morsel - the attention to detail is found everywhere. Each course presented another opportunity to outdo the one before and the journey through the culinary delights of Mallorcan food gave the menu a connection to local fare which was a highlight.

Food: 3","Unmet Cuisine Expectations and Poor Service","Prior to visiting Andreu Genestra, we were excited to try the tasting menu and the hyper-locally produced dishes. 

However, our expectations weren't met. The restaurant's head server was far from obliging, which is rare in a Michelin-rated restaurant. We've never experienced such arrogance or inability to be flexible whatsoever. We almost left before ordering, which we deeply regret not doing. 

Since we saw the sommelier greeting tables with such positivity, we ordered the wine pairing but were disappointed when our table didn't receive the same treatment and attention as others nearby. 

While the dishes on the tasting menu were stunningly presented, they lacked flavor and inspiration with some dishes relying on a heavy dose of salt as the main seasoning. During the service, we felt that the pacing between menu items was hurried and didn't give us time to enjoy the outside atmosphere. 

A friendlier staff would have slightly enhanced our experience, but in conclusion, we had higher expectations for a night that cost 500 EUR.","1","","NONE","2022-09-30","2022-09-15","2022-09-15","en","Andreu Genestra","3745964","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r860236024-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html"

It is a true culinary experience for your senses.
The menu combines flavours, textures, etc all using local ingredients and it is a tribute to the island of Mallorca.

We also did the wine pairing which was excellent. It combines some local Mallorcan wines and some other spanish wines, all of them simply amazing.

We took the signature menu and there were some courses which were excellent but some others were not to the level as you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. 

The waiters were very nice but they could not explain all dishes which is again a bit weird in such so-called top-notch restaurant. 

We gladly spent some money for a beautiful gastronomic dinner but here we were not so glad about spending 420 Euros (for two persons) at this restaurant. This was just a bit too much for the lacking quality in some of the dishes. We had hoped for a bit better.

Unfortunately it was not worth at all. 
Separately food was good  but not good enough what we paid… 
It was not synchronization between 
Basically everything was  pre-cooked in advance 
We been served too fast … 
We have a large experience with such a time of restaurants And as I said before it was not  following between. We took large menu with matching wine  well 9 plates 3 different vine only 😔
Everyone who reserved for gastronomic part of A.G.  We were sitting not very charming part of restaurant. What was surprising that others who where sitting at bistro part of restaurant that part was more charming and with live music . 
My point is if you are looking gastronomic experience it’s not there u find 
If you are looking to spend 230,00 euro per person    That’s the right place .
Hope my comment can help you.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1d/c1/f7/3b/caption.jpg

Naturally we were really rooting for their prized Michelin starred dining, but unfortunately it feel slightly short basis our experience of these calibre restaurants. Regrettably, I agree with other reviewers there are courses within the tasting menu that are hit and miss, and at times real flavour and spark is missing. Off the sensations menu the homemade olive oil and tapenade was just wonderful, but while the peanut course was bereft of any punch or flavour. The only true Michelin style standard came with the rice/foie based course which was rich and intense but poorly followed by a mushy Ray(didn’t feel fresh), and a very bland suckling pig - the cracking was flavourless. To be clear the staff were fantastic and knowledgable over the whole evening, and I really enjoyed the wine pairings - the tarragona fortified wine with the cheese was superb. I worry that maybe a bit of complacency is creeping in, and perhaps a bit of reinvention is needed to get it back to the gastronomic standard Andreu Genestre must wield. The surroundings are lush, and the local farm concept is superb. All the best for the future.

Some very interesting flavors and combinations. But mostly pushing the experimental aspect too far and missing out on a solid, delicious basis. There are no dishes from the sensations tasting menu we would love to have for a main another day. The modern interpretation of Crêpe Suzette at the end and the olive oil course in the beginning were probably the best.

Unfortunately there were some „mistakes“ for a star rated restaurant. We asked, for example, to slow down the pace after delivering first few courses literally plate after plate. They did that for one course and went immediately back to the super fast pace afterwards. Or we were alcohol free the whole night (not by choice!) and got juice pairing but got served a brandy as part of the dessert without even been asked or offered an alcohol free alternative. Lastly, the portion size was just too big (in particular the aubergine and rice dish) and we asked them to cut half the portions and to share the desserts. The former ended up in a not so nicely, literally pulled off some parts of the main component.

The location appears beautiful at first sight but is mediocre at the best. It’s lacking style and interior design. The garden lounge where you get drinks before dinner was not well maintained and felt improvised.","0","","COUPLES","2021-06-30","2021-07-01","2021-06-30","en","Andreu Genestra","3745964","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r794966578-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html"

It was experimental and new-thinking and pushed our boundaries, creating an unforgettable experience which is exactly what we expect from a Michelin star restaurant. The techniques were sophisticated and the ingredients just delicious. 
The surroundings were just gorgeous and the staff so attentive and kind, also to the children. They even accomodated that our daughter is a pescetarian with no problem at all.

I will not go into more detail as I think it should just be an experience to be had without knowing too much in advance. 
Just go for it!","0","","NONE","2020-08-31","2020-08-10","2020-08-10","en","Andreu Genestra","3745964","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r764111714-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html"

We enjoyed many of the courses and in particular the earlier ones of oil, fruit soup (pictured), veggie terrine and falafel, but the later courses were not for us (tuna, prawn, puddings). The cheese plate was gorgeous though. Also we didn’t expect so much food and length of time (again probably our inexperience). It was 4 hours and portions were larger than you would expect (in my view) for 9 courses PLUS amous Bouche and petit fours. Love just too much and too long for us.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/aa/00/ec/andreu-genestra.jpg","COUPLES","2020-07-31","2020-07-31","2020-07-31","en","Andreu Genestra","3745964","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r762409010-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html"

The restaurant is made up of inner and outside dining areas. We have dined in both and had equally nice experiences. The layout is quite simple, but pleasant. I actually prefer the outside restaurant as it overlooks the beautiful gardens with their spacious lounging areas. The view at sunset is simply spectacular. 
Apart from the exquisite meals one is bound to experiences here, Andreu Genestra’s choice of various types of exotic tableware are also a sight to behold - very unique and unusual! His sense of innovative style was also displayed in the presentation of the cheeses which are served on broken earthenware which put together form the shape of the island of Mallorca. 👍🏾The meals are very tasty, artistically presented and truly representative of the different regional flavours. The maestro chef himself also always makes the point to come out to greet guests, as well as personally serving out  dishes while giving background information about these. It’s always a pleasure to eat here and enjoy the culinary experience! 👍🏾","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/9d/fa/63/photo0jpg.jpg

Late afternoon we made a reservation via their website, leaving the credit card details for a reservation for that evening and awaited confirmation. It did not arrive and not being able to get anyone by phone to check they were expecting us and given the restaurant was a 40 min drive away, we made other arrangements. Then one hour after the time of the requested reservation a Genestra colleague called asking where were we. We explained the situation and how disappointed we were. Bearing in mind this all took place in a 5 hour window, the Andreu Genestra  maître d′ decided to charge £60 per person cancellation fee and took the payment from the credit card. A rather mean act by an individual who has no care for the value of tourists or the reputation of the restaurant. I have no doubt the food is as stated, but recommend than NO ONE leaves their credit card details on there for fear it could be abused.","0","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-09-11","2019-09-11","en","Andreu Genestra","3745964","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r708842518-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html"
