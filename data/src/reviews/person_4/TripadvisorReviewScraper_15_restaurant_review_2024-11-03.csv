There was not room in the house that is close to the restaurant so we stayed in a small kind of abandoned hotel where we were the only ones but it was fine. Also very nice that there was a free selection of snacks and drinks. the hotel was in a very small village called Torup and it is just next to a lake. Next morning they turned on the sauna so we could go there and I took a swim in the lake but be aware that the ladder down to the lake is too short so it’s difficult to get back up again! the restaurant the food and the whole set up was perfect and very nice staff - also the owner and his wife are very nice. The breakfast was also very good and the surroundings are really amazing. 
When you come to the hotel, they will give you a list of places that are nice to make a walk in. And there are lots of beautiful places around.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-22","2024-05-22","en","Knystaforsen","23236290","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15297031-d23236290-r951879008-Knystaforsen-Torup_Halland_County_West_Coast.html"

At the set time of dinner we walked the short distance to the restaurant and were warmly greeted outside by the owner and chef - what a nice welcome. The menu for the dinner was set, so we only had to choose wine. However, here was the only less positive point of the experience, as the prices on the wine card were unreasonable high (cost to qualify), So we opted for the wine pairing, which I usually don’t do - this was actually quite fine. The food came in a good pace in many small servings - all presented in beautiful pottery and even more importantly with great taste. Some of the dished was served outside by the fire. During the evening we were taken exceptionally well care of by the team - they are just so attentive and enthusiastic. All in all an unforgettable, and one of the best dining experiences, I have had for a long time, which was echoed by my partner and the other participants. It is a “must visit“ dining experience.","0","","FRIENDS","2023-10-31","2023-11-20","2023-11-19","en","Knystaforsen","23236290","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15297031-d23236290-r926616973-Knystaforsen-Torup_Halland_County_West_Coast.html"

The motto of Knystaforsen really rings true, a great evening with superb and creative cooking, friendly staff, and pleasant ambiance. Many small servings based on local produce, strong on umami whether veggie, fish or meat that to excellent sauces. Cooking takes place over open fires outside also in winter, and sitting outdoors briefly around the fire for a quick æbleskive with gooseberry filling was brilliant, if a bit nippy. A great evening out, certainly worth more than one visit!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/f6/cc/d3/caption.jpg

","Last fridag I had the distinct pleasure of dining in the spectacular restaurant Knystaforsen. 
The place is absolutely magical, the people fantastic and the food.... Oh boy the food... AMAZING and almost impossible to describe. Like trying to describe a midsummer sundown to a blind man. 
15 courses of utter sensory perfection created by the wizard chef Nicolai Tram. No shortcuts, No limits, 100% local. 1000% delicious and astonishing looking dishes. 
From the moose tartar with pike roe - to cured pikeperch jaws smoked on juniper berry branches... I was left with goosebumps several times and my jaw dropped to many times i looked like a fish out of water. 
Paired with wonderful wines and non alcoholic curiosity’s by sommelier Eva Helbæk Tram. Mind blowing and inspiring. Fireweed flower made into a sparkling dream!! 

Guys this has to go on your bucket list!!

A huge thanks to wizard chef Nicolai Tram & super-sommelier Eva Helbæk Tram for a fireworks night never to forget. 

P.s. If you find a hobbo outside your kitchendoor begging for scraps. Do not be alarmed. It’s just me going through what can only be described as “divine food withdrawal”.

We also booked overnight and breakfast which in itself was an experience! What a breakfast! Knystaforsen is well worth a visit if you like to eat a tasting menu with fantastically exciting food! 20 small dishes with a suitable drink! I have once again eaten things I probably never would have tried otherwise! This was our second visit and Knystaforsen has managed to become even more amazing!

There is no doubt that all the dishes are well prepared and the place has a message 
The food was good but we felt that the whole stay was too expensive
In addition to paying for one night then you have to pay 500 kr per person for breakfast, we were installed on a small guesthouse but it was definitely not worth the money and it required a transport to and from the restaurant 
The dishes were good but very small unfortunately
A stay for 4 people with dinner and breakfast and a little wine yes it was 29.000 kr and definitely not worth it unfortunately","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/e3/2a/7a/caption.jpg
