I will not dwell on the experience made by Andreas Caminada (and his partner and chef de cuisine Marcel Skibba), it would take up too much space.
The place is lovely, I dare say magical, as well as the castle and the staff all help you live this dream.
Special mention to sommelier Luca Marzullo (Swiss Ticino, not Italian): never seen so much competence and commitment in recommending a wine that could meet our tastes.
Recommendation to live the experience at 360 degrees, then to stay in one of the beautiful rooms of the castle, not to miss the sumptuous morning breakfast.
The price of all this? For those who can afford the last thing to watch, but certainly proportionate to what is offered and absolutely in line with the multi-starred national.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/a3/7a/6d/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Culinary delights","Schauenstein Castle is one of ""The World's 50 Best Restaurants"". Absolutely deserved. This little world of indulgence is one of those Fine Dining Fan-Clou that should be treated regularly. The castle master Andreas Caminada has been delighting with his top cuisine for years. Every course, every Amuse Bouche and the delicate Surprise courses of the Unpacked menu lasting several hours tasted excellent. Here the guest can expect everything; simplicity in the choice of products, up to maximum detail on the plate. Of particular note is the love for the region, which is processed here in various courses. As a guest, you can feel the attention of the processed products, so that a maximum of taste comes to the fork. The wine accompaniment, suitable for each course, from near and far, offers a full pack of pleasure. Evil tongues claim that wine is overtaxing the palate and impairs one's sensory ability. I don't want to share this thesis here. Probably because the wine accompaniment lasts through the evening and complements the great food. The sense of aesthetics runs through the dining room, creating a relaxed atmosphere. Eating at Schauenstein Castle is not an experiment, but a safe value. In this sense; thank you very much for the hospitality and see you next time.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7f/9c/e4/caption.jpg

The customer is truly listened to, considered and made comfortable. You are also served 7 different salty sweets. What a mouthwash!
Then we take you inside to your table. There are two rooms and about 6 tables per room. Then comes 4 appetizers. And then the dishes. We opted for a surprise dish at first (a real treat the lobster!) but considering the number of dishes we had to resign ourselves not to take the second surprise dish as penultimate dish.
Everything was a treat for the eyes and for the taste buds! Congratulations to the chef and his helpers! Congratulations for the service! In short, BRAVO, for everything!
We took a wine formula for each dish and an alcohol-free formula for each dish. The choice of wines is international and interesting, but we still drink quite a lot in the end. Non-alcohol is very interesting and tests flavours that would not be thought of.
For coffee/tea (extra charge), we were invited to the terrace and we were able to enjoy 6 different sweeties again. 
A superb experience to offer for a great occasion ....","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/79/02/ab/caption.jpg

There is a lobby upstairs you can have coffee and petit fours.

The constantly changing staff, some of whom are under-trained, is one of them. The food is still prepared with great care, but the variety that we used to appreciate so much is missing this time. We have nothing against healthy food, but the fact that 80% of the dishes served are vegetarian, or mainly pickled, sour vegetables, is incomprehensible to us. And the fact that the price has gone up so much is even more disappointing.

Perfect and perfect choice! Beyond the cuisine which has no comparison with other starred restaurants, the wonderful location and the very kind staff, the chef has a way of doing things and total availability that make you feel at home.
I asked if I could visit the castle and the chef himself acted as our guide, chatting and showing us around his house as if we were old friends. Not only is he disarmingly pleasant both for the eyes and for his way of being, but also a chef who knows how to transform freshly harvested raw materials from his fantastic vegetable garden into dishes with top marks each.
The complete dinner we had began with an aperitif in the room on the second floor, with 6 wonderful tastings which already give an idea of his capabilities.
We then moved to the restaurant where our journey included a dozen EXCEPTIONAL courses, accompanied by warm bread and two types of mountain butter. Then pre-dessert and another 6 or 7 small sweet treats and the actual dessert. Finally we return to the upper room for coffee and digestives and continue with the small pastry shop and a delicious mini chocolate mousse for my birthday dessert.
I haven't memorized all the names of the dishes, but the crispy lobster in the bisque, the roe deer, the whitefish and the pumpkin in three consistencies are definitely still in my taste buds. What to say? I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present. We stayed overnight in the Casa Caminada annex and it was all a beautiful dream. When you do something for yourself it's wonderful. Worth returning in the summer to appreciate the outdoor gazebos. Chapeau","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/c3/c1/c7/caption.jpg

The culinary journey through 5 regionally influenced courses, accompanied by many little surprises, left nothing to be desired.

Much of the vegetables, prepared with creative sophistication and the utmost perfection, grow in the castle's own garden and are simply astonishing in terms of taste and presentation. The fish variations were so tender that a knife was neither necessary nor served. The wine accompaniment to the individual courses was perfectly chosen and explained in a friendly manner with a lot of interesting specialist knowledge. There were again some wines among them that opened your eyes to how diverse the world of wine is.

A subsequent overnight stay in the historic walls of Schauenstein Castle is also well worth it to round off the experience. The rooms (here Suite Erde) are venerable, large rooms and the successful combination of design and antiquity is impressive.

The next morning, a clear breakfast buffet awaits you, mostly with regional products of high quality. Bread, cold cuts and Bircher muesli were wonderful. The egg preparations are again in gourmet style and can be ordered individually on request. Wonderful.

The entire farm complex around the castle, which looks like a small village, is just as interesting. Many discoveries, such as the in-house bakery, coffee roastery, wine storage and the impressive storage cellar reflect the cuisine and the regional origin of the ingredients.

The staff, who accompanied you throughout your stay in an extremely friendly and attentive manner, were also absolutely convincing. The guest feels like they are in the royal yet down-to-earth center, and this in a very friendly, relaxed and not aloof way.

Highest score for food, accommodation and experience. All awards absolutely deserved. We would love to come back to Fürstenau!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/57/c2/7b/caption.jpg

Our Suite was wonderful... like entering a fairytale world where you can distance yourself from the outside world. The afternoon was spent in the small village with a visit to the various places that are part of the structure and then dinner. I would say an extraordinary experience where Chef Andreas, who we had the pleasure of meeting, expresses his art in every dish. The journey began with an aperitif and then took us to the beautiful dining room: each dish was an emotion of flavors and colours... works of art that first satisfy the eyes and the mind and then you savor the taste... and 'It was a crescendo of quality and creativity'.
Signature dishes that transform a simple vegetable into an unforgettable dish.
The desserts are unforgettable, they are also works of art.
Breakfast was equally rich and even a simple egg was transformed into a dish to remember.
We left the Castle with the certainty that we will return as the emotions and indelible memories make us relive our stay with great happiness.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/f6/a3/7f/caption.jpg

Pensiamo a cosa significhi fare qualcosa per noi stessi …. Pensiamo a sorrisi, carezze e serenità …. Ecco parlare di Schloss Schauenstein significa tutto questo. L’esperienza nel castello svizzero a Fürstenau é stata davvero strabiliante…. una delle migliori della nostra vita sia dal punto di vista gastronomico che emozionale. Innanzitutto il viaggio per arrivarci… meraviglioso il passaggio estivo dal passo dello Spluga e poi il soggiorno in una splendida camera (la Canova) …. ma soprattutto la cena in uno dei tempi della ristorazione mondiale…. tre stelle michelin, 19 cappelli Gault Millot, eletto recentemente 26° miglior ristorante al mondo da 50 best…. insomma davvero una super eccellenza! La curiosità di confrontarci con la cucina di chef Caminada e Skibba era tantissima e siamo stati ripagati con un torrente di emozioni, di brividi, di classe, di bellezza, di gusto che ci hanno sinceramente travolti e in più di un’occasione lasciati senza parole….. Iniziamo col dire che il locale é meraviglioso, immerso nel verde e nel silenzio… un’oasi di pace….. varcata la soglia d’ingresso pare ritrovarsi al centro di un mondo antico…. luci soffuse, colori scuri… sala dal sapore classico….. ma niente é come sembra…. il servizio é giovane, frizzante, leggero ma capace di illustrare (anche in italiano) le mille sfumature dei piatti di chef Caminada e la cucina sarà proprio l’emblema di questa moderna freschezza inserita in un contesto classico che più classico non si può . Davvero affascinante il modo in cui spiccano la ricerca, la freschezza , la non staticità dei piatti che ci sono arrivati. Sono il trionfo del buon senso, dell’amore per ciò che ci circonda, dell’abbandono dell’opulenza e dell’abbraccio amorevole del reale. Caminada valorizza ciò che gli appartiene, ciò che ha a portata di mano…. ma lo fa in un modo talmente soave da portarci in un altrove che é carezza, coccolo, serenità e sorriso come dicevamo all’inizio. Sbalorditivo. Sarebbe impossibile per complessità raccontare tutti i 12 piatti che ci sono stati proposti… possiamo solo elencarvi alcuni passaggi. Il percorso parte con una serie di appetizers offerti dalla cucina in cui spicca un Taco al pastrami da applausi… si prosegue con alcuni snacks (4 per la precisione) uno più bello dell’altro… trionfo di colori, sapori (incredibile l’utilizzo delle note acide), incrocio di fiori, vegetale, pesce e carne …. padronanza di tecniche e conoscenza di culture….. (stratosferici il coregone, i piselli bbq e il gyoza all’anatra!!!!!). Ci arriva il pane (meravigliosamente autoprodotto) con un burro allo yogurt che ci ricorderemo per molto tempo…. si passa poi ai piatti ufficiali del menù partendo con un Luccio perca con peperoni e una mousse al cetriolo che definire capolavoro é riduttivo….. si prosegue con l’animella più buona che abbiamo mai assaggiato (panure, fungo shitake, cipolla bbq e un fondo che rimanda all’oriente)…. poi un salmerino magistrale su foglia di lattuga e a chiudere la parte salata un agnello che é poesia. Il dessert arriva a mettere la parola fine su questo strabiliante percorso con un senso di circolarità…. facendoci ritrovare l’albicocca (simbolo della stagionalità ) in differenti declinazioni. Tre piccoli gioiellini : giochi di mousse, fermentazioni, granite, caldo/freddo, consistenze…. sferificazioni, cialde, mousse, sorbetti e poi un donuts inaspettato e confortante. 2 chiacchiere piacevoli con lo chef che conferma la sua semplicità amorevole e poi  Piccola pasticceria con tisana e caffè in un altra sala e la voglia di dire no….. non può essere finita!!!!!! Quello che abbiamo vissuto a Schloss Schauenstein é semplicemente questo: un atto di puro amore…. il raggiungimento della PERFEZIONE ma senza presunzione….  la SOSTENIBILE leggerezza dell’essere. Standing ovation.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/a5/31/57/caption.jpg

Mein Geschäftspartner und ich waren vergangene Woche im Schloss essen und haben dort übernachtet. Ich selbst musste wegen meiner Tochter mitten in der Nacht abreisen.

Am nächsten Tag werde ich vom Hotel kontaktiert und es wird mir mitgeteilt, dass ein Kissen und ein Fön entwendet wurden. Nach einigen Tagen ist das Kissen wohl wieder aufgetaucht, der Fön bleibt verschwunden.

Ob der Fön von Mitarbeitern oder von anderen Hotelgästen entwendet wurden, weiss ich nicht. Jedoch ist es ziemlich beängstigend, dass in einem Hotel dieser Kategorie aus den Zimmern geklaut wird und dann zu allem Überfluss den Hotelgästen in Rechnung gestellt wird.

Ein weiteres besonderes Augenmerk gilt dem Pool des Hotels. Der Pool ist wirklich der mit Abstand schlechteste Hotelpool, den ich je gesehen habe. Auf jedem 1 Sterne Camping Platz gibt es einen besseren Pool.

Zuletzt sind die Zimmer im Sommer unerträglich heiss. Ich war fast erleichtert in der Nacht noch abreisen zu dürfen.

Das Essen ist allerdings ein Traum. Schade dass die Küche unter der schlechten Hotelführung und der mangelnden Sicherheit im Hotel leiden muss","3","","BUSINESS","2023-06-30","2023-06-22","2023-06-22","de","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r896846499-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 5","Das Paket stimmt","Die Erwartungen wurden alle erfüllt. Hervorheben möchte ich die ""familiäre Atmosphäre"" und der Raumwechsel zwischen Apéro, Dinner und Dessert. Das Menü war lokal und spannend, freundlicher - aufmerksamer Service. Herr Caminada und Herr Skibba kamen persönlich an jeden Tisch zur Begrüssung.

So und jetzt noch was zu den negativen Bewertungen: Natürlich darf auf dieser Platform jeder seinen Senf dazugeben und Kritik soll und darf erlaubt sein, vorallem in der Preisklasse vom Schauenstein.
Aber wer dauernd und überall das Haar in der Suppe findet, der hat nie gelernt was geniessen heisst. Das macht man nicht mit dem Kopf. Sterne Küche heisst ja nicht man isst das Beste, was man je gehabt hat - es gibt Leute, die ziehen einen Wurst/Käse Salat der Gourmetküche vor und bei 10-15 Gängen inkl. Amuse Bouche hat es immer Gänge dabei, die schmecken einem nicht oder sind Mittelklasse aber dafür gibts auch wieder 2-3 Top Gänge, so ist das halt - sind auch nur Menschen.

Ausserdem: Wer hier noch reklamiert es sei alles zu sauer, der soll sich halt vorher erkundigen. Ich habe in der Küche gefragt warum Gäste sagen könnten, es sei zu sauer. Das Konzept sei halt so, dass man auf der etwas säuerlichen Seite beginng umd den Gaumen anzuregen und dann eher cremig abschliesst. Und sauer heisst ja nicht, sauer weil falsch gewürzt sondern sie ernten das Gemüse vom Schlossgarten im Sommer und fermentieren es um im Winter auch das eigene Gemüse anzubieten statt aus Uebersee. Das wollte ich mal noch sagen.

Wie schon erwähnt, ist alles Geschmacksache aber für mich stimmt das Gesamtpaket.","2","","NONE","2023-02-28","2023-02-27","2023-02-26","de","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r880289642-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

All fine...it is a very old building. They serve mainly local and seasonal food, which I very much appriciate. I selected a five course dinner, which started with four different starters, of which all of them were on the very sour side. The individual taste of each ingredients was noticeable on the tongue and palate for a very short time, if at all ...the only thing which lasted was the sour taste....till the next course....same again.. The main courses were ok, but far away from what I would call 3 michelin star quality. On all tables, next to me, people were eating a lot of bread offered aside.... if I write a lot ... real a lot.

Incredible amuse-bouches served during the aperitif, each one more fun and enjoyable than the next which set us up for the dinner with great expectations. Then the dinner, great great food and so pretty too. However, wine waiter or sommelier, as was not clear, got the wine wrong twice. Service good but totally mechanical. When the chef came to the table at the end it reflected the service, seemed a chore rather than a pleasure, better not to come at that point. Overall felt more of a factory line which took away from the amazing food. Stayed overnight too and rooms very nice indeed but charging CHF 4 for a small bottle of hand sanitizer seemed bizarre for a CHF 600 / night  room.","0","","NONE","2022-04-30","2022-11-15","2022-11-15","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r868539901-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"
