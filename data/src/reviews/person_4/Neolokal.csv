In the meantime, NeoLokal got awarded a Michelin star and a Green Michelin star. Unfortunately, my recent visit was unfortunately a pretty bad experience. It has become a pretty pretentious restaurant (watching a small film on an iPad before a dish ??!!), with non describable bland food and pretentious, haughty service. We had chosen one of the 2  wine flights proposed to accompany our meal (fixed menu), and the sommelier had described all the wines on the flight. However, the last 2 wines served were different than the ones described and were rest of bottles (presumably from another wine flight) - we literally  received tasting portions for the last 2 wines as there wasn't much left in the bottles. I presume the sommelier didn't want to open new bottles for us, as we were the last table in the mostly empty restaurant. Food was uniformly bland, with the best dish being the one presented by the iPad video (based on morel mushrooms, which, ironically for a green star michelin, are not in season). 
To cap this off, the bill came to 250 euros per head. I don't remember the last time I've had such bad value for money. 
I can't say whether the restaurant received the star based on the experience I've had, or was ruined after the Michelin star by changing its cuisine and jacking up the prices. Regardless, this was pretty bad on all fronts. 
There's much better food to be had in Istanbul at more reasonable prices. I'm steering well clear in future.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-10-03","2024-10-03","en","Neolokal","7178552","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r972368794-Neolokal-Istanbul.html"

So What do I expect at this price range? Exemplary, knowledgeable friendly service and a memorable meal great across the board with at least a couple of truely outstanding dishes.

So I made a reservation for 9 pm had been in contact with the restaurant throughout the week. I arrived at 2015 approx intention to have a couple or more cocktails seated at the bar said to host brought me outside past the bar to the seated area at this stage if I wasn’t going to be able to sit at the bar I would rather be inside with a view so I asked to be put inside by a window . I managed one cocktail Aztec dream quite nice but were pushing to get started I think they asked me for my menu chiloices this is where I knew there would be issues because I had already been emailed in advance and asked for my menu choices in my case the standard tasting menu and the premium wine pairing system allegedly because the restaurant espouses a sustainable ethos and only does enough to match customers on the night fair enough great idea in practice but obviously wasn’t true or a sloppy night since I had already picked but I  finished my cocktail looking for another but they had already started with the food again well before 2100 so I just went with the wine, asked for the wi fi access again took ages.

Of the food the mushroom morel was great, the lamb three styles was at least interesting and the bonito was the one dish that matched my expectations fabulous across the board everything else completely forgettable.

The premium wine list was at least interesting a collection of premium Turkish wines I am not familiar with Turkish wines and it was a pleasure to become acquainted but even there when I ventured a couple of questions at the sommelier he looked at me blankly and walked away which to be fair may have been just a language barrier.however the fact that no one from beginning to end including when I was paying asked me how I got on is, at this level, unforgivable maybe the fact I was a solo diner was a factor? Look not the worst meal I ever had , not by a long shot, but at this level Michelin it was the only one where I have been slightly frustrated and very bored throughout make of that what you will.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/a2/49/f7/caption.jpg

Neolokal tasting menu is a ""gourmet' take on Turkish cuisine that sometime seemed to be trying too hard.  We were particularly amused by the pretentious video they made of their morel mushroom course as were several other guests.  Not necessary as the entree spoke for itself.   Several of the courses arrived lukewarm and we felt for the staff which had to truck every course up a significant flight of stairs (kitchen on different level than guests).

Atmosphere: 3","Photo Worthy","Once upon a time, a quirky artist decided to swap his canvas for a plate and took his talents to Neolokal, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Istanbul. The artist’s mission? To create a feast for the eyes, if not for the taste buds.

As we entered Neolokal, we were greeted by a gallery of glassware and ceramics that could make a museum curator green with envy. Each plate was a canvas, and each dish a masterpiece—but only in appearance. It’s as if Neolokal hired Michelangelo to plate their food, but left the cooking to someone who thinks salt and pepper are exotic spices.

The meal began with an array of appetizers that looked like they were designed by a team of architects. Each bite was visually stunning, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, like a modern art piece you almost feel guilty for eating. However, one nibble in and you realize that the excitement ends at the eyes. The flavors were fresh and authentic, yes, but boring.

Then there was the foam. Oh, the foam! So many dishes came with its own fluffy cloud, a frothy crown atop each plate. It felt like Neolokal had an obsession with foam, perhaps believing it could carry the flavor burden. Instead, it felt like we were dining in a culinary car wash, where every taste got lost in a sea of bubbles. The foam was everywhere—salads, mains, even the desserts &  cocktails. I half-expected my coffee to come with a side of foam, and a barista in a scuba suit.

The following courses continued the trend—each one a Picasso on a plate, visually breathtaking but with flavors that were more 50 shades of beige. The dishes didn’t push any flavor boundaries; they played it safe, opting for elegance over excitement. Neolokal’s approach seemed to be ‘dress to impress,’ but they forgot that our tongues don’t care about haute couture—they want a flavor explosion, not a fashion show.

As we sipped our wine from glasses that looked like they were sculpted by Rodin himself, we couldn’t help but feel a little underwhelmed. Neolokal delivered a sensory feast for the eyes, but left our taste buds yearning for something more daring, something that would challenge and excite. It was a meal that satisfied the Instagram feed, but left the palate looking for more.

In the end, Neolokal is a place where the plate is the star, and the food is its understudy. It’s a restaurant that knows how to wow visually, but needs to remember that eating is not just about looking—it’s about tasting, and that’s where they missed the mark. If you’re after a meal that’s as beautiful as a museum exhibit but tastes like a chef’s day off, then Neolokal is your destination. Just don’t expect your taste buds to send a post card. 

Oh and whilst money isn't everything, they charged €450  for three glasses of cognac. An entire bottle is €350... #justsayin","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/81/0a/f5/caption.jpg

Overall, it was great food - the presentation and flavors are everything you would expect from a Michelin restaurant. That also includes the service. The food was tasty and so were the drinks. 

I'd say the only critique I have is I wish our server took more time explaining the ingredients of the dishes - often time he would mention what the dish's name was and serve. Also, there is one part of the tasting menu where they give you a tablet to watch a video on how the dish they are about to serve is made. This part of the tasting menu felt a little gimmicky. Also, the price of this dinner is on par with Michelin restaurants in the US - be prepared to pay $200+ for 2 people.

It's a restaurant worth going to and the food, service, and overall quality shows why it has a Michelin star.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-20","2024-03-20","en","Neolokal","7178552","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r943217513-Neolokal-Istanbul.html"

There are only three dishes on the tasting menu, but they serve them quickly and I think every dish will suit Japanese tastes.
The presentation is unique and interesting, and the wine seems relatively reasonable.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/25/98/b3/caption.jpg
