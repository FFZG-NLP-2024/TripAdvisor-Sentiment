Atmosphere: 4","High-level Talent with Questionable  Restaurant Practices","The Chef is among the most sophisticated in the city--innovative,  imaginative, and a master with vegetables.  Most of what we ate was delicious and expanded our taste experience.  The opening oyster with raspberry and shallot cream and the pumpkin seed ""focaccia"", with bay leaf and a wonderful combination of butter and olive oil, were both inspired.  An asparagus spear with almond foam and a touch of rhubarb played off rich and tart flavors in a subtle way.  The chef's signature smoked herring in black sesame sauce covering diced apple was a wonder.  We found the abalone with seaweed puree and seaweed butter, enhanced by minty herb, only slightly less perfect.  The final main, a medium rare duck in an orange and onion flavored sauce, with asparagus, tasted good.  But in relation to the rest of the meal, it  was a jolt.  Instead of imaginative and innovative, it seemed just a good version of something familiar.  Moreover, the duck was chewy.  This was a real come-down from the string of preceding, near perfect, innovative dishes.  Dessert was also mixed.  The strawberries marinated and glazed with strawberry and elderberry juice with almond sorbet were marvelous; but the  traditional strawberry tart was bland and uninteresting, another miscalculation.  Finishing bites were very good and innovative, except that the crepe with pecan cream seemed a bit heavy for a finish.  So mostly, a terrific meal with some surprising lapses.  It was fun to have a window on the chefs working in the kitchen.  Decor is tasteful and attractive.  Noise level too high, though not oppressive.  Our main criticism was of the service.  Although friendly, it was not graceful.  One waiter dropped food on the table behind us.  We had to wait puzzlingly long for our coats. After declaring that we did not want any of the offered extras, beyond the tasting menu, a waiter intentionally left an open caviar tin on the table.  So we had to reject it again. More worrisome: in an apple sorbet, palate-cleanser after the main course, we were offered an alcoholic calvados or non-alcoholic calvados syrup.  There was no indication that the alcoholic choice cost extra (it cost 48E for two, we learned  later).  The couple at the table next to us complained about the charge at length, when they were presented with the bill; so we know that we were not alone in being misled.  I made the point, but did not belabor it, and paid up.  In many fine-dining experiences in Paris (1-, 2-, and 3- michelin star restaurants) over many years, this sort of thing has never happened.  A chef of Toutain's talent should not be associated with such  practices.  All of this left a bad aftertaste in what should have been a fine meal.  Most of the food was at a very very high level, but meals should be more than showcases of talent.  They should be an occasion for fellow-feeling, not for feeling that one has been misled for extra Euros.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-12","2024-06-12","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r954846101-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

It's long been my favorite Paris restaurant.  It earned a second Michelin star since we ere last there, so what could it do but be even better?  What a disappointment.  The tasting menu was fairly pedestrian, and the presentation was lackluster and unenthusiastic.  The white burgundy was not kept cool, so that two hours into the long meal, it was actually WARM - not ""room temperature."" Why?  There's just no excuse for indifferent service.  The waiter stopped pouring the wine at one point, for reasons known only to him. My companion chastised me for not asking for more wine.  I don't expect to have to ask that a waiter notice an empty wine glass.  The room, which used to be warm  - even whimsical - is now cold and staid.","0","","FAMILY","2024-04-30","2024-05-13","2024-05-13","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r950724370-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

For two Michelin star restaurant, the service was terrible. 

We were constantly thirsty because our glasses were not refilled and we wanted to order more wine bottles but our waiter never came around. The service is painfully slow and the food came out at a random SLOW pace. It took total of four hours to finish the course and at the end we were so irritated because we were mostly bored and trying to get the waiter to refill our drinks. 

The waiter didn’t speak good English so when he explained the dish, none of us understood what he was saying. 

Such a huge disappointment and wish that we went to a different restaurant","0","","FRIENDS","2024-01-31","2024-05-09","2024-05-09","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r950206464-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

In the past every aspect of Toutain's  restaurant was a delight: the uniqueness of each course, the whimsey  of the plates on which it was served, the  variety and uniqueness of each bite, the joy of the wait staff......

No restaurant, ""on any planet"",  had that charm.

The restaurant now has two stars instead of one. We are served by serious men in suits, who present as if they are tired  of what they are describing, one course is too much like the other. Subtle variety is a gift  but this was not it.

The negative I am trying to convey is this could be any fine restaurant, in any country or city. The price no different from many  fine restaurants,  but as the Little Price would put it, it has ceased to be ""unique in all the world"".","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-05-04","2024-05-04","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r949489922-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 5","The best meal I've ever had.","WOW!  What an exceptional experience.  Absolutely worth every penny.  We had such a wonderful meal, each and every item was delicious.  Both my husband and I commented frequently that we could eat a whole lot more of that or settle for licking our plates.  Most items were an evolution from entering the mouth to the finish.  Such complex flavors.  We had dinner with the wine pairing, which included cider and saki, as well as untold wines, and it was fabulous.  We will cherish this experience the rest of our lives.  The atmosphere and staff are exceptional.

Atmosphere: 2","Extraordinary cuisine but what noise!","We chose the Meadowsweet menu; everything was beautiful, succulent, surprising and of high quality. The service was a little below what I see in starred restaurants but what partly ruined our evening was the atmosphere of the station hall in the dining room. Is it the lack of embarrassment of the one-night guests or the relaxed atmosphere of the establishment that encourages this type of behavior? For these reasons I will probably recommend it to my friends with moderate enthusiasm.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2023-12-02","2023-12-02","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r928172230-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 3","Quite a deal for that…","Some signature dishes like hare and eel but sometimes we are drowned in the multiple flavors without general unity of the cuisine or the menu. The extra lobster adds nothing (apart from the cost) to the meal which is already stretching. The salmon is confusingly ordinary and we would have liked to find a slightly more original fish for such an expensive 2-star with slow and laborious service.","0","","FAMILY","2023-11-30","2023-11-17","2023-11-17","en","Restaurant David Toutain","6115029","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d6115029-r926276915-Restaurant_David_Toutain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
