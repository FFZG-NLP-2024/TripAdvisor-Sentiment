We have to say Domestic was our FAVORITE restaurant of the whole trip. The food, the staff, the decor... everything was perfect. The food, though.... absolutely incredible use of local and innovative ingredients. We just wish we could have gone back a second time.","1","","FAMILY","2024-06-30","2024-08-16","2024-08-16","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r965125815-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"

The atmosphere was exceptionally pleasant, immediately setting a cozy mood. The team was incredibly friendly and attentive, which made the evening even more enjoyable. A special highlight was the excellent wine pairing. The selection of Danish wines was impressive and paired perfectly with the dishes served. We were particularly thrilled by the quality and diversity of the Danish wines introduced to us. The restaurant's concept of focusing on local and sustainable products was reflected not only in the food but also in the overall philosophy of the establishment. This approach is not only commendable but also contributed to the uniqueness of our culinary experience. In short, a visit to Restaurant Domestic is in a class of its own and leaves nothing to be desired.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/19/b5/ca/caption.jpg

Sustainable Michelin star eating","So my boyfriend took me out to this restaurant as a surprise birthday present, and we had the absolute best time! Everything from the service to the food, was Michelin star quality. My favourite meal I had was the dumplings with the puffed up flatbread and smoked cheese inside - so if you get that you’re lucky!! Also I recommend trying the rhubarb gin it’s super delicious! 

What I love about the place particularly is its ethos - everything is bought locally and all comes from Denmark and they do seasonal eating / depending on what they can find determines what food they cook. It’s great and very sustainable! 

Ok finally, a shout out to our waitresses who looked after us, and especially to Inês who really made our night with her extensive knowledge of wine and general happy and friendly demeanour. Thank you to all Domestic staff and chefs!! :)","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/a3/89/c9/caption.jpg

However this time they did not match my expectations. The menu and the wine menu didn't bring the best out in each other and the taste sensation we were left with was sour and the odour putrid. The end result was indigestion.

The staff was as always alert and competent and the  servings was  beautifully presented - that is the only reason it is not a 1 star review. 

I had the sensation that the owner is making a lot of experiments which is great, however he have forgotten the saying ""kill your darlings"" - it might be a fun and unique experiment but that doesn't mean it is good. An example was the homemade sparkling apple based ""wine"".  If Domestic  is unable to match existing products in the market (f.ex. Andersen on Djursland) or the product doesn't meet Domestic standards then don't allow it on the menu.","0","","COUPLES","2021-12-31","2021-12-19","2021-12-19","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r822438403-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"

The kitchen is still very dogmatic and experimental but I found it to less ""over-the-edge"" this time than on previous visits; like they are more rooted in their concept. The menu was still very exiting but each dish came with a depth that I hadn't experienced before. They certainly did seem to have a beedrock of confidence in the way the food was presented. 

Still visually beautiful creations. The snack w. duck heart, lobster tail and grilled purple cale was out of this world. The best dish was the celariac w. mussels. Halibut w. flowers and sauce was visually stunning and flavourful and the duck was cooked to perfection. 

Wine list is rather extensive and I found the ratio between natural and more conventional wines to be more balanced than previously. And reasonably priced in terms of Danish prices. 

Services as always very attentive and down-to-earth polite. 

Will definitely be back.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/21/8c/88/58/snacks-note-the-duck.jpg

Food: 5","Very long, but satisfying, night.","Let me first say that Restaurant Domestic is a bit hard to find - you go into a courtyard off the main road and need to follow the signs. Not too hard, just a bit unexpected since it doesn't face the main road.

Even though it's a Michelin-starred restaurant, it seems very warm and casual. We started our evening on the outside porch, then moved in for the rest of our meal. The tables are well-spaced out - I don't know if that's a social distancing thing or just normal, but it made it seemed relaxed inside.

So the meal consisted of 18 courses/pairings (the ""discovery"" menu - they offer a shorter one with 11 - the ""insight"")! That seems huge, I know - but most of the items are 2-3 bites. You will leave full at the end of the night, though. You could pick from three drink pairings: juices/kombucha, classic wines, or ""curious"" wines. We went with the curious because why not? We had some very adventurous and non-traditional wines - like unusual grape varieties or unique fermentation methods. I don't think any of the wines were Danish; that rule only applies to the food, I guess.

All the food is sourced from Denmark, hence the name ""Domestic."" It's actually a pretty cool concept, as the chefs need to come up with unique pairings based on what is available locally and in season. You get a little bit of everything: seafood, beans, bread, flowers, fruits, meat. I really enjoyed the plaice/peas and the miso/koji pairings in particular. The platings are unique and little works of art. My husband and I enjoyed every minute of our meal and left feeling full, yet relaxed. Service was fantastic and shared by pretty much all of the waitstaff. It's expensive, but worth it.

Warning: don't plan on doing much else for the evening if you pick the full dinner experience. Our reservation was for 7 p.m. and we didn't leave until sometime around 11:30! Go with people you REALLY like spending time with.","3","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-08-05","2021-08-05","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r802006257-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"

All in all very good, but is it 1 star Michelin quality, on par with other cities like Barcelona, Lisbon or London? I very much have my doubts. My favourite dish was the little snacks, especially pork belly, served ""candy on the stick"" style. Snacks pairing with the unfiltered sparkly cider was fab.  In terms of the tasting 4 course, tartare of beef was bland, pork main also uninspiring, mushrooms too greasy. Local cod good, but nothing wow, though Jerusalem artichoke was fab. The most disappointing course was the bland dessert. Overall, an enjoyable experience, though I would probably stay away from the basic wine matching offer (so ordinary).

We had the 4 course meal, with 8 'snacks' and sourdough plus upgraded wine flight. Tge food was presented almost as pieces of art, containing home made and locally sourced aspects and great flavour combinations. The descriptions from wait staff were excellent considering English is not their first language. We had a very enjoyable evening but after 13 small courses, were very very full indeed!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/ec/3f/b3/20180927-205516-largejpg.jpg

I am a restaurant owner myself and chef.been eating many places in the world last being La pergola in Rome 3 Star Michelin restaurant.ad Heinz Beck. I think that this place has a lot of potential. the service through the evening was very Calming relaxing and completely out standing. it is something that I'm missing every single time I go out eat ad a Michelin restaurant it does not matter if it's one star two stars or three Stars the service and awareness will always be the most important for me when I go out to eat. If the food then is created well tasting beautiful plaited up  and we'll presented. you getting somewhere. This night everything of the above was presented here. I even have a chance to mix the wine that I preferred personally to the menu. Very well done I must say. You're getting 5 Stars from me and that I usually do not give. 

From a happy guest","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/d0/b2/b2/img-20180913-182520-largejpg.jpg

The ambiance is calming and pleasurable. The wine list is excellent with plenty of choices.

The only disappointing dish was the main meat course which was rather chewy. However the big let done was the tailing off of the service towards the end of the meal. We were so fed up we had to for the bill before the final dessert course was served. Shame but will not deter us from going again.","1","","FAMILY","2018-06-30","2018-06-22","2018-06-22","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r589701060-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"
