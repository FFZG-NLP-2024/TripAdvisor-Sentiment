Around 15 we was there,we sit outside in the beautiful outside area,in 5 min we ask for 2 prosecco wine,they didn't had at all. Ok,the waitress advise us for a rosè wine,without menù in our hand and without tell us the price,we said yes. Meanwhile we was drinking this tiny glass of wine,a guy from kitchen came to us and he start to explain us the philosophy of the restaurant and how they work there.he ask us if we wanted to had a tour of the kitchen and since we was chefs in a michelin star restaurant we said yes of course( there was absolutely nobody in the hotel when we were there,only staff). We had the tour and the guy from the kitchen was very nice and show us where they work and explain how they work.after he ask if we wanted something more and we decide to had a glass of snap that they made. Of course 2 second and it was gone. At the end we went to pay to the reception,another waiter came directly with the pos whitout any bill before and we paid 560 kr,for two glass of wine(not even fantastic) and two shot of snaps. If before i had a wondering to go there to have a dinner,now for sure i will never go inside that place,maybe the food it's delicious but that's stealing!

We did not regret this at all - amazing food from the pre-starters to the dessert. My favourite was the cod which was perfect. But the whole thing was just great.

We chose to have the wine pairing as well which worked perfectly and had some really great and interesting wines. 

The service was perfect - not too much, not too little. 

We were able to sit outside with a view over the water which also added to the great atmosphere. 

Thank you for a lovely afternoon which we ended with a quick walk.","2","","NONE","2020-08-31","2020-09-03","2020-09-03","en","Hotel Frederiksminde","4419609","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1931733-d4419609-r768552537-Hotel_Frederiksminde-Praestoe_Vordingborg_Municipality_South_Zealand_Zealand.html"

We went there for lunch and had the 6 course tasting menu, which proved to be a good choice. It started out with some excellent snacks and continued with equally excellent starters.

Congratulations!

You eat in a classical dining room overlooking the fjord, service is very good and the atmoaphere soothing.

They offer a tasting menu with a varying number of dishes (from 3 to 9), and the flexibility is nice considering how some restaurants these days only offer big tasting menus. Included in the menu is also lots of appetizers and some very impressing petir four (I find how some restaurants have replaced their petit four with a single chocolate or a small candy quite annoying), a nice gesture from the kitchen.

The menu is new nordic in inspiration, based on local produce, but also give out a nod or two to more continental cuisine (for instance by serving their take on the entrecôte - god bless them!), and while the food might not be life-altering and mindblowing (ate at Daniel Bärlin the previous night - wow), it's genuinelly tasty and very well excecuted. Some new combinations, like a delicious creme fraiche dessert and lovely asparagus was really good.

Summed up: high-quality food in a very relaxing atmosphere near Copenhagen, definetily recommended! Denmark are lucky to have these restaurants popping up all over the country!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/21/97/b7/photo0jpg.jpg

Lunch was ok, not overly impressive. Dinner had some very well thought out ideas and exiting components. Comparing it to other 1 star michelins I'm not sure it's all the way up there though. BUT - wine selection for the dinner was amazing and a perfect match
