The cuisine highlights many of the local vegetables as well as seasonal fish, seafood, and meats, and there is extra helpings of the 'crispy rice' at the end if you feel you need a bit more - served with Malden salt and a homemade sansho oil (the portions may look small but they are very filling).  We had some great dishes - the white miso soup was amazing - and the whole meal was an experience.

If you're in Kyoto and you want something a bit special -this is a first rate choice.","0","","FAMILY","2019-07-31","2019-08-05","2019-08-05","en","Soujiki Nakahigashi","1766589","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r695798583-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Also don’t miss out their speciality dish. Their specialty is white rice. You will understand how different between their white rice and others.

Amazing dishes delivered professionally and with great technical excellence. 

It’s yummy food in any context due to the combination of flavors and delicate preparation. 

It could be considered expensive if you don’t appreciate the effort that goes into sourcing amazing local ingredients and preparing them in a manner that honors their heritage. 
 
But it’s cheap if you do have some understanding of fresh produce, preparation and cooking to produce an incredible balance of tastes within each course. 

This is effectively a Japanese degustation and there were a couple of course that my wife and I wouldn’t have ordered a la Carte. But given that we enjoyed everything and the entire meal was well balanced. 

Don’t miss this restaurant if you’re a Foodie visiting Kyoto for only a few days. 

But you’ll need to book before you come as this place is almost always booked out.

We ate at several Michelin-starred restaurants across Japan, and Nakahigashi is extraordinary in the pack.  The chef's use of vegetables that he collects and his obvious desire to connect with diners are extraordinary.  We began the evening upstairs in a private room, but when 2 counter seats cleared, the chef invited us down and made us feel like part of the family. The food is on par with the hospitality.  I won't soon forget the white miso soup. We would go back in a heartbeat.","2","","COUPLES","2016-05-31","2016-05-17","2016-05-17","en","Soujiki Nakahigashi","1766589","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r373828353-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Food: 5","The NOMA of Japan Transforms Your Perspective on Food","The very best meal I had in Tokyo and Kyoto was here. It's a 2-star Michelin restaurant that is very hard to make a reservation (only about a dozen seats and a lot of regulars who make reservations in advance). However, if you can splurge and get in, then you'll be in for a treat of your life. Our hotel concierges (Ritz Carlton and the Yoshikawa Inn both tried for us) were able to get us on a waitlist and fortunately someone dropped out. Normally you need to book at least a month in advance.

The chef/owner goes and forages the mountain every day for fresh produce (it's basically the Japanese version of Noma). There's a heavy emphasis on the local vegetables and seasonality. There's also a bent towards seafood protein over land. There are so many courses and you'll leave full no matter how hungry you are. 

You can't really recommend a particular thing cause the menu changes so often but basically expect to taste whatever season you're in and the local flavors. Everything was just so beautifully presented and tasted like the embodiment of the season at its peak.

The chef tried his best to speak English to us and did a pretty good job actually of explaining the intricate dishes and their ingredients. Some of the regular patrons who had superior English helped out in explaining but it's clear that they don't get as many non-Japanese guests as Japanese guests. But they were all very kind and helpful, which made the whole evening so wonderful to share the experience with such kind strangers.

You can tell the chef takes enormous pride in his food and has a lot of confidence in his skills -- as he should. 

In the end, the chef even walked us out to our taxi and gave us his business card which was a very nice touch. I will remember this experience forever as truly magical and as having transformed my perspective on Japanese cuisine and what's possible.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/a0/97/66/sojiki-nakahigashi.jpg

We were so lucky somebody cancelled the day before so we could get in. We were also lucky his cute son was in the country since he could explain all the courses in detail in fluent English. They did not offer alcoholic beverages right away, we had to ask for them, they don't have a drinks menu. What makes it even more authentic. So glad afterwards, when we got the bill, their sakes were at very normal prices. Also the incredible, typical Japanese courtesy by the chef and his son to follow us outside and greeting us at the taxi door. Important to know: this is natural cuisine, not cooking special combinations like French top cuisine, which remains therefore a higher category than the Japanese, as far as I am concerned. Still absolutely worth it!","2","","COUPLES","2015-05-31","2015-06-05","2015-06-05","en","Soujiki Nakahigashi","1766589","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r278130838-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Atmosphere: 4","A true display of kaiseki, masterful and at times genius","Having been unable to secure a booking at some of the more sought after Kaiseki in Kyoto such as the legendary Mizai and unwilling to fork out for Kitcho - we decided to try a Kaiseki that was rated highly by the locals on Tabelog and also rated by the Michelin guide at 2 stars. 

I must premise this review in saying that three of the four members present for the meal had never tried Kaiseki.  I will keep this review relatively brief and highlight the best and worst.

Food - First dish with a selection of mountain flowers, local fish, and vegetables was out of this world. The flavours and textures contained within a single dish in every single element of the plate demonstrated an exceptional understanding of both produce and the combination of flavours. Together, it demonstrates a level of precision and thinking that few chefs have. Easily a very solid 3 star dish. 

Many of the other dishes after this were excellent. The clear broth, the crispy fish bones, the old style mackerel ""cheese"" sushi. A great deal of these were solid 2 if not 3 star dishes. 

However, some of  the other dishes in the middle received mixed feelings from the party. Some such as the carp with vegetables were extremely pungent and powerful - and whether it was excellent or terrible could be based on personal preference. Later dishes such as the salted river fish was also excessively salty and the 'breakfast' plate confounded the party. One party member suggested that the meal had become too intense. 

However the ending showed Nakahigashi's genius in understanding flavours and textures. The dessert of a sake sorbet over grapefruit with a slice of dried fig and a piece of dark chocolate was a flash of genius. The balance of the mild cold sake against the texture and slight bitterness of the grapefruit already represented a high level of gastronomic understanding. The addition of the sweet but dried fig and the dark chocolate added a new dimension to the dish. The ability to create such an incredible marriage of flavours and textures from just four ingredients is  truly remarkable. This simple dessert is truly one of the best, if not the best dish i've ever eaten. 

Food - Overall the food was incredible. Although there were some mistakes, some dishes were simply mind blowing. The quality, skill and thought would give this place a solid 2.5 stars. 

Service - Extremely well received. Nakahigashi made an effort to speak in english to us and made sure we were well taken care of. The wife? was very thoughtful. Small things like spilt broth was cleaned from placemats between every course. Overall service was 3 stars. 

Ambience/Atmosphere - Nice traditional counter top seating allowed us front row seats to preparation. Very clean. In context of japan, would rate interior/ambience at 2 stars. 

Value - at 70k Yen for 4 people this was a very memorable kaiseki experience and I consider this relatively good value. 

Overall - Excellent food and excellent service. Solid 2 michelin star restaurant. If several dishes from the middle had been removed I might even have thought this was 3 star level.","7","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/69/b1/a4/sojiki-nakahigashi.jpg

We also ordered additional Matsutake rice which was Devine. The price was very reasonable for Kaiseki, and was around 8,0000 yen per person for base, and we ended up around 13'000 yen each with some additions.
