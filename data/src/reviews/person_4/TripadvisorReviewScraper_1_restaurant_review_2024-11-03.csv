Food: 5","A pleasant surprise","My husband booked this place to celebrate my birthday with me. It was a cosy little restaurant with a semi open kitchen to enable guests to see the chef and the fleet in action. 

All courses are with unexpectedly interesting presentation. This however in no way compromise the quality of the food.  The petite four was particularly worth mentioning -  they played a little game with guests at the end - to spot the edible stone like chocolate from a plate mixed with rel stones. 

The service was impressive too.

Definitely falls within  the ""i will be back"" list","0","","COUPLES","2017-06-30","2018-05-01","2018-05-01","en","Sincere","12086712","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14131014-d12086712-r577101891-Sincere-Sendagaya_Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"
