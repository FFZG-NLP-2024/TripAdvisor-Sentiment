We had a great evening this time. The weather in September was summery, so we started out on their terrace, and as the temperature was still high, we continued outdoors.
The dishes were innovative, but above all extremely tasty. We had a greek rosé wine for the whole dinner and it actually worked pretty well.
Very nice staff with personal service.
Can highly recommend.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-08","2024-09-08","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r968891664-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"

From the moment we arrive you can feel the family and cozy atmosphere. We are so lucky to have a warm sunshine evening so we start the evening out in their cosy atmospheric backyard. We choose the great experience with the Danish drink menu and we will not regret it!
From the food on the plate to what we get in the glasses you can feel the red thread and that it is thought down to the smallest detail. 
We get the feeling of being on a magical journey through Denmark, from the gold in the sea to delicious fresh raw materials from the fields and trees. The menu contains many different flavors and experiences ranging from the feeling of digging the new potatoes out of the garden to finding oysters by the sea or seeing the big bison on the field.
The whole experience ended perfectly in their cozy wine cellars with coffee and sweet where you can let everyone impressive down in the soft chairs.

The experience was ⁇  no less amazing because it was served by extremely attentive and sweet waiters as well as the skilled and charismatic chefs who serve with a smile and great passion for their crafts.

All in all, Restaurant Domestic is not just a dinner, but an unforgettable experience. It is a tribute to Danish gastronomy and a reminder of how much wealth our local ingredients can offer when treated with respect and creativity. A night at Domestic is a journey through taste, tradition and innovation – a journey we are sure looking forward to taking again.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d8/ea/6a/caption.jpg

The atmosphere was exceptionally pleasant, immediately setting a cozy mood. The team was incredibly friendly and attentive, which made the evening even more enjoyable. A special highlight was the excellent wine pairing. The selection of Danish wines was impressive and paired perfectly with the dishes served. We were particularly thrilled by the quality and diversity of the Danish wines introduced to us. The restaurant's concept of focusing on local and sustainable products was reflected not only in the food but also in the overall philosophy of the establishment. This approach is not only commendable but also contributed to the uniqueness of our culinary experience. In short, a visit to Restaurant Domestic is in a class of its own and leaves nothing to be desired.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/19/b5/ca/caption.jpg

Sustainable Michelin star eating","So my boyfriend took me out to this restaurant as a surprise birthday present, and we had the absolute best time! Everything from the service to the food, was Michelin star quality. My favourite meal I had was the dumplings with the puffed up flatbread and smoked cheese inside - so if you get that you’re lucky!! Also I recommend trying the rhubarb gin it’s super delicious! 

What I love about the place particularly is its ethos - everything is bought locally and all comes from Denmark and they do seasonal eating / depending on what they can find determines what food they cook. It’s great and very sustainable! 

Ok finally, a shout out to our waitresses who looked after us, and especially to Inês who really made our night with her extensive knowledge of wine and general happy and friendly demeanour. Thank you to all Domestic staff and chefs!! :)","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/a3/89/c9/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 3","Uneven experience with dizzying highs and incomprehensible lows","The restaurant is cozy and beautifully unpretentiously decorated in relation to the fact that we are at Michelin level. You immediately feel at home and comfortable...

... so why are some of the waiters on the other hand so stiff in their covers that, paradoxically, you still feel like you've been prepared for a royal table with powdered wigs in the 18th century - and in the opposite ditch, why is the banal Danish pop music turned up so loud that it can be difficult to hear the English-speaking waiters' pronunciation of the difficult foreign food terms…?

As a guest, you quickly realize that the owners of Domestic very consciously play on the contrasts; one will go to great lengths not to be labeled as mainstream. Better to seem strange than to be accused of stroking the guests' hair.

And right must be right: Sometimes practice made perfect; the food hits an otherworldly level, so that you are completely blown away. A steamed oyster (!) with seaweed and capers - and a crispy fried block of French fries Anna with juicy mussels - are a couple of the best snacks we have ever tasted. Wow, just wow!

But then some Japanese vegetable hits the plate, drifting from deep-frying and with little dabs of a completely sexless miso dressing, and suddenly there is an infinite long way up to the Michelin star.

It was almost worse with the wine menu. We grabbed the 'cheap' one and here got a disappointing sense of stinginess - one of the wines, for example, should be enough for 3-4 dishes (you had to spit in the glass to make the relatively small glass of white wine stretch). Several of the mineral white wines resembled each other too much and often matched the food poorly.

The juice menu was better. In particular, a cucumber drink with a bit of milk added - and a sea buckthorn with green chilli - made each one happy and emphasized the flavors in the dishes they had to match.

By far the majority was good this evening, some servings were even on a par with, for example, Geranium or Noma (the latter could remind Domestic of a light version). Still, it can only be 3 stars, because some of the dishes fell through the cracks, and the lack of generosity is completely unheard of when 2 people have to spend a little over DKK 6,000 for an evening where we had chosen the 'cheap' wine menu and a juice menu.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/3b/e4/e3/caption.jpg

This included 10 small courses with accompanying wine. The experience took around three hours. The food was exceptional, innovative, and had expert flavor combinations that were delightfully unexpected. Service was really fantastic with kind, funny, and thoroughly knowledgable guides! It was the highlight food experience of our Denmark trip. Also, the space is charming, warm, and intimate - both on the inside and outside seating.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/04/71/fe/caption.jpg

However this time they did not match my expectations. The menu and the wine menu didn't bring the best out in each other and the taste sensation we were left with was sour and the odour putrid. The end result was indigestion.

The staff was as always alert and competent and the  servings was  beautifully presented - that is the only reason it is not a 1 star review. 

I had the sensation that the owner is making a lot of experiments which is great, however he have forgotten the saying ""kill your darlings"" - it might be a fun and unique experiment but that doesn't mean it is good. An example was the homemade sparkling apple based ""wine"".  If Domestic  is unable to match existing products in the market (f.ex. Andersen on Djursland) or the product doesn't meet Domestic standards then don't allow it on the menu.","0","","COUPLES","2021-12-31","2021-12-19","2021-12-19","en","Restaurant Domestic","8824508","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189530-d8824508-r822438403-Restaurant_Domestic-Aarhus_East_Jutland_Jutland.html"

The kitchen is still very dogmatic and experimental but I found it to less ""over-the-edge"" this time than on previous visits; like they are more rooted in their concept. The menu was still very exiting but each dish came with a depth that I hadn't experienced before. They certainly did seem to have a beedrock of confidence in the way the food was presented. 

Still visually beautiful creations. The snack w. duck heart, lobster tail and grilled purple cale was out of this world. The best dish was the celariac w. mussels. Halibut w. flowers and sauce was visually stunning and flavourful and the duck was cooked to perfection. 

Wine list is rather extensive and I found the ratio between natural and more conventional wines to be more balanced than previously. And reasonably priced in terms of Danish prices. 

Services as always very attentive and down-to-earth polite. 

Will definitely be back.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/21/8c/88/58/snacks-note-the-duck.jpg
