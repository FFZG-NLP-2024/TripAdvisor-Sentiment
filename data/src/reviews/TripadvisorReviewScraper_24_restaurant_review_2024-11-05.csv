We were therefore gratified to see that Mural was fully booked during our visit, and we very much enjoyed our  meal, the wine pairings, the service, and the atmosphere. Although we normally do not review restaurants, in this case we wanted to offset those negative reviews with our own experience.

Though small and bistro-like, with a casual ambience, the service was impeccable, very much in keeping with Michelin starred restaurants. Each course was thoughtfully prepared using a wide range and combination of ingredients, focusing on fish, vegetables, meat, and finally on a creative and delicious dessert. We found the courses innovative, with servers providing details about each course as it was presented. Similarly, the sommelier matched the food perfectly with German, Austrian, and French wines, providing details about each winery and the grapes used. 

We found the prices at Mural similar to other Michelin restaurants, the tasting menu at Mural offering excellent value for the quality provided.

We would definitely return to Mural ; we hope that other diners are not put off by what seem to be very superficial negative reviews, some of which were provided in covid times, and hence during very unusual circumstances.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-06","2024-06-06","en","Mural","12718520","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r953982673-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

All dishes served by 6 different people and majority with no passion or enthusiasm to explain what’s been served. Everything was just proper. But nothing was exceptional.

It was very very expensive, but there were six in the kirchen, four front of house and only thirteen in the restaurant. Really surprising combinations expertly managed, and good flight of winbes to accompany the food. There were five unannounced ameuses geules including a maginficient dish with a beetroot sauce and horseradish granita; four petit fours including the best raspberry 'gummy bear'.

Restaurant is inside a museum which is quite extraordinary.  Furnishing fairly sparse and minimalistic.  

However the food was anything but simple.  I’d even go as far as exquisite.  We opted for the seven course dinner and certainly didn’t disappoint.  

All courses were beautifully balanced in terms of taste and colour.  Absolutely amazing. Wine selection however did not really have lots of German options which is quite baffling.

Food: 4","Michelin star with a twist","Mural is located in the Museum of Urban & Contemporary Art and is a little ""different"" of a starred Michelin restaurant. The setting is informal, the staff is relaxed and equally informal, it is relatively loud (but not noisy).. produce for the dishes are almost exclusively locally sourced, which is commendable. There is a single tasting menu at 155 €.  The dishes are pretty inventive in terms of combination of ingredients and flavours, but the chef manages to convince with what might appear as somewhat contrived combinations to many. The sommelier likes to point out that many available wines are not on the wine list, so we asked for one of those, and the German Sylvaner (alas forgot the producer) he recommended was good, and fairly priced.","1","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-07-30","2021-07-29","en","Mural","12718520","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r800608763-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

Food: 5","Really good star experience in Munich","excellent Michelin star restaurant in the center of Munich.

It is a lot less formal than other star restaurants in Munich, such as the Schwarzereiter. It has more of a Berlin vibe to it. Nevertheless, the experience is absolutely great.

We went for lunch and took the 5 courses menu, which was just enough, not too much food. I liked everything they brought to us, but the fish (perch) and the meat where just astounding.

In terms of drinks, they have a really nice selection of wines. You can go with Augustiner if you want to as well. We had a schnapps in the end that was really really tasty, though really pricy.

In terms of price, it's about what you can expect for a 1-star. The menu is cheaper if you go for lunch, by the way.

The only thing I didn't quite like: The chairs were a bit uncomfortable.","2","","NONE","2020-10-31","2020-10-25","2020-10-25","en","Mural","12718520","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r775509504-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

On the last night of our stay I asked for a 'surprise' restaurant from the concierge and her exact words were, ""You need to go to Mural before they get their first Michelin rating"". So that evening we were off to find Mural.

Be warned that it is a little hard to find off a smaller back street and when you walk in it's not a grand restaurant with lots of money spent on furnishings. It's a small understated restaurant with young chef's doing something you do not expect in Munich. They are making crafted and creative tasting menus comparable to some of the best restaurants in the world. 

I have eaten at Maido, Astrid y Gaston, La Mar, Rafael, and Central in Lima, Peru. Borago in Santiago, Chile. All are considered in the top 200 restaurants in the world and I have to say that the little startup 'Mural' rivals them in creativity and potential.

We asked to be surprised with the 8 course tasting menu with wine pairing. We were not disappointed. Like the best restaurants today, the ingredients were locally sourced throughout the Bavarian region. Each course was impeccably presented and the taste was equally satisfying. Woflgang explained each course and explained the wine pairing chosen with each course. 

The guys at Mural are very creative and if you like the experience of a tasting menu, as opposed to a couple of BIG course for dinner, I highly recommend Mural. I think the concierge was right about the Michelin rating. Once this place is discovered by a larger audience it will get more and more attention.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/71/a1/97/mural.jpg

Thoughtful ingredient combinations included white asparagu, mini trumpet mushrooms, strawberries marinated in mescal and kohlrabi ash.

Wine pairings were creative and adventurous - I am no sommelier, but was very impressed with the marriage of food and grape.  Always fun to learn about esoteric German and French wines, and the team delighted with surprises including a beetroot digestiv.

The Mosaic team clearly has chemistry and enjoy their craft.  Head chef Luke visited with us three times to provide color as to his creative process and tasting notes.

We enjoyed dinner immensely - so impressed with food quality, culinary skills and the warmth and knowledge of the staff.

Good food. Sometimes too many different flavors on one plate. Very large wine list but French-heavy. There is certainly room for improvement. For example, a Jumilla. Very attentive and friendly staff! It was a great evening.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/33/60/bb/caption.jpg

Because the recommendation of the GM we consulted online sounded great and because luckily we were apparently able to get the last table for two, we chose Mural. What can I say, we didn't regret it.
As Berliners, we were initially surprised when we entered the restaurant: Mural is/was ""actually"" the Muca museum bistro and the interior design is the best shabby chic à la Berlin-Mitte, just like at home! The toilets are a little further away in Wedding or Friedrichshain (on the corner that hasn't yet been gentrified). The staff would also fit in in Berlin, but only at first glance, because behind the relaxed ""Berlin look"" there was not only super friendly and service-oriented staff (neither of which would be the norm in Mitte), but the sommelier in particular was not only knowledgeable, but also took great pleasure in explaining his selection, without lecturing, wonderful! The wine accompaniment was very Jura and natural wine-heavy (there is also a small but fine wine menu with wine by the glass, especially for rarities and GGs, and an extensive bottle wine menu), which doesn't really excite me, but here I have to admit that the combination with the respective course was pretty good. In general, the food: modern, but not forced, delicious, handcrafted and visually convincing. We were delighted across the board, only the cheese sauce for the mountain trout was a bit too hard, the delicious mountain cheese practically flattened the actually even more delicious fish. The rest, especially the pikeperch and the venison, were great. If it wasn't so far away, I would like to come more often.","2","","BUSINESS","2023-10-31","2023-11-09","2023-11-09","en","Mural","12718520","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r925285297-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Great kitchen and concept - Chef / Cheffe de Service nonexistent, confusion","+a convincing concept, very interesting dishes, very well-crafted, excellent products. 
+modern, industrial style, few tables 
+lively, but not too loud. 
+friendly and motivated waiters and waitresses (but they seemed overwhelmed to me, some of them were running around...)
+cooks (not the boss) presented their dishes themselves, but one cook was extremely disinterested, just recited her little verse, an embarrassing moment (also strange that she wasn't wearing chef's trousers, but private (?) jeans).
+sommelier: knowledgeable, friendly, funny. Good recommendation, clear price information (verbally) before ordering. A top man! 
- no wine list (the sommelier said he was the wine list) - you can do that, but I would have liked to have had an impression of the selection
- service was not very organized - who was responsible for us? Changed several times. we also had to point out after the greeting and the first course that we would like to order a wine (otherwise we would have just had an empty glass of sparkling wine and water...), everything got pretty hectic. 
- the (sweet) dessert came without warning before the cheese course, even though we had chosen the cheese immediately beforehand (it was then explained that the kitchen could then clean up earlier); order is not a dogma for me, but this could have been announced, which is usually done, but was forgotten in our case (see above); sweet wine was kindly offered, but then we went back to the red wine and the cheese...

Conclusion: There was a lack of a head waiter/chef who had an overview. Amazing for such good cuisine and such a good concept. But I would go again.","2","","COUPLES","2023-07-31","2023-08-08","2023-08-08","en","Mural","12718520","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d12718520-r908832478-Mural-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"
