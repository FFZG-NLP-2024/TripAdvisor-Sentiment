I feel a great place with a great rustic environment but with amazing surprises on the food and amazing set of glasses and dishes.

We have a chance to see how everything was prepared and I can describe how good was everything. This kind of food is not the daily one but it is a composition of flavours combined with textures on a proper way moving to a new way. Probably will come back on important moments on my life because really everything was perfect.

It surprises me every time with great & new gourmet & service. It makes a lot sense & reason why it is Michelin starred for more than 10 years consecutively from the gourmet creativities as well as wine pairing. This time I have too many new dishes plus the signature ones. The sardine in all forms with rosemary smoke, the molecular scallops, the goose liver with cauliflower paste & sauce, truffle with slow cooked pI grin and the signature vinegar cucumber & molecular oyster. The ending ice cream surprised us by its combination of tea sorbet & many flavors. Service is perfect with great explanation. Definitely always an adventure & enjoyment in its gastronomy tour. 
很多年了，一年至少來一次。每次來都因為新菜和一流服務而大為驚訝，難怪是超過十年的連年得獎米其林餐廳，因為他創意又紮實的美食、配酒和服務，這次又都是新菜，沙丁魚解構後配上rosemary的煙，分子解構的帶子，鵝肝配上白花椰菜湯及醬，松露佐低溫烹調的鴿子肉，還有他著名的醋黃瓜和蚵仔氮氣粒，甜點的冰淇淋也讓我們驚豔因為加上茶的冰沙和其他味道而超好吃又不甜，服務一流，說菜完美，每次來都變成美食的探索和非常享受。

We had the menu and got 12 courses. El Molino really cares about the presentation so all dishes are just stunning. The cook knows his stuff: some dishes are classic nouvelle cuisine - probably to show that he can also do boring - but most courses are experimental, molecular cuisine. Some of the experiments were not really my thing (the pinewood smoked foie was too much resiny to supplement the buttery richness of the foie) but many other dishes were revelations. Little frozen green pearls that taste like mussels/oysters to name just one aspect of a marvellous dish where leek (!) plays the leading role. The drinks are not included. Their bread is great. They say they make it themselves but I have a feeling they get it from this wonderful bakery in Gorraiz...

It is in the countryside with easy free parking in an old refitted stone building by the roadside. Do not let the simple stone building  fool you. Inside is one of the best restaurants in the whole central Pyrennees. They have a fix price menu with perhaps too many servings but also have a short carte with outstanding offering of classical regional dishes refined without bizarre touches of molecular cuisine. Their smoke foie is the best example.You cannot miss with either the fish or meat choices. The wine selection is very good and the prices reasonable, for this type of restaurant. Only the prices of the dessert choices were out of proportion to their content. Otherwise the modernized rustic interior and the efficient service make the experience a most pleasant scape from the noise and cramped quarters of the other good choices withing Pamplona city limits.","0","","FRIENDS","2016-04-30","2016-04-19","2016-04-19","en","El Molino de Urdániz","3584780","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r365337005-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html"

Food: 5","1 of 3 Michelin Rated Restaurants in the area and Well Deserved","I came to Pamplona during the festival of San Fermin, but running the bulls, although a MUST experience, was not the highlight of our trip.  The Mill at Urdaniz claims that honor.  Chef David Yarnoz is BRILLIANT!  We were greeted at the door by Javier and Isabella, and the welcome could not have been warmer.  We were given a choice of seating and selected the more formal dining area upstairs.  The menu was in Spanish, and we as American tourists were lacking in that area, so the Chef sent a young sous chef to our table to translate.  As a party of six, all but one selected the tasting menu priced at 70 Euros.  The courses that followed were the highlight of our trip.  Isabella, the matron of the establishment (and I surmise the mother of the talented Chef David Yarnoz) was gracious to a degree that I have never experienced as a patron.  There was a language barrier for us and she and the wait staff assisted in a way that one would have expected at a place like Charlie Trotter's if you were Spanish and spoke no English.  Every detail was covered and we all felt like the whole team pulled together to ensure our experience was exquisite, and it was.  All of the courses were regionally designed to make it a true local gastronomic experience, and if I ever return to Pamplona this will be the first thing I book.  The charming old mill is located approx. 20 minutes outside of town, and it provided us with a wonderful opportunity to take a step back from the hectic atmosphere of San Fermin and spend a quiet evening among friends, one that will never be forgotten.  Great wine, Excellent food, and an atmosphere conducive to a long social meal with friends.  Thank you Chef David, Isabella, and Javier for adding so much value to our Pamplona experience of a lifetime.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/4f/fa/16/intro-course-chorizo.jpg

We reserved for lunch on Easter Sunday. It was a dreary day when we left Pamplona and headed up into the hills, you follow the National road which heads toward the French border. The restaurant is located on the bend before you enter the village of Urdaniz. A quaint stone build, which must have been the Windmill in a former life. Inside, downstairs there is a local restaurant, which was doing a brisk trade.

The more formal area is upstairs, with its exposed beams, neutral tones, it is a pleasant environment for what was an excellent lunch. From the gin & tonic starter, which melted on the tongue to the wonderfully chocolate laden dessert, there were some courses which could be described as ""samey"", on the whole the meal was excellent, the service charming, unobtrusive & knowledgeable. There was also a more than adequate wine list.  Well worth the short drive out of town.","1","","FAMILY","2014-04-30","2015-02-08","2015-02-08","en","El Molino de Urdániz","3584780","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r253185280-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html"

They gave us a list with keywords of the dishes we were about to enjoy, but until they reach the table, you do not know what you will eat.

The explanation is brief, but complete, they do not give you an existential talk of the motivations of the cook when it comes to inspiration, it is simply haute cuisine, technique purified by years of work and an obvious commitment, for good doing.
Delight in each of the 14 passes, in a very well-kept environment, with Top-rated ingredients in the area.

The dishes are the protagonists, arrive at the table well timed, served professionally, direct from the kitchen you have in sight.

David Yárnoz, was there and kindly called (with great subtlety) our son, to show him in situ, how he gets one of his most memorable dishes.

In short, cuisine that reconciles with the experience of eating in a great restaurant, which is, by itself without postures or stridency.
Congratulations to the whole team.","0","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-20","2024-08-20","en","El Molino de Urdániz","3584780","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r965787605-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html"

Not in vain, it is the only restaurant in the world with two Michelin stars (that I know of) that does not offer different appetizer passes, live dishes or in the kitchen and all the paraphernalia of this type of restaurant.
The tasting menu is made up of 14 preparations (€155), all masterful and surprising at the same time. A festival of flavors that is difficult to match.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-17","2024-05-17","en","El Molino de Urdániz","3584780","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r951215597-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html"

We were cold and separated from the rest.
That's a table to have a skewer in front of the bar.
That's why I value it low.
