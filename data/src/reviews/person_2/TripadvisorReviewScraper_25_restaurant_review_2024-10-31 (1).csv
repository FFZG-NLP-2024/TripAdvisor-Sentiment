Sadly, it wasn’t the experience we were expecting as 13 of the 15 courses were vegetarian which we did not expect. Don’t mind some vegetarian courses but not 90 %. The paired wines included 8 wines of which 6 were unfiltered which again one or two unfiltered would be fine hence not what we were expecting. Portion sizes were off the scale poor and even the flavour and quality of produce was way below expectation mostly bland. Having eaten in many Michelins  based restaurants .. 360 and Proto in Dubrovnik, Sukaldean and Bernard Extea in San Sebastien to name a few where quality of food and overall experience was truly Michelin. This experience was sadly our worst experience of a Michelin based restaurant hence fell way below expectation as food is a key element of any dining experience which was unbelievably poor in this case. Given we were in Hungary we expected some form of Goulash would have been on the menu given claims of local produce!! The only plus was the service. Finally, the price was staggeringly  out of sync with the food quality and wines hence as much as I hate to say it, it was a complete ripoff as one of the courses was bread n butter to fill us up as the previous and future courses would have left us still hungry.

We feel totally ripped off paying more than 600 € for 2 persons. The wine pairing with small local wineries, which maybe did not find any decent place to sell their products was a tasting disaster. 

All in all for that kind of money you can treat yourself 4 nights out in the many nice restaurants in Budapest.

During the 15 courses which I think is a bit exaggerated because some of the ""dishes"" are so small that you almost can't taste them, we had 2-3 highlights. The bread for 1 of the dishes was maybe the best bread ever eaten. The mushroom dish was also very good. Rest of the dishes was average and a couple was not tasty. When it comes to the wine paring, we had local wines, there were many highlights. We had one small dish we couldn't eat and to be honest at this level of dining we expected that they would come up with some extra for us but they didnt. Overall a good experience but many of the dishes are too small. Myself I just get irritated to get dishes that are at this size. So maybe based on the price and expectations of this kind of restaurant it should get a 3/5 but the wine paring gives it a 4/5. 210.000 forint are expensive for a couple. Had much better food experiences from a 1 star restaurant before.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/c2/cc/c3/caption.jpg

My wife is lactose-free and pescatarian, and I chose a pescatarian menu. Both menus were adapted with great thought, impressive creativity, and care, with neither of us feeling as if we had missed out on anything. Substitutions and adaptations were carefully explained. All staff were extremely knowledgable and took great effort to explain the dishes and to reassure us that my wife’s menu had no lactose. Highly recommended.

Atmosphere: 3","Exquisite taste of Hungary","Exquisite and indulgent - but the multiple courses were all very clean, with a focus on local ingredients, and they had a vegetarian option for my wife which made this place stand out. 

First off we did find it slightly uncomfortable (it's not a discreet dining experience, but rather interactive, with tables near each other and facing to the open room, and other couples within earshot). The  requisite presentation was a little florid, and they make a lot of spectacle about the chef's personal stories etc - but they did a good job with it overall. Waiters didn't always look comfortable standing around either but they were speedy and the service was good.  Eventually we did get into the swing of things and relaxed a bit during the meal (helped by excellent local natural wines and lemonades). 
Not cheap but also not on the crazy side of the price spectrum of Michelin restaurants. It appeared that this was the most sustainable of them all in Budapest, which I also appreciated. Recommended.

Food: 5","The Best Dinner in Budapest","Opened in 2019 SALT is considered by many to be Budapest's best Restaurant, its location in a boutique hotel called RUM featuring warm wood tones surrounding an open kitchen with most plates finished at a pass in front.

Led by Chef Szilárd Tóth and Manager Máté Boldizsár with service comparable to the world’s best, many dishes telling a tale of Hungarian heritage, SALT relies on ideas akin to “new Nordic” fare with foraging and fermentation at the forefront while Beverages look to local or natural Wines plus Juices made to pair.

A “story-teller’s” tasting, fifteen courses plus additions on both ends delivered at an appropriate pace, it is with Kombucha that guests are invited to taste a bundle of Herbs dragged through Carp Milt plus Celeriac and Fish in a Tuile before moving on to blanched White Asparagus lent acidity by a Dip of Nettles and Ants.

Plated Scandinavian but distinctly Hungarian in terms of terroir, one-bite “Greasy bread” hearty but balanced with Eel instead of Jowl Bacon, Cauliflower comes charred next to Walnut Cream that leads well into Cheese topped with micro-planed Pork Heart.

Contemporary with roots in local ingredients and rural dishes, the casual environment adding to the sense of dining at a friend’s house, Tóth’s “Chicken of the Woods Mushroom” comes in aromatic Corn Miso prior to a refreshing “Gin & Tonic” Bite composed in the kitchen.

Choosing another Juice going forward, Lime and Strawberry accented by Bay Leaf holding up to Soup and Bread made for dipping, a second plate in the same vein references a peasant dish from Pécs rethought with Foie Gras and Duck Heart in hearty Broth.

Pumping the breaks with raw local Trout in an ice bowl, acidic like Aguachiles but lacking Chiles, Potatoes in Duck Fat proves to be an elegant setup for sticky Pork Ribs intended to be eaten as a Lettuce Wrap topped in fermented foraged Greens. 

Outpacing the single Michelin Star received in 2021, a Cheese course adjacent Chestnut Honey and Pine transitioning to sweet, SALT’s Rice Pudding with Chamomile is an exercise in restraint that fully engages the palate before finishing with floral Matcha and a quartet of Petit Four.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/8a/f5/71/caption.jpg

Almost every dish was perfect. Service was top notch. Make sure you get a table that allows full view of the kitchen. Despite our early reservation months before we first got seated at a large table in the back but upon complaining politely we switched towards a kitchen view table. Amazing and worth 2 Michelin stars IMO. Would travel to Budapest only to eat here again.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/0a/b8/e7/caption.jpg

Food: 5","Best of Budapest ","Deserving of all the attention and praise from it's star. All the courses were beautifully presented with attention to detail and the service was perfectly choreographed. With prior warning during our reservation, they delivered a extravagant vegetarian course for one person in our party. 

The menu changes seasonally and has a lot of fermented flavors, and less obsessive about heavy fats as compared to other fine dining. It's a long tasting menu and paced to fill you up. We opted away from the wine pairing and they offered a delightful pairing of homemade juices. Some of the juices were highly unorthodox, but each was immaculately paired to the uniqueness of the course in front of you. 

My only negative opinions would be the chef is leaning-in on the sustainability angle a little too hard in the protein department. Also for a 3.5-4 hour seating, the chairs they are using for their 2-person tables is woefully inadequate in the comfort department. The service, glassware, and presentation were all multi-star experience, but the soft touches seemed to be lacking. 

All considered they delivered exactly on what they promised and we'll be back. ","0","","COUPLES","2023-05-31","2023-05-07","2023-05-07","en","Salt","19095453","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r889334843-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html"

Food: 5","Transcendent ","I came to Salt with my girlfriend just to try it out, and we were blown away. We don't always enjoy stuffy, regimented fine dining experiences, but our initial apprehension (we had just seen the movie the Menu, and were reminded of this) was immediately suppressed by the quiet courtesy and professionalism of the staff, and a stunning sequence of dishes that catered to both of us (my girlfriend is a vegetarian, and the vegetarian versions of the menu delivered completely too).

For this, I specifically wanted something that focused on sustainable food, farm to table, or a cuisine that didn't make me feel like I was eating somewhere that was importing lobster from Maine into a landlocked country over thousands of miles. This reminds more of the style of modern Scandinavian cuisine, with very pure and earthy flavors, local produce and meat, and the chefs and various servers presented a story with each course that reflected the desire for homegrown fare, and also completely delivered. 

I can't really describe a standout dish - I can only say that dish after dish was completely delicious, and oftentimes hitting the peak of flavor combinations that made our brains go mushy with euphoria. 

It's the best restaurant I have tried in Budapest. It is certainly an expense (roughly 400-500 euro for 2 people), but if you are into a full, hours-long food experience it, it is worth the money and the time. 

My one criticism was the layout of the place - as I diner II felt somewhat exposed and at first uncomfortable, rather than tucked into a romantic or private space with a partner, even with the view of the kitchen, which was very nice.

It is small with only ten tables so booking well in advance is the only chance to enjoy a meal here.
The fixed menu relies on Hungarian traditions and many special local ingredients, many coming from the village where the chef grew up. It also includes many unusual ingredients for Hungarian kitchen such as snails once favored by wealthy noble families and now extinct from tables. For foreigners probably best to visit with a Hungarian who undoubtedly will relate many childhood stories to some of the food served. The wines in the wine pairing are mostly biodynamic and natural so unless favoring such flavours, probably better to choose from the wine menu. A truly memorable experience that is best begun or ended in the rooftop bar of the hotel where the restaurant also is located.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/fb/b1/52/caption.jpg
