Exceptional!","One of the best experiences of my life! Fantastic food, wine and service! And the room was so inviting and set the stage for the meal. 

Angel greeted us and wrapped up our evening with such grace and style - set the mood right out of the gate! Arnaud and Florian were exceptional! Everything they suggested, including the wine was truly amazing and a great pairing! And Moose’s delivery of the fish - not only was it a great presentation but such a wonderful meal! 

And then at the end of the night after all the amazing food, wine,  service and atmosphere the chef came out to meet us, ask us about our dinner and thank us for coming. 

Such a special night - highly recommend this amazing one of a kind place! A special thanks to Chef Alain Passard! Truly fantastic! 5 Stars!!!!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/da/b9/aa/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","L'Arpege","718128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r974867380-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 3","Michelin worthy - but not 3*","The food was amazing - you will not be disappointed with the fantastic flavors that you never thought possible with vegetarian food.  However, for a 3* restaurant, the ambiance and experience leave much to be desired.  We were seated in a small, cramped basement.  For me or my wife to rise from the table, the waitstaff had to come and move the table so we could get up.  There were plenty of times when our water or wine glasses ran dry, the crumbs were not cleaned from our tablecloth, my wife's napkin wasn't folded when she left the table, and several other minor things that would not matter at all were we not used to better experiences at other 3* places.  The next night, we went to Pierre Gagnaire, for example, and experienced an truly 3* dinner and experience.  L'Arpege was a notch (or two) below.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-05","2024-08-05","en","L'Arpege","718128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r963359439-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Amazing flavors, but not a bar raising experience","NOTE: the rating given is relative to other 3 Michelin star restaurants I have eaten at worldwide. 

Alain Passard is a genius when it comes to flavors. To me, this was the 3-star surprise of the evening: At times underwhelming looking dishes that, when tried, were an explosion on the palate. Using freshly-farmed in-season vegetables are key to the flavors. The chef merely combines them in the most perfect way. Still, I expected more out of the ordinary for a 3-star restaurant and, to be honest, some dishes – based on looks and technique – would easily be served at any average restaurant. Take for example the salad. Completely unassuming until you try the dressing. A shout out goes to the bread, because it was truly amazing. As such, I am a little torn here with my rating and will knock off one point. 

The place is tiny but with a cute decor. However, the compact place also means a lot of traffic from the service staff. As there is no loop through the dining area, there is no way for the staff to move graciously between the tables. This means often staff leaving some guests unattended. My biggest complaint was in regard to the front of house timing. Someone would bring out a plate from the kitchen. It would be placed on a cart for inspection. It often would sit there alone, unattended, until the right server would spot it, pick it up and deliver it. Pretty poor communication if you ask me. Even worse, more than once was I sitting dry with food on the plate and no wine in the glass. The wine and food timing was completely off. 

Other small mistakes, such as not adjusting my napkin after I excused myself for the wash room, a slice of bread that was put on my plate and then taken back to the tray after I declined on more bread, and the fact that my coat could not be found are mistakes that should never happen in a 3-star place. It is clear to me that the chef lives in his kitchen, but front of house are running around without clear marching orders or supervision. For this I am knocking off another point. 

If you love food and amazing flavors and can look beyond some of the front of house faux pas, then by all means do not skip L'Arpege. But if you are a stickler expecting crazy dishes that wow you visually it is best you stay away.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/40/37/57/caption.jpg

Recently, my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to dine at the renowned three Michelin star restaurant, Arpège in Paris. As vegetarian on that day, we were excited to explore the vegetarian-friendly options this establishment had to offer. However, our experience fell short of our expectations due to various factors that left us feeling dissatisfied and overcharged.

Unwelcoming Start:

Upon our arrival, we found the restaurant door closed, After peering inside, we noticed someone standing there, seemingly aware of our presence. To our surprise, the lady asked us to return 30 minutes later as the restaurant was ""not ready"" , leaving us feeling unwelcome. 

The Price Shock:

While waiting, we decided to pass the time at a nearby café. Curiosity led us to browse the restaurant's website, where we discovered the exorbitant prices associated with each dish, particularly the set menu. The steep cost gave us pause and ultimately led us to contemplate canceling our reservation. Unfortunately, we discovered that the cancellation fee was a staggering 1000 Euros, leaving us feeling trapped.

Underwhelming Main Course:

Once seated and served, we found that the complimentary appetizers were the highlight of our meal. However, I was disappointed by the limited options for vegetarian main courses. The sole vegetarian dish I chose resembled the complimentary raw vegetable platter we had, albeit cooked and caramelized. Regrettably, it tasted more like a warm dessert rather than a satisfying savory main course. It was disheartening to leave my main dish unfinished, especially considering the hefty price tag of 155 Euros for a plate consisting of only ten small pieces of steamed vegetables. This is not the first time I had vegetarian dishes at 1 to 3 Michelin Star world wide. 

Lackluster Dessert Experience:

Despite expressing our fullness to the server, we were persuaded to order two kinds of desserts to share. We requested half-sized portions, but even then, we were unable to finish a single dessert. The unappetizing experience with the desserts further contributed to our overall dissatisfaction. In an attempt to minimize waste, we decided to take the complimentary desserts with us and later gifted them to a homeless woman with a beautiful dog the following day.

Unpleasant Surprise:

As we were preparing to leave, to our astonishment, our table server opened a new bottle of water without seeking our consent. The additional charge for the unrequested water was an unwelcome surprise, further adding to our growing disappointment.

Conclusion:

Our experience at Arpège, though highly anticipated, turned out to be a letdown.

I had left the Rodin Museum today, my first day out in Paris after recovering from flu.  I was searching for a restaurant and entered Arlene, asking if they had a table for myself.  the greeter was smiling, friendly, and welcoming!  I was seated with Simon, the waiter, and he and the kitchen went above and beyond....the food was PURE ART and the taste of the many dishes was PURE HEAVEN!!!!  I knew I was in a rarefied culinary world when ordering herbal tea, they wheeled in pots full of gorgeous herbs for me to select.  my main plate was scallops encased in bay leaves with a lobster sauce.  I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant.  and, being a 3 star Michelin restaurant, they are so relaxed and pleasant, even while being attentive.  every time I think of my lunch today, a warm, cozy smile shines from my heart. :)","1","","SOLO","2024-02-29","2024-02-07","2024-02-07","en","L'Arpege","718128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r937347196-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 1","L'Arpege: Don't waste an evening in Paris here","My husband and I dined at Arpege on 26th Jan to celebrate my 50th birthday. Unfortunately, the diner is memorable for its utter mediocrity.  I was reluctant to try L'Arpege given its mixed reviews and should have followed my instinct. We dined at the one star Qui Plume la Lune the previous night and it was superb. I don't normally write reviews but would like to prevent others – especially vegetarians –  from bothering with this tired lazy restaurant. I have been a vegetarian for 38 years and dined in many 3 star, 2 star and 1 star restaurants throughout the world so feel qualified to judge L'Arpege. The service was unfocused and casual to the point of sloppy (wine glasses were uncleared, service was not attentive etc.) The menu was what one might expect from a farm restaurant in that the produce was good quality but sloppy in presentation and not remotely creative in combination of flavours.The vegetarian selection of dishes (there is no vegetarian set menu option any more) did not cohere  together. The chef seems to expect diners to be impressed by his egg starter that he's been serving for nearly 30 years. Haute vegetarian dining has moved on. Diners should too.","3","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-01-30","2024-01-30","en","L'Arpege","718128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r936120759-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 5","The real 3-star; simply.","Extremely creative cuisine. As expected for a proper 3-stars, you get transported in a unique world, in the chef's vision. For many things, you can't tell if it's good or if it's bad, simply because this is something you've never experienced nor tasted before. You just drop a tear and you ask for more.

The servings are very generous and even for a large eater like me, finishing the meal was becoming a challenge.

The service is extremely classy and professional, as well as the attire of the servers.
As expected, the wine list is telescopic and only the help of the sommelier can properly guide you through the best pairing.

We will point the attention brought to single travelers who are greeted with a comic book explaining the chef's vision, work and the dishes. That makes time fly.

The imitation of the classic ""sauce beurre blanc"" (white butter sauce) is extraordinary. I only experienced such experiment in another 3-stars.

Overall, all aspects of the French cuisine are here and mastered: vegetables, plants, meat, fish, traditional, modern, creative, etc… and all is well executed. No molecular cuisine or nitrogen artefacts here. In fact, what surprises the most is that the dishes seem so simple and the list of ingredients seem so short that you feel you could do it yourself; only until you taste what is presented to you. Another thing that surprises is that ingredients that seem not to go together are married, and the result is out of this world. 

The lower room I was in is decorated with real flowers put on a wall looking like a painting canvass. Never seen before and you can spend long minutes looking at it in details.

You clearly are in the world of an artist who's very dedicated. For example, one of the components of one of the starters is turnip. The chef has experimented the same turnip seed, planted at the same time in 3 of his gardens disseminated across this part of France, and then found out that the end-result will give 3 different products. Based on that he will choose what seems to be the best for him.

The old-time hot-cold egg is a wonder of creativity and craftsmanship by the mastery of required technicality for the cooking, and perfect timing for the serving; indeed, if you wait too long for eating it, the surprising hot-cold effect is no longer there.

If there is one small negative thing to mention: be warned that you have to park yourself. No valet, no dedicated parking.","0","","SOLO","2023-12-31","2024-01-18","2024-01-18","en","L'Arpege","718128","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r934576453-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Atmosphere: 3","Un dejeuner a l'Arpege","I would recommend the restaurant for its food. I came to the Arpege to taste the vegetables of Alain Passard, and I am not disappointed.  

- The plate of amuse-bouche made of slide root vegetables and little shells was simple but well presented. The taste was on point.
- The classic Arpege egg was delicious as expected.
- Another classic: the vegetable dumplings were superb. The broth was especially excellent with notes of celery.
- the ""sushi"" with kalamata olives was well balanced and well executed. I appreciate that the chef took into consideration my dislike for cheese and provided this dish instead.
- the squash soup with the sage whipped cream was excellent. The texture was silky smooth and buttery. I would have liked nice quenelle of cream rather than a rustic looking scoop.
- the leek and pear with a very interesting dish. The associate worked perfectly. The note of pepper on top were what needed to elevate this dish. The leeks provided some welcome mache.
- The quenelle of scallop and truffle was a surprise since I was expecting only vegetable. It was delicious nonetheless. The parsnip? and truffle cream was again silky smooth and the crunch of the fresh truffles balanced this very well.
- The beet tartare, another classic was on point and the mustard carrot condiment worked so well with it. A great dish.
- the final savory dish was my least favorite of all. While I was impressed by the cooking of each winter vegetable, the sweet and sour sauce was not to my liking. The buttery taste was too overpowering for me.
- the hazelnut souffle was great. A great balanced of nutty and smooth chocolate flavors.
- another classic, sweet this time. the flower apple tarte. Great touch of tartness here and there and nice puff pastry. The caramel was unexpectedly sour. 
- the plate of migniardises was well assorted. The vanilla whisky macarons will be remembered.

The small size of the room and the large and necessary numbers of staff make the dining room feel cramped and crowded at all time. The constant back and forth of the staff (again necessary) made us difficult for us to stay focused on the food and conversation. Would we have been seated at the different table (other than the little square table behind the entrance) it might have been different. This will be difficult to improve because it is due to the size of the dining room.

The staff was professional and understanding at all time. However, service is the area that could use some improvements.
- I made a 12pm reservation but the door was closed at noon and opened 4-5 min later.
- The waitress who greeted us at our table had a stained on her jacket lapel. That should not happen at the beginning of a service.
- We chose the vegetable lunch menu. We explained that we were not ""heavy"" drinkers and that we would go with wine by the glass. Since we did not know what we will be eating, we asked for recommendations and the answer we got was that people usually go with white. We were a bit surprised back the lack of depth of the answer.
- The choice given for aperitif was not large. Since we declined champagne (because we do not like bubbly wine and I will come back to that) we were provided with only one option: a glass of chardonnay. We decided to give it a little bit of thought. Once my spouse returned from the restrooms, the waitress asked us if we were ready for our glass of wine. It felt that we did not have other choice than to accept it. That was a bit pushy
- We appreciate that one of our waiters asked about the pace of the meal we would like to adopt. We gladly enjoy the little wait between dishes. The overall experience lasted for four hours and did not feel like it. It was well paced.
- My wife being American, the staff talked to us in English. Hearing the descriptions of the dishes and other interactions with customers, I found out that we missed on numerous details. Should we come back, we will ask for the French version and I will translate for my wife.
- Coming back to the champagne, when the bill was given to us, I noticed that a glass of champagne was mistakenly charged instead of an aperitif wine. While we appreciate the commercial gesture of offering us the water, we should be able to trust such establishment to get the bill right without having to check it. However, I am glad I did.

The menu was reasonably priced with outstanding produce and impeccable attention to detail. The extra like coffee and water were quite expensive. The pours of wine or digestives could be a bit more generous. I went to similar establishments outside Paris, where generosity was of primary importance. Unfortunately, it seems that it is a trait of province and not Paris.

This was a memorable lunch from start to finish. We opted for the surprise lunch menu of 11 dishes and added a main - we had the Dover sole and the sweetbreads. We spent over 3 hours being entertained with one dish after the other of utter delight and deliciousness. All the plates were full of flavor, pieces of art and an ode to vegetables. We also had several iconic dishes such as the egg which has been on the menu for 37 years! How can an egg be so tasty?? We also had the beetroot tatare with its condiments. And since tomatoes and lovage are in season, the gaspacho, minestrone (with eel) and the sushi exposed the elegance of this fruit. The highlight of the dessert was the chocolate millefeuille. In 60 years I have never seen this baked to perfection. It was sublime. A gastronomic delight. Everything was served with a lot of elegance - the staff balanced professionalism with a sweet human touch. The sommelier was such an expert (lots of natural wines) who catered to our desires. The finale was a beautiful plate of sweets and tarts that we asked to take home. The whole experience was remarkable. And yes maybe the restaurant is small but it felt very intimate. The sounds from the kitchen audible as the doors opened but this also made the experience genuine. Yes it is expensive but for a 3 star Parisian restaurant of this calibre a lunch menu for 185 € is really a great deal (eleven dishes!). Thank you Alain Passard for giving vegetables a royal treatment and for tantalizing our palates with amazing French produce.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/25/ac/e7/caption.jpg

Food: 2","Go elsewhere if looking for fine vegetarian cuisine, welcoming staff and competent management of allergy requirements.","Arriving on a drizzly Parisian winter's evening 5 minutes before my reservation time, I found the door locked. A staff member looked blanky through the window before finally opening the door. Having advised them I had a reservation they then indicated they were not yet open and left me on the street until 731pm. An appalling initial impression, noting this is not a hotel restaurant with a pleasant foyer to wait. 

If I knew what was to come, I would have just left. 

The decor is pleasant. The dining room felt quite crowded, with the table being located next to the busy kitchen and its squeaky door. Dietary and allergy requirements provided at the time of booking were forgotten. Whilst the majority of dinners were English speaking, the menu is still not available in English. And most disappointingly for this once renowned vegetarian restaurant is that the menu no longer even has a vegetarian selection.

Having opted for the 5-course, the waiter initially continued a 'hard sell' for the 12-course before just proceeding to outline his favourite dishes that could be adapted as vegetarian. On enquiring on a degustation, the Sommelier just thrust a menu and advised they don't offer one. I requested 3 wines by the glass to match the 5 courses.

The recommended wines were ok, but the supposed Sommelier's abilities were poor. Having recommended a wine, it arrived with the very limited introduction of ""this is a Sauvignon Blanc"" before just walking off - there was a little improvement over time but not much.

In terms of the food:
- No butter or olive oil was provided with the bread.
- The amuse bouche was nice, but being advised to stir it would have made the difference.
- The first course of dumplings was very tasty.
- The second course of onion gratin with truffle smelled good but was effectively a plate of onion with shaved truffle and greenery atop.
- The third course of beet tartar was very nice.
- The fourth course of leek and truffle was, similar to the onion, a plate of leek just hidden under some truffle.
- The fifth course was a plate of favourless vegetables in a sauce. 

The 'cheese board' was a block of Comte. Bizarrely for a tasting course, all courses were savoury - with dessert then being an additional cost. Dessert options then proposed included those I was allergic too.

Service was poor. There are lots of staff, yet most plates went uncleared for some time. I failed to finish multiple dishes yet only on the last did the waiter enquire. Upon asking for the bill, the waiter advised the fifth course would be deducted.

Most definitely not recommended. I visit Paris a couple of times a year and I will not be back to Arpege.

Downstairs is litterally the basement with no window so very claustrophobic. We were initially downstairs but we asked for a table upstairs and fortunately we managed to get one. Already better but the place is so small that we ended up being not far to the kitchen door, which is obviously disruptive. In terms of service, except for the somelier, everybody was extraordinarily snooty. The female maitre d' is was a caricature of what American tourists dread in Paris. The food is certainly sophisticated, almost excessively, with too much emphasis on style and not enough on substance. In summary, a disappointing, if not painful, experience, obviously made worse by the overpiced bill. Avoid.
