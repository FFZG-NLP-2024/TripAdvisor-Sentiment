The food was good, but considering the Michelin level, we expected a bit more, particularly with the salad and the overall finesse of the dishes. That said, our waiter was wonderful, and he kindly offered for us to finish our bottle of wine on the terrace, which was absolutely stunning.

We opted for the à la carte menu, so we can't speak to the tasting menu—perhaps we'll give that a try next time. Overall, we feel the restaurant has potential, and we'll give it some time to further develop.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/6b/ac/42/caption.jpg

We had the tasting menu with wine pairings and everything from the moment we arrived until we left was first rate.   Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation and the service was impeccable.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  The view from any corner of the restaurant equally pleasant (although I'm sure the cathedral view is the most coveted).  The atmosphere is contemporary, clean and open.  We had a table in front of the kitchen.  What an impressive operation.  I can't understand the negative reviews.  They reflect completely different experiences.  The tasting menu was somewhat of a splurge but definitely good value for the money.  Would absolutely do it again and recommend to other foodies.","0","","FAMILY","2024-05-31","2024-05-23","2024-05-23","en","Horto","24960819","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187849-d24960819-r952066497-Horto-Milan_Lombardy.html"

changed place of work and wnet there.

We did know Antonio since 1992, so going there is a must.

The place is very attractive, in the center of milan (250 mt from La Scala)
and on 6th floor, so in its terrace You can see all the roofs of center of Milan
and spires of Duomo.

We took one first and on 2nd course, each.
Quality seems good, and presentation is nice.
A good selection of complementary appetizers from the chef was served, too.

I honestly will go for typical (old times cheap) meat, so
""animelle"" (Sweetbreads toast) and ""lingua"" (Milanese style calf tongue).

Wine selection is good, but we will return to explore better.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/c3/2c/4d/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Carless neglect and disappointment ","We were very hopeful upon seeing the dining room and roof deck and the space was light, open, sensual and inviting. Next, the show stopper was the amuse-bouche, which offered a delightful and exotic trip for the palette. 
Unfortunately, this inspiring beginning was the best part of the night for us. 

The head waiter was unwelcoming and hurried and no other person in the restaurant engaged with our table. For a place that rests it's entire philosophy on time and slowness, our dinner could not have been more of the antithesis. 

After traveling throughout Italy and Switzerland and visiting some of the best restaurants, each experience we had prior to Horto was some of the most stunning displays of hospitality and culinary excellence.  In our other restaurants experiences throughout Europe both sommeliers and servers took their time and demonstrated pride in offering us creative narrative, ingredient explanations, and notes and history of the wine. We experienced none of this care, enthusiasm, or passion at Horto. For a very expensive check we paid for the bare minimum without any of the hospitality one expects from a Michelin rated restaurant.  

Additionally, a storm came during our dinner and while I understand that this is a change of course for the restaurant, it was as if it was their first time encountering this event. One would hope that the weather is a well-ironed aspect of how the establishment plans their operation given the roof. We ended up waiting sometimes 30 minutes between courses and our evening ended up starting at an 8pm seating, and ending at 12 midnight. We found several of the courses to be bland, unseasoned, and in some cases inedible. 

It was a disappointment to end our trip this way. If you are looking for a fantastic culinary experience in Milan, visit Felix Lo Basso's restaurant. You will not be disappointed.

The food was quite tasty, but not exceptional and in our opinion not qualitatively comparable to other star restaurants we have been to, but the service was downright mediocre. Therefore the low review. There were two of us. Allergy from one person passed on in advance, but was not asked which of the two. Meat cleaver gehannes put with fish dish and vague wine advice. After forty-five minutes when most of the other tables had started earlier, the music went out and there were hardly any staff. Refilling water was not done and whether we still wanted wine was not asked. Dessert was served without drink advice while all glasses were empty. Therefore I asked for a sparkling wine myself that we had also received at the start, but we were recommended another wine that was put on the bill for € 35 per glass without further explanation. At the end, we felt a little robbed. A lunch for two people for € 385 with a very mediocre service. You don't have to think about what the service would be like if we had booked another half hour later.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-14","2024-09-14","en","Horto","24960819","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187849-d24960819-r969705113-Horto-Milan_Lombardy.html"

The location is gorgeous. everything was very well looked after, wonderful recycled wood floors, walls with a particular finish, a truly refined environment. Stunning view over the city of Milan, with the gallery and cathedral in the foreground.
We had an à la carte lunch to celebrate a birthday. Each dish was surprising, the idea of serving the risottos with the copper pot on the table was very beautiful, to make a second or third party or to let other diners taste it.
The dishes were all fantastic, but particularly noteworthy were the risotto with chicory, the BBQ pork with cabbage, the toast with sweetbreads.
Prices more than reasonable for a starred hotel.","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-03-12","2024-03-12","en","Horto","24960819","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187849-d24960819-r941952510-Horto-Milan_Lombardy.html"

The environment is modern with a small view of the spiers of the cathedral. There is also a large outdoor terrace that can be used in summer.
We chose one of the tasting menus, although there is also the possibility of ordinary à la carte.
The dishes were very good and aesthetically very beautiful. We admit that we didn't dare too much by choosing the ""simplest"" menu among the ones offered.
Perhaps a cuisine that did not fully match our tastes, but we still recognize great quality in the dishes served.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/81/ae/37/caption.jpg

The service was not as great as I expected it took a long time from when we sat down to when we started eating. 8 course menu and a bottle of Champagne: I was sufficiently satisfied but the spark didn't strike. Good but not ""magical"" dishes, the risotto is what I appreciated the most. Negative note, the noise: the location is fantastic, it overlooks the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele but the noise echoes in the restaurant and it feels like being in a pizzeria (without taking anything away). I think the windows affect this aspect. The bill is in line with a starred restaurant, but if I had to choose I wouldn't return.","0","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-23","2024-02-22","en","Horto","24960819","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187849-d24960819-r939454819-Horto-Milan_Lombardy.html"
