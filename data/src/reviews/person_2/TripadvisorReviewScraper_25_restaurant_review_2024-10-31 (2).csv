The wine pairings were interesting and allowed us to discover many new wines and regions of Spain.

The plates are all carefully presented and the ingredients are superb. The staff was all very welcoming and passionate about the food and wine, making you feel at home. Highly recommend for a Michelin experience!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/09/df/29/lluerna.jpg

The 'new' Lluerna is spacious, modern and offers a nice view into the kitchen. The tasting menu offers a fabulous range of dishes and the wine list offers enough interesting choices by the glass. The suggested wine pairings were solid. We enjoyed every single dish, but special accolades go to the solid mojito, the lamb shoulder and the ecologic tomatoes with marinated bonito.

When you enter into the restaurant first of all you can see a big wood door and a maître that is waiting for you and attends you like a V.I.P. The decoration it’s impeccable and you can see how the cook are cooking all the service, it’s too impressive. The staffs are very professional and elegant. We ordered a presentation menu that was compound for 13 dishes and every bite was and spectacle. I don’t have words to describe this sensation or feel.

They have a Michelin star, and you can see why. The typical parade of delicate, exquisite dishes.
Service was excellent and the restaurant very attractive inside.
But somehow they seem un pretentious, with friendly staff from the boss down, and the chef dropped by each table at the end of the meal.

We came away satisfied and not hungry (which is not always the case in these restaurants)

The list of dishes was too long to remember an recite, but the fish was delicious, as was the tomato dish, however my favourite was probably the white aubergine.

All delicious, and thoroughly recommended!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/c4/71/b3/lovely-food.jpg

A very special one. The service was perfect and the food was just as good. 

We opted for the tasting menu (and added a cheese course as well). Each course was delicious and more interesting than the next, with a personal favourite of mine being a take on beef wellington with celeriac (see photos). There was also a very detailed description of each course.

The restaurant is located in santa Coloma, and you wouldn’t necessarily know it’s there (or so good) unless you knew. It’s worth taking the metro to have a try. The bill came to around 200 EUR including wine, really reasonable for what it was. 

The atmosphere is calm and relaxed, not in any way stuffy as I expected it to be to be honest. We felt welcome and didn’t feel we were being forced out the door (even if we were the last to leave). Overall, we spent a very special 3 hours in lluernas and I look forward to doing it again soon!

There’s also a tapas bar next door (same owners) which I’ll be paying a visit to very soon!

The atmosphere was so romantic. There were few persons at the restaurant and the waiters were close and professionals. We decided to take the “menú degustación”. We wished to eat the typical dishes of the restaurant. We ate several kinds of food. 
All was amazing ad delicious!

The waiter explained us each one of the dishes, how eat was made, the ingredients and the best way of enjoying the meal. Even he put a birthday candle in my dessert and then all the people in the restaurant sang happy birthday song.

For me all was positive and I strongly recommend to go there and enjoy this place.
For sure I’ll come back again.

","Make a reservation early to secure your table, lest you get disappointed if you are a walk-in customer as the seatings are limited and most who came by made reservations. We came when they opened at 9pm while the rest streamed in around 10+pm. 

Degustation menu is available from Tuesday to Thursday. It's really value for money priced at $30+ euros! Had a total of 10 items (including bread) which kept me very full and satisfied!
Service was prompt and good and at the beginning we were told if we wanted to knew what was being served or just let every dish be a surprise. We chose the latter and had an enjoyable time. The waitress, at times couldn't find the English words to introduce the dishes but we are happy still, to let our taste buds do the work. 

The first dish was ""mojito solids"" which was a refreshing change to the usual amuse bouche. 

The second dish was the most memorable for me. Cod fish foam with honey. Something unique from the usual.
