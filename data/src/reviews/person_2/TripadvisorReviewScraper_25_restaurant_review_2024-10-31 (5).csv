Atmosphere: 5","Word's Best Vegan Restaurant","The service here was exceptional. Everyone who greeted me here seemed to remember my special requests and acted as if they genuinely cared. This more of an experience than a place to eat food at. The food itself was special. Most vegan places give you cliche cashew butters and mushroom steaks. However, this place was special and gave unusual ingredients you rarely see anywhere else, such as Chinese mahogany. This is a once in a lifetime place and no ordinary restaurant at all.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-08-31","2024-08-31","en","De Nieuwe Winkel","2430614","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r967689057-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Had an absolutely delightful dining experience at De Nieuwe Winkel in Nijmegen!","Despite playfully poking fun at the traditional Dutch eating habits, my dining experience over the past year has been nothing short of extraordinary. When my husband mentioned that De Nieuwe Winkel in Nijmegen was crowned the Best Vegetable Restaurant in the World two years in a row by We're Smart, I knew that I had to experience it for myself.
We took a spontaneous detour, canceling our reservation at L'Arpège in Paris for our anniversary dinner to savor the flavors of Chef Emile van der Staak's Botanical Gastronomy. Tucked away in the former Catholic orphanage of Nijmegen, finding this hidden gem added an extra layer of adventure to our evening.
Chef Emile's dedication to showcasing the best of Dutch ingredients amazed us. Nearly everything sourced locally, from Food Forest Ketelbroek to Ommuurde Tuin, Bodemzicht, and even green tea from Brabant. It's a true celebration of eating local taken to the next level.
In Chef Emile's words, ""Once nature has done its work, it is our turn. We pick. Smell. Taste. Analyze. Ferment. Cook. Until there is something on your plate that amazes and overwhelms you.""
Our enthusiasm for tasting the custom-made botanical drink pairings led to an exclusive tour of their lab. Witnessing the craftsmanship behind the scenes, from cheese to tempe, nukazuke, and all the botanical drinks, was an eye-opening experience.
De Nieuwe Winkel is not just a restaurant; it's a culinary sanctuary where nature's bounty is transformed into art on your plate.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/41/21/7a/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 4","Not interested in clients' opinions","Let's start with the positive: the food is innovative and brings you a complete new range of flavours. And the service in general is on spot, yet informal. 
Now the flipside: I did not like certain dishes, which can happen. But no one asks how the dish was when they clear it, and when I told them that I did not like a dish, the only question was 'Shall I then clear it?'
I would have expected that if you don't like two or three dishes (and they are all a surprise for you) that you offer an alternative. Or at least a free coffee at the end. But nothing.
When I raised this to the chef/owner, he told me that this did not fit in his cooking process and that he actually was not interested in his clients' feedback on the dishes. Which I find really odd for a 2-Michelin star restaurant with these prices. I told him I felt dissatisfied with my restaurant visit and he let me go. 'Have a pleasant life!' one of his staff shouted at me.","0","","FAMILY","2023-10-31","2023-10-07","2023-10-07","en","De Nieuwe Winkel","2430614","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r920159094-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html"

Food: 3","Unique, surprising but also disappointing","We went to De Nieuwe Winkel in December with a party of 4. We opted for the 9-course menu and added an extra ""cheese platter"" dish. All of the dishes, even for well-seasoned vegans, were surprising in that many were unrecognisable with unique appearances and tastes. The sunflower butter and accompanying crackers, for example, were delicious. The use of unusual ingredients such as a local lemongrass and Kliswortel is admirable.  However, several dishes were also disappointing: the coiled cabbage (with silky tofu) and the (undercooked?) leek (in the superb Spirulina algae broth) were stringy and tough to break down; the ""chocolate"" desert was very oily; and the vegan cheese dish wrapped in vine leaves was rather distasteful; and the “risotto” was too rich. The wine pairing was OK (the smoked white wine is perhaps an acquired taste) and the non-alcohol version is to be recommended with unusual tastes. The service is very extravagant with waiters calling out dishes in unison and a bit over the top obsequiousness. Although we enjoyed the experience, I left without feeling inspired and will not readily return.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/b8/ee/a6/super-yummy-crisps.jpg

Food: 5","Unique in The  Netherlands  a Vegan two stars","Really unique a vegan Michelin two stars restaurant. One drawback: fully booked and again fully booked so book firmly two months or more in advance. But then you will enjoy super fine, clean, bio, wild, creatively prepared, steamed, roasted, fermented, extracted, squeezed, mandolinized, and what have you, dishes you never tasted before. Wines and beers: same. 
But as there is no price list for the drinks, no written indication of what there is (and be sure: a great abundancy there is) you could be tempted to ask for a price indication. Do. It is OK, not exaggerated. With the menu there comes a standard water service, bubble and still, for 7 € unlimited refill per 2 menus, at least that I extracted from the bill. A six course dinner, amuse bouche and bread comes to € 100.- Be surprised also of the drinks, alcoholic and home prepared astonishing non-alcohol drinks. 
Super staff, great knowledge. No posh surrounding, no posh people.","1","

Food: 5","Unbelievable","I can't believe that I'm writing this review. 

I am a prime rib and Bordeaux sort of person who typically eats a limited range of vegetables. But, in these pandemic times, we have seen our (vegetarian) son twice in two years and wanted to have a treat. I was just hoping to survive it.

Truly blown away. The creativity, the combinations, the complexity of flavors, the knowledge and enthusiasm of everyone on staff. I have been to a reasonable number of Michelin star restaurants, but this one was extraordinary. As I told a friend, they have umami in buckets. I honestly had no idea you could create such rich, complex flavors without meat. The dark fermented garlic should be exhibit one.

I mentioned to the chef that I had no idea what you could achieve with fermentation and pan searing. He said that ""you have to build it up in layers: fermentation, searing, drying oven, vegetable bouillon...""

A special place. I recommend it.","4","","NONE","2021-08-31","2021-08-19","2021-08-19","en","De Nieuwe Winkel","2430614","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r804862027-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html"

Food: 2","Who are they kidding?","I know that this restaurant changes their menu regularly so maybe we were just unlucky when we ate there. But with what we ate, I just wonder: who are they kidding? We chose the 6-course surprise menu with wine pairing. We got 6 tiny courses, with barely anything to eat in each of them, from a tiny piece of pumpkin to a tiny piece of leek. Luckily the bread was nice otherwise I would have had to have an actual dinner when coming back home. Out of the 6 wines, 2 were some kind of beers that have nothing to do in this pairing. Tasteless, very sour and extremely disappointing.
The dessert was the cherry on the cake, although I wish there had been actual cake and cherry. Hay ice cream sandwich between two hay cookies. Maybe it's very original and unique but come on.
So, we paid 240 euros for 2 for a disappointing very light dinner. But hey, it's hype to be vegetarian, right? So why would they not enjoy charging customers so much to serve them the most basic ingredients (remember, hay!).
I don't give a 1-star rating because some of the dishes were tasty enough, but it definitely does not deserve more than 2.","2","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-10-24","2019-10-24","en","De Nieuwe Winkel","2430614","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r720977952-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html"

Bresse chicken marinated, so tender and more than delicious covered with strips of sauces.

It is a small cousy restaurant with trendy staff. We could choose between meet (chicken), fish or vegetarian menu.  Because we had some appetite we choose the 6 courses menu with fish. You get something different comparing to other fancy places. We choose fish, so you expect some fish. One of the starters had a bit of fish in it and that was it. The main course was a tasty piece of a carrot (but then purple) and the second main course some beet. Loved the dessert most. A tasty appel and a nice vegie cheesecake variation.
We had a nice evening, but at the end we had to laugh about it.  If we would go here with our parents they would call us crazy. 160 euro for a petit carrot and beet as main-course. Ridiculous.  So if you are a vegetarian and you want something tasty this is the place, but you pay a lot for it. If you want a nice piece of fish or meat better go to another place.

The setting is minimalistic , rather sober and casual , a little sub ..  . The service is prompt , the staff  warm , friendly and ready to explain or providing a helping comment where decrypting the dishes sometimes is necessary . And they evidently enjoy this in a slightly teasing , but overall professional way . The level of team spirit is to be admired .   
Behind the name  ""A new store""  a deliciously wonderful and creative approach is  used by the young chef and his equipe , to transform classic grocery ingredients to a fantastic delicatessen level .  Respect for biological protective principles and fresh quality  is outstanding .  It confirms the hand of a promising master , passionately weaving new techniques and associations around  old standards with surprising flavours and freshness . 
At the end not the cheapest of bills ( 92 € - 5 courses & associated wines/juices/beer ), but this type of commitment and work deserves a merit .  
Absolutely recommended for serious taste trippers  .","0","","NONE","2016-10-31","2016-10-27","2016-10-27","en","De Nieuwe Winkel","2430614","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r432255091-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html"
