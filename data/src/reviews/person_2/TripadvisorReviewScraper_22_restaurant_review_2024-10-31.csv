It’sa while we wanted to visit Il Piastrino and it was worth waiting.
Place is very cousy though minimal, the stone rooms combine very well aged rooms with modern items like iron lamps, mirrors...
Music is low and charming, service excellent from start to finish.
Disges presentation well done and dishes have very surprising ideas.
We irdered a “ radici”( roots) menu at only 55 euro each for a 6 course menu plus 3 welcome snacks that can count as proper dishes.
Wine list is very well done, i would add some slovenian wines more because its white wines are simply uniques.
We tasted an Istruan Malvasia by Fon( Vinogradi), 55 euro for a wine you can find at 30/35 by the producer so quite burgain.
We will come back, this is one of the place that impressed us the mist in the oast 2 years.
Very well done!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/70/52/33/photo0jpg.jpg

We took the (6 or was it 7 course?) Contemporaneo menu (€58) and were knocked out by the quality.
The bread only was already so good that we couldn't resist eating too much and had to leave a little of the main course, the delicious lamb.
The highlight was the thymus (Animelle), perfectly prepared, very soft, superb taste.
All over very subtle tastes, textures and wonderful presentation. Good and very friendly waiter and a pleasant serving speed. The restaurant definitely deserves its stella (star).
Wine book was incredible and our choice of 2008 Ronco del Re Sauvignon was perfectly fitting the menu.
The €165 we finally paid for the two of us would be double in The Netherlands for a Michelin star restaurant.
We will come back there the next time in Pennabilli, can't wait.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/dc/ef/63/photo0jpg.jpg

Claudia the wives owner hands you the menu answering any question you might have as Ivano the sommelier recommends the wine from an enormous list of options. Both very friendly and welcoming.
The food is excellent, a complete enjoyable experience, every time you get a bite you feel more and more amazed. Delicious!!
Everyone chose their plates except from my brother in law wich decided to order a fixed menu, perfect option!
By the end you ll feel satisfied but definitely have to try the desserts, soooo good! We ate them with a dessert wine, perfect combination.

Food goes with out saying. We ate well and enough, and this was probably on of the best meals we had this 2 week long trip to Italy.

Truffles, crepes with ricotta, parmasan, pigeon. Everything local. Well,  this menu for 55 euros, thats just to good to be true. If you find your self near Pennabilli, please take your time to visit Il Pianstrino.

The only negative I can say is that it was almost empty due to ""offseason"".

Excellent food. The Michelin guide's description is perfect:  “The dishes, beautiful for the eyes and exquisite for the palate, are complex and elaborate, but never unnecessarily artificial.” I noted only one flaw, which was also annoying: the sommelier waiter. Unlike foods, it is ""unnecessarily artificial."" He expresses himself with a tone of voice that is not suited to the freshness of the place and the food, with a vocabulary that is completely out of place (""let's start playing with this wine...""). Added to this, unfortunately, is the quantity of drink needed for each glass, well below the 10cc which would be the minimum dose required by law. The timeliness of the service compared to the courses also left something to be desired. Considering the economic level of the place, this is no small flaw.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-27","2024-04-27","en","Il Piastrino","1769953","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1575031-d1769953-r948545150-Il_Piastrino-Pennabilli_Province_of_Rimini_Emilia_Romagna.html"

I found some of the entrees, the starter (Gratin of Jerusalem artichokes, cardoons, creamy egg, herring and black truffle), the pavlova and the pastries exquisite, I would say the starter was brilliant, but I didn't like the first course (Passatelli, juniper, mountain broth and preserved mushrooms), in which the broth (mix of bark, lichens and other) tasted too much of the forest and tended to cover the flavors and I found the second course (pork socket) good but ""normal"".

Excellent service from the staff. Excellent wine list. We tried the tasting menu which I recommend to everyone: very high quality local ingredients with some surprises from time to time, such as the use of red and black caviar and sturgeon. Excellent dishes and very well presented. Courtesy and competence complete the beautiful picture.","1","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-15","2023-10-15","en","Il Piastrino","1769953","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1575031-d1769953-r921393678-Il_Piastrino-Pennabilli_Province_of_Rimini_Emilia_Romagna.html"

I have some criticism regarding the dessert, or rather its desserts, because they were not to our liking, personally I would opt for simpler things so as not to have too strong tastes (personal opinion).
Excellent wines and excellent service, the girl was the most knowledgeable waitress I have met, my heartfelt compliments.
Regarding the aesthetics of the restaurant I must say that I wasn't crazy about it, the horrible floor and the colored carpets in poor taste, being a starred restaurant I expected more even in terms of where I could place my bag I would opt for a different object.
For everything else it was a very interesting experience!","0","","FAMILY","2023-10-31","2023-10-01","2023-10-01","en","Il Piastrino","1769953","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1575031-d1769953-r919357590-Il_Piastrino-Pennabilli_Province_of_Rimini_Emilia_Romagna.html"
