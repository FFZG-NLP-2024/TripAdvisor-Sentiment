Pizza was well composed but thick bready crust which was surprising.  Two pastas were leaden with heavy cheese and cream.  The one with guanciale  (like bacon) was not eaten.

The pancetta pasta was so salty I couldn't swallow it.  And the salami pasta so spicy it made me sweet.     Incredibly noisy and tell me Evan why do you have to charge 75 dollars for corkage.   Since you are sold out around the clock do you have to make 75 dollars pure profit to cork a bottle.     I think Evan is very busy with his other new stores and hasn't bothered to taste the food here in quite some time.

Arrived on time, well dressed, hostess seemed miserable and unfriendly. Was seated in worst tiny two top with horribly uncomfortable chairs next to the bar and under the loudspeaker playing obnoxious music.  But even worse there was a window into the office next to our table with someone doing paperwork with their desk right up against our table. I wasn’t sure if they were joining us for dinner or I was about to be asked to help with a spreadsheet.  On the window ledge was a stuffed rat, gave me the creeps, had other dusty trinkets.  What else do they not clean? Ordered a drinks, were served in champagne glasses, drinks were literally half foam. Steak good, potatoes salty, didn’t care for the pasta. Left with a headache!

I would go to the extent of saying that if you are visitng/living in the area around Venice beach and have time for just 1 meal, then this is the restaurnt to go to. Superb food and cocktails, but the surprise package was the Pizza. I almost never order a Pizza in a fine dining restaurant but I was tempted by what was being served on the next table and oh boy....it was simple the best Pizza I have ever had. It was so good that I am going to upload a photo for the first time.

Atmosphere: 4","Expect some attitude and fantastic pasta and pizza","A trendy restaurant, having earned its reputation over the years, and even though it's on the pricey side, we have been many times. The service on our arrival was immaculate as always. This time, however, the waiter had a tad too much school-teacher-esque attitude by our waiter celebrating himself and the fact that we could not receive our meals as ordered but they would bring them out ""family style"" whenever they had them ready. Please do not get me wrong: we loved the family style. The way it was presented to us: not so much. As I said: I've been a dozen or more times, never with a party of six though.

The six of us loved our entrées pizza and pasta (and when I say we loved we really really loved them) - however, our starters were rather meh - the BURRATA E PESCHE was not creamy at all and the POLIPO ALLA BRACE was more of a black bean salad with two small pieces of ""grilled octopus"" that was underwhelmingly ""un-crisp"" - we did not eat it, and no one cared. 

We will sure go again and hope they will do better next time. ","0","","FAMILY","2023-08-31","2023-08-05","2023-08-05","en","Felix","12417682","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r908019429-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html"

A very nice surprise discovered during our visit to Venice Beech. 

As a Belgian family we know how to appreciate Italian food. The pasta was al dente as it should be. 

The prices however were again extremely expensive.

I consider myself somewhat of a foodie. I’ve eaten in a lot of fancy restaurants in various cities around the globe in my 53 years on this planet.  However - I can honestly say that I’ve never eaten pasta like this (even in Italy). It’s the Texture! This is much more than a question of the correct al dente cooking time.  Something more is going on here. That aside, the accompanying sauce and ingredients were mouth wateringly delicious 😋 
I actually feel like I’ve just properly experienced great pasta for the very first time! 
We started our meal with a swordfish kebab. This was expertly cooked, succulent and very tasty. I could’ve eaten another plate, it was so good!
There was not a free table in the house. As soon as one group of diners left, they were quickly replaced by another lot. I’m not surprised. This place is a little gem just minutes away from Venice Beach. Great vibe, cool interior and great service. What a find on our trip to LA!

Service: 5
Food: 3","Not as good as before","I've been to Felix many times in the past few years and though it was one of the better Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. Unfortunately last night's visit was disappointing.
Perhaps things are different since COVID but the quality of the food was just not there. The stuffed squash blossoms are still a perfect appetizer, but I thought they were over-salted. The wonderful pizzas, from what I remember in the past, this time had a gooey-like consistency to the dough and also tasted soggy. Our pastas fared better though I thought the tagliatelle was overcooked and the orchiette dish is much better at Mozza.
I also think the new prices on the menu are very steep. $30+ for a pizza or pasta dish is just very steep.
Overall, the service was very good and the patio was a nice option for pleasant summer evening but the noise level was quite loud and it really wasn't necessary to also have the music on at the same time. It was difficult to hear my dinner colleagues across the table.
I've had some really wonderful meals at Felix in the past. Maybe it was a rough night in the kitchen, but I probably won't be back.","1","","NONE","2022-06-30","2022-06-26","2022-06-26","en","Felix","12417682","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r844746606-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html"

We had two salads and three pasta dishes to share. Note- for 3 people that was quite alot of food. Add the famous olive oil and herbed bread as a starter and you’ll be full for days. The service was great. The servers are all very well trained and recite the menu like pros. I must point out one exceptional staff member and that is Megan the bar manager/director. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine list, which is crazy extensive and expensive, but when you pay $32 for a bowl of pasta what’s a $74 bottle of excellent Pinot noir? My one slightly negative comment would be Felix’s rigidity. You must put in your entire order at once and they don’t do any substitutions. They also limit your dining time. My party of 3 had two hours to eat and drink and when we were over by about 20 minutes we were given our check and gently told there was another reservation waiting. Felix has become a Venice staple and if you want excellent pasta from an excellent chef, go and check it out.

This is an absolute must if you have a chance!!!

Ps- the service was a perfect balance of helpful, but non intrusive! Everyone went out of their way to answer questions we asked about the meal.

Heirloom Tomato Salad to start(sorry they call it something else) but wow. The tomatoes were amazing, the burrata cheese was fresh!

Had a Diovola pizza for appetizer-yum

Wife and I shared two pasta dishes.

I am from the region where the chef of Felix was trained at least on the home-making pasta. A friend of mine wanted me to try this one and here are my comments:
Ambiance: I didn’t see the inside as we had the reservation outside in the patio. The patio though was pretty basic (simple wood table and simple light bulbs across the ceiling). I don’t know if this was done in a hurry to accommodate customers while in the middle of the Covid crisis.
Food: we had 3 flutes of champagne, 3 appetizers (antipasti), 2 pizzas and 3 pastas (primi). The highlight were the Zucchini Ripieni, lightly fried almost tempura style. Then it went downhill pretty fast from there. The Polpette were salty (mortadella e parmigiano overpowering) and the fincione was more like a maritozzo romano (sweet) than a real fincione. What is the hype about this bread is beyond me. It shouldn’t be sweet. Appetizers didn’t arrive at the same time, my Polpette landed when the other antipasti were finished. Not good!
The pizzas arrived warm and the outside (cornicione) was chewy while the inside mushy. It sounded like rewarmed. Not good at all.
I Primi: i Rigatoni all’amatriciana were undercooked and I know what al-dente should be like. They are missing 2 minutes in the water. The rest, a Cacio e Pepe and the Pappardelle al Ragu’ pretty normal (Everybody knows how to cook Italian could do the same – read the Artusi book).
3 glass of wine at the price of gold, a Tiramisu too sweet and another desert that my wife had with an ice-cream uneventful (she didn’t finish it). I think it was a tart. Man oh man it was low.
The service: too many servers stepping on each other toes. We had probably 5-6 people working our table. Really!
The timing: you feel that the whole menu is built around fast and easy to make or pre-prepared dishes to get people out of the door within the allotted time and for the price they are asking it is just shameful.
Had I spent $120 for the whole meal it would have been a non-event, flat meal but still a nonevent, but for $600 hell no. I would have had no problem to spend that kind of money for an excellent quality meal but not for this. I can do way better myself at home and that was the most disappointing things. There was nothing special about this meal. Any trattoria in Emilia-Romagna and maybe a bunch of Italian restaurants in LA would do the same if not better for a fifth of the price. People giving 5 stars to this restaurant, I guess, either were eating Italian for the first time or they were there more for the hype of the restaurant and/or had money to waste.
Of course there is no point in going back.","2","","NONE","2021-08-31","2021-08-07","2021-08-07","en","Felix","12417682","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r802334185-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html"

This is a good spot for special occasions or a date night. They’re currently open during covid for outdoor dining on their patio; reservations can be made up to 7 days in advance, and for a party of four, are available in 2 hour increments. Cards are accepted, masks are required, and parking will suck because it’s in Venice, but you might get lucky and find a residential parking spot if you’re there early enough. 

Food wise, everything is delicious. The servers will recommend you get 6-8 dishes for a party of four, but I think those with lighter appetites could easily do with 4-5 dishes. The plates may look small, but the food is super filling. Here’s the lowdown on what we got:

Sfcionne: round bread baked with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh herbs. A lot of people on Yelp seemed to recommend it; glad I tried it for the first time, but it’s not necessary. 

Pizze Calabrese: there’s quite a few pizza options, and no one can ever say no. They cut the pizza into quarters and the dough was delicious. The ‘nduja was spicy and the cheese was slightly sweet. 

Tagliatelle: a must-get and one of the most popular pastas. The pasta was chewy and covered in a silky ragu - hands down the table’s favorite

Rigatoni: large and al dente, the guanciale seemed a bit clumped together but it was a solid pasta. 

Busiate: personally my second favorite; it had crushed almonds and I really enjoyed the fatness of the pasta. The cherry tomatoes were fresh and burst into bright flavors in your mouth. 

Orecchiette: good to get for meat lovers, as it comes with plenty of sausage. 

Budino: creamy and only slightly sweet - it’s comes with a cloud of whipped cream on top that’s almost like a marscapone cheese 

Overall, a really delicious meal - it’s easy to see why this is a super popular restaurant on the West Side. ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1c/4b/59/f6/photo0jpg.jpg

Food: 2","Italian Salt flats","Our group visits LA restaurants that are highlighted in critics reviews and articles.  Although we don’t always totally agree, mostly they are valuable and on the mark.  We were excited to try out Felix given its high ratings. Maybe this was an aberration but it was not at all impressive and in fact quite disappointing in many respects. We all at first gave it good, but I think it was because it was pricey and we hated to say otherwise as we would feel a little foolish.  But as the evening went on, each of us had some negative comments.  
     First, the food took awhile to come out and it did sporadically with our mains separated by 10 minutes or so, to a point where we encouraged each other to eat before it got cold.  A few orders were forgotten all together with apologies by the waitress. 
     Now to the food. The focaccia was warm, fragrant, chewy and delicious, although a little less olive oil on top would be better.  The zucchini blossoms were the highlight of the meal.  The meatballs were recommended but there were so salty to a point that   the meat was hard to taste.  My ragu bolognes was so salty that I could only eat half.  Again the pesto on my wife’s dish was lip puckering.  The porcini pasta dish was “ good” according to my friend and the other pastas were given very good marks.
      The desserts were again good but not memorable.  The other unusual aspect is they do not allow you to bring wine and when you review the extensive Italian wine list, you will be hard pressed to find any bottle under $100.  When checked with the Delectable app on my phone, the markup on their wines are around 3 times retail, again a little pricey.  Which leads me to my objection which is overall the prices are just very high.  You will find the average pasta dish is around $33 and although hand made.  We have been to many of the highly rated Italian restaurants in many cities and for the money as well as the food, I can not recommend dining here.  I feel badly saying that, but I do feel it’s justified at least with our experience tonight.  Again, maybe it was an aberration but I feel salt is put heavily on food to mask a weakness.","2","","NONE","2020-10-31","2020-10-29","2020-10-28","en","Felix","12417682","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r775908824-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html"
