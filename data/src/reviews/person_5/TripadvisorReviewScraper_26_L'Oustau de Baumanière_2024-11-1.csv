Atmosphere: 5","Experience.","Stayed at the hotel and ate at the 3*-restaurant as well at le Cabro. Paradise one earth, any picture you take from any angle is postal-card like! I wish I had bought that house decades ago! Great wine list. Quite a large change in the cuisine from my last visit 24 months ago. I would make a special mention to a ""Corinne"" (?), a young lady from Maurice who looked after my table at  le Cabro and was only smile and kindness. That’s what we want in restaurants: we do go to eat and taste cuisine, true but in the end, the floor is what makes a meal a moment when you simply ingest food however good it can be or a moment that becomes a key souvenir you remember all your life. There are 3 key reasons why one eats at a restaurant: 1- don’t want to cook. 2- don’t know how to cook (and master some special techniques etc…). 3- don’t have access to some special ingredients ( a 90-days aged meat, some exotic herbs for ex). That’s besides wishing to celebrate an event (but you could do that elsewhere).  Most people can’t see the difference between a Bourguignon lobster and a Thermidor beef so the warmth, the attentive staff, the smile on the face of each staff member is what makes the difference between even very high-end restaurants I have visited over the years. A mechanical service is the last thing you want, you know the one where a young staff will mechanically recite a prepared text and where most -young- staff will be too stressed  to make a mistake  and forget to smile?  The other special mention is to be able to interact with owner Jean-Andre Charial. Professionals of his calibre are now sadly rare in this industry, made me think of M. Depee (Pere) as well  from another great Maison a few years ago…Opened on Sunday evening which is great as not much choice elsewhere as we all know.","1","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-17","2024-09-17","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r970123576-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Perhaps if your seat isn't staring at hedges it is.  Unfortunately they have crammed far too many tables onto the terrace and therefore there are multiple poor views.  It really detracts from the ambiance and overall experience.   Instead of enjoying a peaceful view of alpilles we had to deal with our neighbour feeding his lamb supplement to his dog, listen to crying babies and watching patrons wearing t-shirts and chains vape.  The senior servers are professional, the junior ones with different uniform were amateur for a 3* in France.  I don't want to be upsold on sparkling water, either pick one producer for the restaurant or provide a menu.  I don't want to be scoffed at for only having two glasses of wine with my meal. 

The food, we had the local vegetable menu was excellent, particularly the carrot desert.  However, combined with the extremely poor reception at checkin to the hotel beforehand Baumanière got off to a terrible start with us and ruined what was supposed to beba treat at the end of our vacation

The setting itself deserves ten stars if I could give it that. Amazing ambiance with olive trees, gorgeous view of provincial topography , a very serene and calming setting. The food and the gimmicks were a bit disappointing. We did the 10 course tasting menu which was a lot of food. By the end I hated everything that came because I was very full. I would have preferred to have the option of five, seven and ten. The presentation of the food was truly interesting, very creative and very pretty, however I cannot say they  all tasted good. I think more effort was put into presentation versus taste. Again it is one of those three Michelin star restaurant that focuses more on presentation. The chef came and greeted us at the end which was a nice touch, however I recommend they take a look at their menu and tweak it. I still recommend you visit because it is an experience. I give it my GoldnAdvice seal of approval.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/ac/3a/56/caption.jpg

At that time, we did not expect that it could get any better but it has. While there are only three menus at lunch, each is a multi course delight. We chose the seven course menu and since we had the leg of lamb, it is only six courses. Each of the courses was a delight to vision and palate. We had after an appetizer of dots of flavor, two fish courses, one of squid and one of red mullet. I appreciated the freshness of both, though my wife was not as enthused. Then followed by lamb and two desserts. It is difficult to describe how perfect the day was, from beginning to end. This is a destination in itself and well worth the trip to experience such perfection.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-24","2024-06-24","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r956550234-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

We have had 3 stars Michelin experience in the past, mainly abroad and I have to say that we came back full filled by the expectation we had . First, the place is in a unique place (Baux de Provence is by itself one of the iconic landscape in France) and the restaurant offers a unique contexte like in a nest of the valley under the castle of Baux de Provence. The Terrasse outside when you eat is absolutely gorgeous. 2nd, the service is at the 3 stars Michelin level: perfect from a service point of view but on top of it, top notch on the hospitality part: real professional who knows how to « feel » the mood and style of the customer and adapt to it. Finally, about the diner, we chose the 10 courses « ballade » Menu which is typical from this type of restaurant : you don’t know what you eat till it the dish comes. It was always full of surprises , good ones, really challenging your mouth , taste and brain ! A real experience. As a note, we are far from the old cliché saying that french cuisine is big plate with nothing in it, though each dish is not a full plate, I guarantee  you don’t leave the 4 hours experience being hungry ! Definitely a place to try for amateur of top of the top fine cuisine","1","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-07-26","2023-07-26","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r905703120-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Purposely planned a stay at the hotel here this trip with the intention to dine again. Was very disappointed. Service was excellent, so no problems there. It was the food and menu. The choices were odd- a 10 course surprise, a several course vegetable only, and a leg of lamb with several prior dishes. We chose the lamb.  There was nothing that I enjoyed prior, and the lamb which finally came out at close to 11 pm was so-so. We actually contemplated leaving mid-way, a first ever, but figured we were already engaged so just went through with it. Sad to say , and definitely not worth the money and time. Cancelled dessert and left, feeling frustrated and disappointed.","1","","FRIENDS","2023-07-31","2023-07-03","2023-07-03","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r900102970-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

We were not disappointed with the food, what was disappointing was the change in tone. Whereas previously this had been a place of warmth, welcome and hospitality. In the old days they had a sort of sweet shop/candy store trolley to accompany coffee. Here we were given no choice but a tasting menu of 8 or 10 courses. We saw evidence that choice existed (a gigot bone) but were assured that eating a la carte was not possible. The food we had was exceptional but I would have loved a meal of 3 of the courses.

Food: 4","Something missing for a three-stars Michelin restaurant","Baumanière is a totally enchanting place, arriving there when the sun sets behind the cliff is a joy, being served by the nice and professional crew is a delight. At the end of the dinner, the chefs come and see you, which is always a pleasure.

So what was not up to my expectations? Basically the value for money of the meal. It was all extremely good products, perfectly cooked but so much ""expected"", with so little imagination or fantasy. Lobster, lamb and pigeon are not mandatory if they bore the cook and the client. The sardines with their heads, this was original and unexpected. The desserts are normally a dream of inventiveness, here they are stuck in their tradition. The signature desserts of the house are what, 40 years old? 

And tradition can kill a third star. It felt to me nearly the same I felt at Paul Bocuse just before it lost its third star, resting on its laurels, serving the same dishes as under President Giscard d'Estaing... I don't think the crêpe will live forever in my mind as Gilles Goujon's oeuf pourri à la truffe, as Bras's gargouillou de petits légumes, as Eric Fréchon's cannelonni. And this was my disappointment.

However, I'm sure the team has all the capacity to innovate, modernize and be a three-star restaurant worth of 2022. I'll keep an interested eye on the Oustau, wishing you all the best!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/40/72/9c/the-sardines.jpg

Our first was in 2018 when it was a 2-star restaurant and we would have been back sooner had it not been for COVID.  This time was to celebrate our 35th anniversary. 

I have often wondered what the difference was between a 2-star and 3-star and now I understand.  While the food was phenomenal both times, the service had clearly risen to a new level. I don’t understand how previous comments were so negative.  I don’t disbelieve them but it is certainly not the experience we had. We ordered the menu Ballade with the upper level of wine pairing so well over $500 euros per person. I can say that the experience was worth every penny.  

Dining in such a restaurant is something anyone who is a foodie owes themselves at least once in their lifetime. It is not just the food which was exceptional.  It is the overall experience. The service was like a well oiled machine. The staff was ultra attentive and courteous. The wine pairings were perfect and we had a chance to experience some incredible wines that we otherwise may have never discovered. 

If you are looking for a great meal with courteous staff, it is true you can get that in many France restaurants for much less  and we have done a lot of that each year when we spend a month in Provence.

But the experience of dining at l’Ostau de Beaumaniere based on our experience, elevates dining to a level that you may never again experience unless you frequent 3-star Michelin restaurants. We will definitely return.","0","","COUPLES","2022-05-31","2022-05-31","2022-05-31","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r840794732-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Food: 5","iconic restaurant","The Oustau de Baumanière is among the iconic restaurants in France and I was glad to see it recover its 3rd star in 2020 - deservedly so in spite of  the incomprehensible number of reviews suggesting otherwise. I had been there in 1977 (!) and recently returned for two consecutive dinners. We chose the Menu ""Ballade des Baux"" for the first evening - of the six courses, a starter of snails and garlic stood out, but the other dishes, except perhaps for the dessert, were excellent too. The second evening, we went à la carte - and the two starters of warm razor clams and roasted anchovies 'in sandwich style' as well as the pigeon and the Honey Millefeuille dessert were top. My wife and sister in law had the milk fed lamb and thought it as the best lamb they had ever eaten. This was served with an adaption of 'gratin dauphinois' which was probably a tad too heavy as a side dish - if there had been some suitable vegetables as a side, that might have been preferable. But this is nitpicking at a high level.
The wine list of the Oustau is outstanding - rarely will you find such depth of prestige Burgundies and Bordeaux - what includes Lafleur, Petrus, Domaine de la Romanée Conti. The pricing of these wines is intriguing - some vintages of Romanée Conti wines or Chateau Lafleur are way below their retail price.... which is why we had put two bottles of DRC Vosne Romanée Duvault-Blochet and Echézeaux reserved before our arrival.... and what a treat that was, with memories for a lifetime.","1","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-26","2021-10-26","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r816080949-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Avoid it.","1","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-14","2021-10-14","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r814449864-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Food: 2","This restaurant does not deserve a single star","The service was not only terrible but also VERY rude. The Gigot was cold, but not only that, the gratin dauphinois was also cold!! Can you imagine, in a three star Michelin restaurant? One had to look for the waiters and signal all the time to get their attention. They were never ready, even though there were too many running about. I complained to one of them about not having been served the water I requested and his answer, with a sardonic smile, ""c'est comme ça"". Unbelievable! Michelin: please review again if this place deserves 3 stars. I am convinced it should not have even one.","2","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-13","2021-10-13","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r814324918-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Food: 2","Total rip off","The trouble when one expects the best dinner ever, is that just a simple mistake turns the event into a total rip off. And since we experienced several mistakes, the whole night was awful. The waiter did not wear his face mask properly, and kept touching it all the time before setting silverware on the table or serving food. The legs of lamb were cold and full of fat. The potatoes au gratin were cold as well. In other words, we could have spent much less money and enjoy a better dinner elsewhere. Avoid the pretentious attitude. Not worth it.","1","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-11","2021-10-11","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r814069180-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Food: 5","Amazing cuisine and setting","We were in the region of Arles and decided to go for Lunch in L'Ousteau de Baumanière.  We had an amazing time (do not understand previous comments on the service which was top notch) with very creative food which surprized us in very good way. We took à la Carte starting with seashelf knife and sardines, then had lobster in two services and sweatbread. Dessert was also amazing as they made a sorbet in fronf of you with ice cube. We took a bottle of Domaine du Chevalier Pessac Leogan from 1975 which was perfect.
Hotel looks amazing with different houses and pools, so we will probably stay there next time, also the setting with surrounding rocks is impressive.","0","","NONE","2021-09-30","2021-09-22","2021-09-22","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r811283833-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Food: 3","Contempt Served, in Abundance, With Every Course","This was a bad choice that cost well over 1000 Euros; we would suggest you not make the same error. And we will suggest to Michelin that the mere idea of having different bread-items served with various courses is an insufficient reason to have awarded this place an additional star when it is run as poorly as it is--they should not include it on their well-respected list. My husband and I  decided to treat our hosts to the full dinner for our group of friends, believing from our experiences in the past at the same venue three years ago, and then three years before that (when we were guests at the hotel) that we would enjoy festive and memorable dining occasion. Boy, were we WRONG. While I don't speak speak French terribly well, I understand it, and the nasty little comments made about us by the servers--in passing and in undertones--we the kind of snarky remarks you'd expect from 19-year-old diner waiters in Queens--but at least the waiters in Queens would be funny and charming. These servers were simply nasty and judgmental (""This man here,"" said, one, referring to my spouse, ""Knows absolutely nothing about the wine and yet he keeps asking me questions. You talk to him""--a remark, by the way, that had nothing to do with a language barrier). The dishes were indeed inventive and intriguing, if not all equally complex or enjoyable, but the poor service cast an unmistakable shadow over our evening. When we left, I commented on my disappointment to a man I presume was the manager--I was paying the bill and he was overseeing the transaction--and he expressed a small moue of disappointment. He then gave me two little cakes in two little boxes; an odd offering given the number of guests. Let's just say it didn't leave any of us with a better taste in our mouths about the dinner.","1","","NONE","2021-09-30","2021-09-18","2021-09-18","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r810564886-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

The location is wonderful, but the service gets worse every day.  There are exceptions, workers who have been there for years and try to make up for the shortcomings of the new ones.  For example, the maitre of the restaurant is magnificent, as are the older waiters and especially those who collect your suitcases and make transfers between the reception and the hotel, they are the best of the hotel.

The great loss has been the sommelier's retirement (Gilles Ozzello).His substitute I do not know if he was busy or hiding during our stay but he never attended us and those who did broke all the corks of the bottles ...
The hotel has a magnificent wine cellar.

The waiters have a lot to learn from the maitre and what quality standards are in a Michelin star restaurant and in a Relais & Châteax hotel.

The Oustau de Baumaniere has the location, the restaurant, the wine cellar , but the young waiters fail .

Forgetting these deficiencies in service, the hotel has something magical","0","","COUPLES","2021-07-31","2021-08-29","2021-08-28","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r806987758-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"

Yes certainly, but certain basic principles should be covered for a 250€ per person experience- no matter the stars ⭐️ attached :
1) A nice welcome & friendly front of house
2) Sommelier - knowledgeable if possible 
3) An amuse-bouche ou au minimum bread & olive oil or some olives (sorry, every average Italian around the corner offers that …)
4) An Alternative if someone has diatery constraints for one dish of the menue
5) A chocolate or cookie with the coffee 
6) A table decoration in August which doesn’t remind Christmas  🎄 in the 70th with a green shawl and the white candle-triple-set from Ikea (which you cannot light on as too much wind outside…)

So even if the chef has a bad day regarding the food like in our case, 1-6 could and should be assured.

So we are all 4 very disappointed… sorry!!!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/b4/9e/d3/caption.jpg

Yes, it's expensive, but as is NOT often the case with such multi-starred high-flying restaurants, it is totally worth it. The Ballade des Baux menu is incredible, the sequence of amuse-bouches and dishes is stunning, the seasoning and cooking levels are perfect, course after course after course. The service is spot-on, with the right mix of formalism and pragmaticism. The terrace is sublime. To top it off, there is a proper plateau de Fromages, which is a dying tradition in French restaurants... thanks for keeping this flame alive!

Now, the anecdote: The menu includes snails... I am a sucker for snails, which my grandparents used to ""hunt"" and cook when I was a kid, so I have a special link to them. My daughter and wife a bit less as it is such a polarizing product, even if you've never tried it before. They both requested that this dish got swapped for another course, the waiter came back to us and mentioned that the chef insisted that they try it, although another dish (zucchini flower in Tempura, iirc) would be served to them no matter what. The ladies went ahead, tried it and enjoyed it fully, hurray! The staff forgot the tempura in the meantime but I forgive them, as my wife and daughter have now climbed a major step in the French Gastronomy ladder, thanks to MM. Charial and Viel.

Merci et Bravo!","1","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-08-08","2021-08-08","en","L'Oustau de Baumaniere","4453621","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r802588960-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html"
