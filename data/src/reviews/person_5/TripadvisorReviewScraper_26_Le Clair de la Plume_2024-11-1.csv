Service by the young staff was fast and enthusiastic. Menu is limited and the food was good if a bit on the expensive side, but the location was magnificent, with tables tucked away in amongst the garden with view across lavender fields to the ChÃ¢teau.

Sponsored by IKEA maybe ??? (Glass wear, cutlery etc...) Main dish ""the tuna"" was very nice, but spoiled by a dessert of the day being served in a plastic pot. Come on people, this is Clair de la Plume not Mc D's. Then to top it all, top money for a coffee, served in the brand's own cup.

The reservation done through a web site. The welcome was chilly or just lukewarm. The menu proposed a ""Tablier de Sapeur"". It could be good, but depends on the day. No way to change. We had to insist hardly to get finally 2 pieces of salad. Other plates just middling. But don't worry, the price stayed high !
What a shame ! Grignan is a most beautiful place in Provence.
Fortunately, there are other restaurants in this place where you could spend good time with friends or family.","0","","FAMILY","2015-03-31","2015-04-17","2015-04-17","en","Le Jardin Du Clair De La Plume","4519864","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g445033-d4519864-r266257482-Le_Jardin_Du_Clair_De_La_Plume-Grignan_Drome_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

The food was excellent, the menu varied and interesting and the service was good too. The desserts deserve special mention because they are outstanding.","0","","COUPLES","2013-09-30","2013-10-30","2013-10-30","en","Le Jardin Du Clair De La Plume","4519864","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g445033-d4519864-r182985871-Le_Jardin_Du_Clair_De_La_Plume-Grignan_Drome_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"
