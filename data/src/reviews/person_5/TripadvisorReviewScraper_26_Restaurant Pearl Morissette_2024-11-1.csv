While the experience was excellent we will likely not return - did not feel it was worth the money we paid and we would have appreciated more local Ontario items on the menu.  

We were provided with a menu at the end but it would have been better to have it at the beginning so you could refer to it as you were eating - the servers explained each meal but by the time they left the table we had forgotten most of the ingredients.  And the $6 charge for tea left a bad taste given what we had paid for the meal - surely the restaurant can afford to absorb that.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-14","2024-10-14","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r973893130-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

Atmosphere: 5","A memorable and delectable annual Joint Brother-in-law Birthday Bash at a newly crowned Michelin Green & Red Star.","With weather still unseasonably warm and comfortable, it is nice to take advantage and venture outside of the normal GTA core for an occasional chowdown or two.
For me, PM is the only trusted out-of-town, fine dining establishment featuring a tasting menu option that is within reasonable driving distance from home. Most of all, their offering reflects the quintessential in ‘ farm-to-table’ dining, incorporating a total culinary package that is always consistent, assuring and exceptional…..and now the trademark of a double Michelin Red and Green stars recipient!

It has been almost a year since I last drove out to PM and savored the wonderful and ever-changing creative cuisine of PM’s ‘ dynamic duo chefs ‘ - Daniel Hadida and Eric Robertson…….not to mention visiting their flocks of free range chicken and ducks, grass fed cattles and the impressive vegetable and herb garden!

For the past three decades, due to the close proximity of our birthdays, my brother-in-law and I had been holding regular annual, husband-only, joint birthday bashes at different venues all over Ontario and Quebec. Fine dining establishments with tasting menus and wine pairing offerings were our preferred venue options. This year, meeting our primary criteria with ease, we decided to pay PM a long overdue re-visit!
Our luncheon culinary experience started off with a walk around the restaurant complex, a close encounter with some free-run ‘ Silken Chicken ‘ and a sampling of Chardonnay grapes from the 2024 harvest! Very ripe and sweet! IMHO, it could be a very good vintage year!

As in the past, after climbing the challenging ‘32 steps‘ flight of stairs to the spectacular upper level dining room, we were welcomed warmly by both chefs, outside of the open-kitchen. This time, with added significance, since we are shaking hands with Michelin star chefs!

In light of growing health and safety concerns, we have decided to pass on the wine pairing option. In lieu of, we both settled for a glass of their house-special Champagne plus a glass of their very aromatic, 2019 ‘ Irreverance ‘ ( Orange Riesling, Chardonnay & Gewurztraminer ).
The creative dishes of our 12-course ‘Omakase’ tasting menu were visually impressive and relishing. The masterful menu was well thought of and conceived, featuring a balanced and diverse offering of dishes with a focus on seafood and pasture raised fowls and animals. Most dishes feature major components with complex and multidimensional taste profiles, augmented with an interesting array of vegetable sides. The ‘ too beautiful to disturb and eat ‘ artful plating elevated to an even higher level than before. Again, some never before seen or tasted, uncommon ‘organic‘ ingredients adorned our plates ( eg., local ‘Golden’ Strawberries, ‘Autumn’ Petit Pois! )……the advantage of owning a herb/vegetable garden and close proximity to local farms! To reflect their recipient of the Green Star, I was told by the chefs, ALL ingredients used from now on, especially the vegetables, will be organically grown either in-house or locally. The protein, local, organic, wild or free run!

Coupled with impeccable, warm and friendly front-of-house service and care, our near perfect meal was once again foodie and praise worthy. My ONLY very minor and superficial criticism pertains to the slight ‘overhanded‘ use of salt in the delectable sauces of a few dishes….the Lobster, the Cod and the Duck.
No big deal! Part of living in an imperfect world!!

Looking forward to returning for the Fall menu!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/b6/76/41/caption.jpg

1 oz of pork with 2 tiny onions does not a main course make!
Was the pork delicious? You bet.  Was the restaurant lovely- absolutely.  
I firmly believe you can do Michelin star food without being overly pretentious though.- passing off teeny tiny portions for crazy money and a three month wait list…

Service as would be expected excellent, attentive, very knowledgeable staff, professional yet friendly and relaxed. Happy to talk at the table with confidence. Dishes were presented by both chefs and servers, i love to see the kitchen involved in the service, all showed pride and excitement with their food. 
Worth noting no full bar only a limited range of certain spirits... no mixers.
However you go to PM for the food, ranked in Top 5 restaurants in Canada so I had high expectations and as Jools had visited in Summer last year and been blown away, I was expecting something special. Did i get it?? Sorry, not quite. Yes there were 3 or 4 real stand out dishes of the 10 course tasting menu, but it just did not live up to the hype. Was it due to it being winter and the seasonal produce available? 
Look, experience was still very good, just not great.
Stand outs... Bision Tartare, wow, melt in the mouth, lovely flavor.
Nubian Goat, tender, strong flavor.
Rasberry Sobet in Meringue, gapow!! Intense flavor, crispy meringue.

But then course 10, a ""Babka"", a nice Babka but what was it doing at the end of the meal, too heavy, poor menu planning, I'd have left it as a nine course tasting menu.

I'll try again in the summer and hope for a more balanced ""seasonal"" menu.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/42/e4/e6/caption.jpg

Advance forward to present day! 
Rated in the top 100 restaurants in Canada the last couple of years, however did they pull that off with the meal we were served!?? Drunk food critiques? Paid off food critiques??
From start to finish we had excellent service! Provided you could hear them or understand them explaining the dishes they served you.
A 10 course meal, I had my friend all hyped up about this new restaurant for her to try……unfortunately I felt embarrassed for bring her there for an evening that was suppose to be a magical food experience but still was an expensive comedy relief for us to enjoy each others company and guess which one of the servers cooked the dish that was being served to us! For it certainly could not possibly been a chef!  Possible a chef with a head cold because there was very little flavour in anything!
The pork dish served was so tough you had a hard time cutting it and then chew chew chew ….
A dish served with “Hogget” what is Hogget you may ask? It is a lamb that is to be between 12-18 months old….my guess it was old enough to vote! It was so tough you could not cut it, and then it came down to chew and swallow , or chew and spit out!
A dish with Geoduck in it ….unfortunately mine had a bit of grit in it, probably sand….flash back of sand box at preschool ….
There was not one dish that you would say OMG that was incredible!
Although I did get my friend to say it by asking her to close her eyes when tasting one of the sauces and said picture campbells cream of mushroom soup, to which she replied OMG the chef must be standing back laughing his ass off at all these people eating this campbells soup! To which we both burst out laughing.
Thank goodness we could laugh because at a price tag of $492 for the two of us , with no alcohol …we needed some humor for the wasted evening!
If you could live on sour dough bread you will make out fine! The bread was the best part of the meal, and had most of the flavour!  Although there was one dish with habanero pepper it was nice to have one kick ass flavour!","5","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/89/08/26/caption.jpg

The food was tasty, beautifully presented, and appropriately priced for what it was but nothing made me think omg, this is the best thing ever. When we do a tasting menu like this, I expect at least one of those moments. there was also a missed opportunity for an amuse bouche and final dinner sweet with the bill which is pretty standard for meals like this, in my experience. The service was wonderfully friendly, but not stellar -- towards the end of the meal we had three sets of empty wine glasses on the table which wasn't terrible, but not expected for a venue of this quality and reputation.  I have to comment on the wine pairings because I tried to get some advance info on them from reviews and wasn't very successful. If money is no object, by all means it was interesting and I'm sure we tasted some things we'd not find elsewhere. But 6 2oz glasses of wine which were tasty and well matched, but not exceptional, for $135 is nuts. We didn't look at the regular wine menu because this was a special occasion and we'd decided in advance to do the pairings,  so I can't say what wine by the glass (or even bottle) cost, but my recommendation would be to have a look at the wine menu and get the sommelier to suggest 2 or 3 glasses to match the menu. The space itself is lovely and spacious, and having service included in the prices is a really nice touch. Again, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience -- it was a lovely night out, and I have no regrets, but it was not a life changing meal, and I've had those for a similar or lower price. I hope this is helpful for anyone who is waffling about making a reservation or choosing to go with the wine pairings.","1","","COUPLES","2023-06-30","2023-06-07","2023-06-07","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r893930315-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

Take the time, make the reservation and enjoy food at its finest.
Local fair brought to a level normally not experienced.
Will definitely return in the Summer to experience more from Chefs Hadida and Robertson. 
Telling you what we had will not help, as by the time you go it will have changed.
But, I assure you, whatever you have will be worth the drive.

I will recommend the juice pairing ( for the driver) great experience.

The service was impecable with every member of the staff being knowledage and attentive, without being """"hovering"". We had the 10 course sampler, and each couple shared a wine pairing. Having the 10 course sampler meant you tried dishes what you may not normally order. An example was the Sea Urchin, which was a favourite.   Similarly with the wine, you got to try some Italian white wines which we did not knew existed. Not cheap, but wirththe money for the experience.","1","","NONE","2023-01-31","2023-01-28","2023-01-28","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r876620279-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

The food was creative with explosions of unexpected flavour, beautifully presented and delivered by dedicated staff who had their eye on detail and a positive guest experience.  The setting in the tent was quirky and fun and reminded you of where your food came from.  Add in the glorious fall day in Niagara, and you could not ask for anything more!  I highly recommend this dining experience for anyone planning a visit to Niagara.

Food: 5","A Beautiful Evening Under the Tent","This is Pearl Morissette's last month outdoors under their tent and we were glad to have experienced it. Prepared for a chilly evening, we found the tent to be pleasantly warm (even without the available blankets) and very inviting. What was greenery spreading over the ceiling in summer, is now delicately dried and brown--but it suits the fall weather and candlelit atmosphere. 
Servers and staff are well-trained and attentive, pleasant and very accommodating. Due to an allergy at our table (they asked at time of booking), the kitchen had prepared special dishes without certain ingredients (eggs & milk). In one case, the altered dish was better than the original! 
That said, all the food was terrific-- imaginative, complementary flavour combinations created using as much local product as possible, including many ingredients grown on the farm surrounding the restaurant. Even with ingredients like sablefish (aka black cod) which can sometimes have an overwhelming taste, the fusion of flavours was excellent. 
The wine list is extensive, although we opted for the wine pairing. Our sommelier was well-versed and interested in giving us the best experience possible. She even changed up one pairing to something she thought we would better enjoy, based on our comments as dinner went on.
Over all, this was a beautiful evening and one we greatly enjoyed.","0","","NONE","2022-10-31","2022-10-27","2022-10-27","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r866192281-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

The food was mediocre, some dishes good, some just bad - but nothing mins blowing. The ambiance and atmosphere was not there, and the service from the various 9-10 people who came to our table was inconsistent and weird. The price point is very high and you may as well pit stop for pizza on your way home because it is not a filling 9 course. There are much better restaurants to spend $250$+ per person. Also the bathrooms are literally outside in a trailer. Elevated porta potties.","2","","COUPLES","2022-10-31","2022-10-22","2022-10-22","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r865490668-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

Food: 5","Excellent Experience","Pearl Morissette is topnotch. The tasting menu could be considered pricey, but it is  more than worth it. Their dishes are creative, the flavour combinations are unique and the plating is lovely. The wine pairings are perfect; a combination of local and international vintages were excellent complements to the food. The servers are polite, unobtrusive and pleasant. Such care is taken with allergies (they ask in advance), that the chefs redesign some dishes to accommodate food sensitivities at a particular table. 
We ate outdoors in the enclosed tent, which was comfortable and warm, despite the near freezing weather that night. Minimalist decor with an emphasis on plants and nature were the perfect setting for the meal which relies heavily on local ingredients, especially those grown on the farm immediately outside.
Highly recommend.","1","","NONE","2022-10-31","2022-10-20","2022-10-20","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r865300924-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

However we would like to add that we were dismayed to discover that the toilets were outside and were basically slightly upgraded Porta-Potties.  
We have had much better fine dining experiences for less money in Toronto, Vancouver and Jerome Ferrer's - 'Europea' in Montreal being our absolute favourite.  
On a positive note the wine pairings were excellent.","2","","NONE","2022-09-30","2022-10-19","2022-10-19","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r865209912-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"

Although it was good overall, it just didn’t meet our expectations. To me a good restaurant is a place where you would want to go back and I can’t say that I want to return to Pearl Morissette. I’m a foodie and unfortunately this experience was just a check mark on my “bucket list”.  Good service and great atmosphere, very romantic. The food portions were small. I mean really small. One of the courses was two tiny baby potatoes. I don’t expect a place like that to have big portions, but you do want to feel at least half satisfied after a meal. We though since it was nine course meal we’d feel different towards the end but then the deserts came and we were disappointed.  I’m very picky when it comes to food and I liked most dishes but there were few that I didn’t. The duck was a bit too rare, very chewy. It is just my opinion but all four of us thought ot would be nice if it was cooked just a bit longer. 
I feel bad giving this place 3 star review because had good time. But on the other hand after 4 months wait and the most expensive meal I’ve ever had I feel there is something missing.","9","","FRIENDS","2022-07-31","2022-08-23","2022-08-23","en","Restaurant Pearl Morissette","13168199","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r855914932-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html"
