I was there for dinner with a friend (his first time to the restaurant) a couple of days ago. We both enjoyed our meal.

We took the 7-course menu. The 5 savoury dishes included 2 dishes ((a) the signature aka uni and (b) foie gras Brussels sprout) which were also served during my dinner in Amber earlier this year. 

Other savoury dishes were:
- Alaskan king crab 
- Kinmedai (served in the kitchen where I’d the pleasure of meeting Chef Richard Ekkebus again) 
- Pigeon 

All of them were very delicious but the pigeon dish was by far the most impressive. The meat was of outstanding quality and cooked to perfection. It’s cooked medium rare but when I cut it there wasn’t any hint of blood. The small slice of flesh on top of the dish was very juicy and tender. Okinawa corn on the side was very sweet. 

The 2 desserts weren’t bad. However, they paled in comparison to the savoury dishes. 

The service was smooth and seamless. All staff were very professional. Almost 4 hours passed by easily. 

4.5 out of 5 overall.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/92/fc/08/caption.jpg

餐廳搜羅世界各地優質食材設計菜式，廚師團隊運用不同配搭製作出出色佳餚，每道菜式配搭出不同味道層次，令食客味蕾充滿驚喜。加上餐廳服務專業，對食材及廚師處理都清晰講解，態度親切健談。
無論環境、食物及服務都是一流水準，餐廳連續 16
年贏得米芝蓮兩星殊榮，確實至名歸。
有機會務必試試［Full Amber experience］，除能夠品嚐完完整整主廚設計嘅餐單，仲可以參觀兩星餐廳
嘅廚房並觀看由廚師即場炮製其中一道菜，非常難得
嘅體驗。
餐單會因應食材供應而作出更改，但招牌菜［Aka
Uni • Cauliflower• Lobster •Royal Cristal Caviar 1 I
定on list，而且食過絕對係難以忘記嗰種細緻幼滑震撼味蕾嘅味道及質感
餐廳亦會因應客人對食物喜好作出即時安排，例如本人唔喜歡牛肉及羊肉，餐廳亦會有其他選擇代替，我的主菜改為鮫魚，做得亦非常出色，濃郁魚鮮又保留鮫魚特有質感。
整套菜單非常豐盛，食到甜品已經撐破肚皮。當中最愛是招牌菜海膽椰菜花蓉配魚子醬，鴨肝亦非常出色","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/24/c3/9d/caption.jpg

The service was slow, several mistakes (it really wasn't that busy) and when we pointed the mistakes out (wrong food , wrong bill amounts) they made it seem as if it was our mistake and not theirs while they tried to sort it out. The food was all fine but only fine, given the hype they have been making about it we were expecting something special but it was all just very average. A real shame because as I say the decor really is stunning!","0","","FAMILY","2024-06-30","2024-07-15","2024-07-15","en","Amber","939504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r959644205-Amber-Hong_Kong.html"

The decoration is light luxurious yet very soothing. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.

I love every single dish. The serving time was very precise. You can't miss the signature Uni with cauliflower, lobster and caviar. It has a very exquisite and complex texture and the seaweed crisps on the side was a cherry on top!

It was such a great experience to enter to the kitchen and have a glance of how the magic is done. Staff patiently explained the history and concept of the restaurant. I do appreciate how Amber puts a lot of effort presenting exceptionally delicious dishes while committing to ESG, with diary free and sustainable ingredients.

Overall, it's a value for money Michelin star restaurant.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/25/ea/80/caption.jpg

The tasting menu featured some very fresh and high quality ingredients. While all savoury dishes were very delicious, the following were particularly memorable:

1. the iconic Aka Uni dish 
2. Normandy scallop with winter truffle which we had in the kitchen 
3. French lamb which comprised 3 different parts. The meat was perfectly cooked. It’s very tender and juicy with a unique fragrance. 

The dessert wasn’t bad. But I’m kind of old-school and would have preferred some traditional or classic French pastry dessert. 

As always, the service was impeccable. All the staff were professional, knowledgeable and courteous. 

Highly recommended.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/82/3f/09/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Extraordinary experience for our 20th Anniversary","My wife and I and our daughter celebrated our 20th Anniversary at Amber last night. I personnally had been for dinner and lunch before, but not my wife.

The ambiance:
The restaurant was re-decorated a few years ago and the new decoration looks much better than before. Newer style, very clean, the tables are very spacious. The restaurant was only half full last night so it was also very quiet. Everything on the table was clean and tidy, as it should be with a 2 Michelin star restaurant.

The staff:
The staff is well trained, very amicable and willing to chat just the right amount. The dishes were explained very clearly and my wife (who is an excellent cook herself) was able to ask questions. Getting the attention of the staff was no issue.

Visit of the kitchen:
With our Full Amber Experience came a visit of the kitchen. A nice touch that we appreciated, which I don't think too many restaurants in HK offer. Our Spanish Mackerel dish was prepared before our eyes by the chef with full explanation. We then had our dish in the kitchen while the chef was explaining to us how the whole kitchen is working. A totally cool experience.

The wine list:
The wine list is extensive and comparable to Restaurant Petrus for example, and more extensive than Gaddis. The markups are a little on the high side compared to other fine dining restaurants in HK. I had chosen my wine in advance and went with a 2012 Malhadinha (a red Portuguese wine) that lived up to my expextations entirely. The glasses used by the sommelier were the correct ones.

The food:
The menu is an absolute masterpiece. Each dish is extremely well crafted, the ingredients used of the highest quality. The flavours are very complex and goes along very well with the presentation of the dishes. 2 things to note:
- the menus are entirely sustainably sourced and Amber gets a Green Star from Michelin for this.
- there is a vegetarian menu option, which my daughter ordered, and the portions are meaningfully more copious than the non-vegetarian menu, similar to my previous experience at Amber. Not an issue of course, but worth noting.

Our Anniversary dinner was a complete success, and we'll definitely come back to Amber.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/75/e4/caption.jpg

We liked the softer ambiance and the natural light filled space.

The dishes were meticulously put together with taste profiles as precisely executed as we could remember. We chose the “Extended Amber Experience” with four courses and it was sumptuous and satisfying.

We were delighted by the prawn consommé which was flavoursome, the tooth fish and scallop with was tender with freshness, the duck that was so gamey, while the signature Red Sea Urchin “cauliflower” lobster caviar was as memorable as our last visit.

The petit four combo was one of the most impressive with fruits, and freshly made Ying Yang (coffee and tea) mix.

Staff were professional and attentive, who explained each dish clearly; and the wine list comprehensive and advice was spot on - the range of wine-by-the-glass is large.

We enjoyed the experience from start to finish, with each element working nicely together.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/2e/b9/ad/caption.jpg

The Wagyu was of high quality and the dessert was good.

The amouse bouche was tasteless and lacked seasoning. The starter was burrata - it may be nice that it is made from soy, but it tastes terrible. The next starter was tuna, which you can get in this quality at the discounter around the corner. The prawns in the next course were specially imported from France, which is how they taste, i.e. freshly defrosted. The scallops were made into a mousse, what a shame for the mussels. The lobster tail was tough and didn't smell of fresh lobster, here too the product was poor. You can get the duck in much better quality at the Chinese street food restaurant, this one was tough and dry!

They boast about their Michelin green star and make their butter from coconut, which makes it very tasteless. They make the Madeleine without gluten and butter, actually this disgrace of sweet tastelessness shouldn't be called Madeleine anymore.

They import the tomatoes from Japan, the shrimps from the South of France, the fruit from Thailand and so on. I have no problem with that, but then to pretend to be super sustainable just because the knife board is made of hurricane wood is just ridiculous.

All the dishes lack spice and are not seasoned.

As mentioned in the title, Paul Bocuse would turn in his grave if he called this French cuisine and I was there...

But what I forgot, the bill was hefty...USD 1000 for a miserable 6-course meal with a bottle of wine that costs USD 28 to buy.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2023-12-07","2023-12-07","en","Amber","939504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r928723290-Amber-Hong_Kong.html"

Best Cuisine! Best Service! 
4 Michelin Stars + 1 Green Michelin Star!

It was an unforgettable experience in Amber the Landmark Mandarin Oriental. My friend and I booked a table for 2 in Amber for a special Four Hands Dinner of Amber x Syrco BASE in 13 Courses menu. I really enjoyed the new concept of Amber restaurant after the renovation. 
(Amber's progressive menu showcases pure flavours, masterful techniques and chef Richard Ekkebus's creative vision. Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt.
Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)

Needless to say the guest chef Syrco created an amazing & interesting menu with the combination of Dutch & Indonesian flavours. My favourite dishes are the Pigeon Kobocha Foie Gras from Amber and the Grouper Turmeric Cabbage from Syrco BASE. Looking forward to the new restaurant Syrco BASE opening in Bali in Q4 2023. I will definitely recommend these two restaurants for everyone.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/a9/cb/94/caption.jpg
