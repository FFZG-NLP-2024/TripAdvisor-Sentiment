The restaurant is located in a private space within one of the most prestigious hotels in Athens, The Margi hotel. The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing while the served dishes were delicious! The highlights of our menu degustation is the bread (mind blowing!!) and the fish soup (one of the signature dishes of the restaurant); we loved the fact that all products in the menu are produced in private farm of The Margi hotel; huge turn to sustainability!! Last but not least, we enjoyed the professionalism of service team; being friendly but professional and ready to assist  it was an contributing factor that made our experience extravagant !! It's a MUST VISIT restaurant when being in Athens!!!","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-12","2024-07-11","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r959103875-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"

The food was delicious, subtle and beautifully presented. The wine was very fine and well matched. Memorable dishes include an amuse bouche with white chocolate and caviar, a savoury strawberry soup, sea urchin mousse, and lobster with a savoury fruit salad.
The service was efficient, warm and knowledgeable. Polydoros, our waiter, was lovely. Hearing that we were headed to Santorini, he took the time to give us great advice about locations and food, wine to experience there.
We had a wonderful evening and loved every moment of it.","0","","COUPLES","2018-05-31","2018-05-27","2018-05-27","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r583062697-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"

We had their Greek (left side) 6-course tasting menu with the Greek wine pairings - the meal started with an aperitif of 4 different small delicious treats and then a sundried strawberry and hazelnut amuse-bouche paired with a sparkling rose wine, moved onto a sea urchin dish, a choice of scallops or lobster (I had the lobster, which was served with the best mango/mint/other things I can't remember salad I've ever tasted), a cod dish (my favorite) which they served with their aged sourdough and homemade olive oil (definitely going home with a few bottles, you can't buy them online!!), an amazing lamb sous vide, a selection of Greek cheeses, and ending with a millefeuille and cherry sorbet. The dishes were consistently delicious, the presentation was beautiful, the wine pairings were 100% on point, and our server Zacharias was attentive and informative and made us feel comfortable and at home.

For anyone living in or visiting this area, I cannot sing my praises loudly enough for this restaurant. The ONLY critique I can offer is that the Margi does not promote this restaurant enough. Also, the restaurant is only open during the summer and only on weekdays, but it is still quite new (2 years old I believe) and my hope is that they will gain more well-deserved popularity and attract a broader clientele which may allow them to stay open during peak weekend hours. Their style of dining is not for everyone, but for the price and quality this should be a destination for couples and groups of adults looking for an exciting, sophisticated night out and a meal that is more art than food. I recently ate at L'Espadon at the Ritz in Paris (2 Michelin stars) and La Tour d'Argent (1 Michelin star) and while I am no food critic, the meal I had last night at Patio was a very close rival, if not better in some respects, and CERTAINLY better in terms of the price.

12/10 would dine here again.","3","","COUPLES","2017-07-31","2017-07-22","2017-07-22","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r504375416-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"

We chose a 9-course degustation menu and we got really impressed both food-wise and service-wise. We not gonna share too much about food, cause everyone appreciates more the beauty of the ""unexpected"" and also the name of the Executive Chef Panagiotis Giakalis speaks for itself. We may give a praise to Zaharias who took care of our entire meal (3 hours duration) with such a professional and stylish way.

Patio restaurant consists of 9 tables in total and it is the ideal place for a unique, semiprivate and romantic dinner. We would definitely come back.

P.S. Altough we are dessert lovers we found that 3 courses of sweets were somehow too much. However, we must mention that they were perfectly balanced with some citrus fruits which made the sugar content ""invisible"".","1","","COUPLES","2017-07-31","2017-07-15","2017-07-15","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r502127916-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"

We can easily compare it to the one you're left with when leaving 2 or 3 michelin stared restaurants. The menu consists of 2 degustation menus (we chose the one based on Greek flavours) and some a la carte options. The two dishes that stood out: The lobster on homemade pasta filled with smoked aubergine & courgettes & the lamb with a potato & rosemary terrine and pea-sesame oil pure. The only thing that we could say was missing was a bit more light at the table, but that made the ambience very romantic.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/0d/d3/1a/photo-of-the-restaurant.jpg","COUPLES","2016-07-31","2016-07-17","2016-07-17","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r393579518-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"

Desi ( the guest relation manager) suggest us Patio if we wanted something special. We are very happy that we did it. Scallops and cod fish are plates that we will never forget! Also the desserts peach and masticha are some of the best we have ever try!
Restaurant manager Vasilis was amazing too! We felt like we had a Michelin star experience! ","2","","NONE","2016-07-31","2016-07-15","2016-07-15","en","Patio","10523457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r392773893-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html"
