The welcome is warm, cozy.... The premises are very cozy , all in subtlety with splendid views of the surrounding mountains.
Your bag, ma'am, will be welcome in a little attention of boiled wool by the fire.
The shared cocktail enchants us with subtle fragrances from the nearby nature.
Then, it is a succession of delicate dishes that only a forthcoming visit will allow you to share the feeling....
Throughout this journey, which combines taste discoveries and eye pleasures, everything is perfect, divine:
Efficient and harmonious service.
The sweet descriptions that invite our taste buds to begin this tender gourmet journey.
Bread produced by the chef ..... Real killing.
The advice of Camille who shares her passion for the good bottles of our wine regions.
A special mention for tomato pie which is a real work of art in terms of presentation. 
Count 360 euros per person for this unique menu, with cocktail, and a Menetou Salon.
These beautiful moments made us forget that we had to leave this prestigious Hostel because we felt at our best.
But to come back to it better....you have to decide to leave...
Congratulations ,Sandrine and Florian for this intense work that filled us.
See you very soon....","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/96/9b/53/caption.jpg

The dishes are presented on walnut containers designed by the chef himself (incredible?). The room is intimate, our favorite style, but unfortunately a little noisy. 
On the dishes there are many flowers, plants, fruits, all worked with noble products. Tomato pie could be a birthday cake, of such beauty! 
The negatives: if the third star is envisaged, you will have to review the toilet... There is no special attention for an event to celebrate and the menu is not printed (for those who like to keep it as a souvenir it will be sent to you by email). The Chef is present in the room throughout the meal, but does not come to see his guests at the end. For those who love gastronomy this moment of rewarding exchange is not negligible! 
The two desserts we had were almost identical in terms of taste, presentation and even texture: there is one too many that should be replaced by cuteness (which we do not have with hot drinks). 
I conclude with a very positive Rating: the team! All employees are amazingly kind, welcoming and kind! They work with a smile and make this moment even more enjoyable! Congratulations to Sandrine, the Chef’s wife, who manages her team perfectly! A faultless service, bravo!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/5e/4f/8d/caption.jpg

The best table we have discovered in a very long time. We already want to come back!
Just one (microscopic) suggestion, to accompany this perfect seasonal menu composed by the chef: offer a printed menu to guests? To prolong the moment and keep the memory...","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/cf/be/e8/caption.jpg

A palette of colors and flavors that make it a great moment of emotion. A sharing concept that further increases the pleasure.
Everything is just right and perfect.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/cc/4c/19/caption.jpg

Florian's culinary mastery has further progressed and his unique menu is a true symphony that Sandrine accompanies with talent and enthusiasm.
So a festival. The only downside at the end of the meal is that Florian could come and greet his guests instead of devoting himself to a single table of privileged people...

Le tout magnifiquement orchestré par une équipe au top, merci pour votre accueil chaleureux.
La vaisselle est authentique et originale.
Le cadre intimiste.
Le menu unique et surprise est très intéressant.

Les 2 étoiles sont méritées, bravo !!

Néanmoins il est dommage que nous soyons partis sans accompagnement d'un membre du personnel alors qu'il a été très présent durant tout le diner.

Je recommande vivement !!!","0","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-07-14","2023-07-13","fr","L'auberge De Montmin","17727911","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3528948-d17727911-r902871544-L_auberge_De_Montmin-Montmin_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"
