What they do with food is astonishing both in style and flavour 

Each of the tiny courses on the many-coursed tasting menu seems like the most delightful thing you have ever tasted and you marvel at how they did it 

We did the wine pairing which does rack the bill up substantially but it adds a ton of value to the experience with many glassss and in many cases of drinks you would not have tried but find you adore

It’s a four hour gig and is expensive 

Our bill was north of €900 for two and I recognise we are in a fortunate position to afford this but here’s the thing 

It’s worth it","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-11","2024-10-11","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r973429262-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

We took the long menu and Jesús Sanchez led us with a ""in crescendo"" thread to the end.
Starting with his appetizers and the pintxos reinterpreted modernizing the classics.
His cocido and a series of dishes with the master's brushstrokes that gently lead you to his work with the bonito, the grouper, the carrot game and his spectacular pigeon.
His dishes are beautiful while he manages to bring out the intense flavour of the products.
The desserts, very suitable after such a banquet, one less sweet and the other to choose between a chocolate enjoyment or a last deconstruction, and the petit fours arrive a last wink to the menu closes it with elegance.

All the food is excellent : very refined and light, tasty, varied. With exceptionally good dishes such as : Consommé of Morcilla tapa;  main course of Pigeon stuffed with leak & mushroom, on a mixed vegetable base, in a rich sauce, with mustard, broccoli trunk & soufflé potatoes; and a pre-dessert of citric Passion Fruit and Yogurt Ice-cream stuffed with Mango and Apple. 
Only small complaints, the exploding mustard balls with the pigeon, and the slightly heavy Raviole starter. 

All the glasses of wines proposed with the menu are very good. 

High calibre service, plentiful staff, and warm welcome. Although the head waiter can come over as a bit as tense and cold. For example, not offering an aperitif upon arrival. 

Before arriving at your table, one is offered an original tour of the manor, including through the wine cellar and its own bakery, with a visit to two different salons for aperitifs. 

Relaxing atmosphere, in a very nice, interesting building, leaving an impression of tradition with a modern touch. Well spaced tables, and well frequented that lunch-time. Although the air-conditioning is rather too cool. 

Well worth the higher price compared with the 1-star Michelin restaurants in the area.","2","","NONE","2019-06-30","2019-08-18","2019-08-18","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r700223579-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

FOR:
This restaurant deserves its Michelin stars: the cuisine is excellent.
The staff are attentive.
The place is impressive,the building historic.
If you are a gourmet, or a professional food expert/writer, you will probably enjoy this experience.
AGAINST:
The cuisine is complex. Nothing is simple. Dishes are served in small elegant portions - don't come here if you are hungry, or suffer from a healthy appetite!
Be prepared for a large bill: elegance has its price.
The staff is very attentive and polite but service is slow: over two hours for lunch may be enjoyed by some, but for older people it can be an ordeal. Service is choreographed: I find it over the top and would prefer a more down-to-earth approach. If I want choreography I go to the ballet.
The building is in an out-of-the-way village which is badly signposted. We drove for miles - be sure to have an efficient sat nav.
The very historic building needs better lighting at the entrance: ancient stone slabs and unlit steps may be authentic but are dangerous.

Food: 5","One of kind lunch","In a village just off the main roads one can find the beautiful Centador de Amos. There is the event location on the far end of the property that I can only imagine to be a dream wedding location. There is plenty of parking space and there are hosts waiting to welcome you into the venue. It makes you feel right at home and it is immediately clear that this will be a treat. As we did not speak Spanish they made sure there was always someone who spoke english to ensure we could comfortably ask any question and were offered an English menu. 

We started with a choice of one of the set menus outside in the lounge where we chose the middle menu “Esencia” (75E IVA included). We were taken to a bigger room inside where a few other tables were already enjoying their lunch. The tables were well spaced for enough privacy and every guest seemed to feel just as much of a special guest. The servers made their best effort to make some small talk, but were mostly very unobtrustive and were right there anytime you would like something or even right before. The timing was great for every dish and the teamwork was astonishing. 

The food was amazing, especially the amuses and appetizers were out of this world. The “Caramelized Foie”, “Coastal Tuna” were among my personal highlights as well as the regional favourite of Sardines only this time in a modern setting. All the dishes were quite a large portion so don’t worry about going home hungry.. Also because of the bread that was supplied which also tasted amazing. I won’t give away too much on the contents as the tastes were quite surprising but never unpleasant. After the dinner we were seated in the sun in the lounge again and enjoyed some great complimentary petits fours with our espresso. 

Certainly recommended. At least at the higher-end of the one star spectrum well worth the time to travel here and the money.","0","","COUPLES","2016-08-31","2016-08-10","2016-08-10","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r403695810-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

Food: 5","Spanish Cooking at its best","We booked this restaurant for lunch on a Thursday during our holiday to Cantabria. The restaurant was empty apart from us but it didn't feel like it. The staff were great with our dreadful Spanish and complete lack of understanding of Spanish cuisine. The place has a lovely balance of old and new.

So, the food. For starters my daughter (11) and I both had the cod salad which was basically raw cod, which had been 'cooked' in lemon juice. The eleven year old wolfed it down declaring it 'wonderful'. My if had a cocido or bean stew which had the most int nose flavour either of us had come across. For mains, my daughter had a poached hake dish which was perfectly cooked. My wife went for chicken with black rice, while I ordered what I had expected to be a beef stew of some kind, but turned out to be tripe and possibly lungs; it was gorgeous. The only reason all plates were not wiped clean was that the portions were very generous. For dessert we had a meille feuille, and two apple tarts.

The Wien list, as you would expect is extensive, but priced remarkably fairly. Strong representation from most Spanish regions including Mallorca which was a surprise as we haven't seen their wines outside the island before. We went for  hefty red from Toro, which I had been dying to try for ages. Prices are very reasonable as seems to be the case throughout Cantabria.

All in all a fabulous meal in lively surroundings. The dishes were traditional regional fare but given a twist or made special. This is a fantastic restaurant and we would like to thank the staff who took the time to explain things to us. Next time I'll pay more attention when they say 'tripe'. It wasn't a dish I would have chosen, but I'm very glad I had it because it was truly delicious.","0","","FAMILY","2015-10-31","2015-10-30","2015-10-30","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r323243778-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

Well thought out, well explained and just amazing to eat. Such a variation of tastes and quality presentation. Oh, and you will be comfortably full! The wine list is a wine lovers delight. We settled for one of the many Gran Reserva Riojas and was not disappointed. The mark ups are minimal too! The waiters were excellent. Very efficient and unobtrusive. They also spoke excellent English. Don't be afraid of taking children with you. They accommodated by producing a dish of less rich and daunting food that our 12 year old loved!!!, however, to her delight, the selection of children's pudding was from the a la carte menu and didn't disappoint. The atmosphere in some Michelin starred restaurants can be a little pretentious. Not here.

The restaurant was full - Saturday night and Mother's Day weekend. We didn't have to worry about our poor Spanish as not only had the whole menu had been translated it also made perfect sense! The four of us chose the middle price tasting menu at €60. Individual changes are allowed if there are dislikes. A  selection of  appetisers came in succession, followed by a superbly fresh fish course, melt in the mouth oxtail as the main course, desert and a planchette of petit fours. The service was faultless - neither rushed nor slow. They have an incredible wine selection and we accepted their recommendation and had a terrific Rioja which was also sensibly priced. Absolutely faultless cooking, each mouthful was a joy to experience. Jesus Sanchez is a chef who shows great skill using local ingredients to ensure that all his dishes work well together. A truly memorable dinner - absolute perfection.","1","","FAMILY","2014-05-31","2014-05-04","2014-05-04","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r204030173-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

We had the cheapest menu, which still consisted of 6 courses.  All the food was beautifully presented, ""Masterchef"" style, and the dishes were innovative and elegant, but using local produce.  The staff were so attentive, but not in your face, and the way the restaurant is laid out, you don't feel over-looked or heard by other diners.  It was a real highlight to our holiday, especially as it's so off the beaten track.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/c5/a9/de/cenador-de-amos.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Fabulous","What a fantastic experience. The food was excellent, innovative and beautifully presented. They used local seasonal produce and made it all taste exquisite.  The staff could't have been more helpful, especially as our Spanish was not that good, even bringing over to the table an English chef from the kitchen - who incidentally told us what a pleasure it was to work in the kitchens there. The service was attentive without being too much in your face. The atmosphere was calm, professional and friendly, with high quality table linens.

We would have gone again, but unfortunately they were fully booked for the one day we could have gone. I highly recommend this restaurant. Go if you are in the area.","2","","NONE","2011-09-30","2011-11-10","2011-11-10","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r120415635-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"

Atmosphere: 1","The beret has been raised to the palate","I hadn’t been to Marbella bars for years and being from Santander I recognize that it made me evoke those feelings of places where chaos, haste, bad education and bland food reign.  A freshly captured anchovy quality pit sold as if it were the last liter of oil there will be in 100 years. An outdated service that can keep you waiting between dishes for more than 30 minutes. It is especially serious when they make one day after another the same menu for the whole world as chain of production of cocacola in Galdakano. Maybe some bartender slave had a cramp or the arrogance of service for saying we are local Santander produced an irreparable dislike. Feeling rejected in a 300 site for a beard is a feeling that cannot be explained. I think the priority should be to make yourself comfortable with the deal, not to accommodate the chair when you come back from the bathroom. It seemed that they had the strava installed by how they ran back and forth like headless chicken, chick stingers as they forced us to accept that they are called in Cantabria. I sincerely believe that the lack of the usual Mexican sommelier has produced a disintegration in the sanchineta. When he came to receive from us both ears the tail and the exit through the big door he refused to tell him that after 6 excellent times he was surprised with this drop in level only worried about the stab by tripavisor. Well, here's Jesus. He wanted to make up for his affront with a few pieces of hard bread.","2","","FRIENDS","2024-07-31","2024-10-11","2024-10-11","en","Cenador de Amós","1752010","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r973526199-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html"
