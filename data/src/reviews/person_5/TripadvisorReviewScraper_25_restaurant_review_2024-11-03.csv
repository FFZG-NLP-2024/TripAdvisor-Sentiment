We were there Oct. 20, 2024, for a special family occasion.   We were not offered anything for our inconvenience.  My bison dish of our 8 course dinner was not edible.   On the positive side, the table service was what I expected of a Michelin Star restaurant.    Food presentation was as expected.  Table management needs to improve.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r976868264-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

So why not a 5 overall, because for the price and the Michelin Star one doesn’t expect them to forget to deliver a course. Got home, looked at the printed menu they gave us of our meal and  realized one of the dessert courses ( Mignardise) was never plated for our table of 3. And, if you go on their website both places where you click to get in touch are inoperative. So this is the only place I can provide feedback. Which is a poor way to end such an excellent meal and certainly cheapens the value-for-money.

As to the food, WOW!!  The fresh, unique, flavorful, and creative dishes were world class. In the dozens and dozens of Michelin starred restaurants I’ve been to I’ve never had a tartare course, wagyu course or scallop course that tasty and unique. Bravo!!

The wine and non-alcoholic beverages were also superstars of the dining experience. Each wine certainly enhanced the food courses. Our designated driver’s non-alcoholic pairings were the envy of the table. SUPERB!

The wait staff was always professional, friendly and attentive. And the welcome and send off from the chefs as we passed the kitchen was a nice touch.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/0b/3e/1f/caption.jpg

Food: 5","I must have died recently and, somehow, wound up in Heaven.","Oh, my. We ate at Tavernetta and concluded that it couldn't get much better. WRONG! The Wolf's Tailor is A M A Z I N G. We selected the five-course ""Entrust"" menu. Each course was astoundingly good. I'm sure each course had a name of some kind, but neither my wife nor I can remember what. What we can remember is the description of each dish. Complex? Oh my, yes. And many of the ingredients are provided by a certified forager. The first course, as an example, was almost inedible. Why? The dish looked so beautiful, it was truly a work of culinary art. Eat it? I didn't even want to disturb it! But I did and, no surprise, the tastes were gorgeous. The tab for this glorious menu was $110 per person plus the 22% service fee. Realistically, given what one has to pay for feed-lot beef and poorly cooked vegetables in a steakhouse, $110 per person is a bargain. Actually, given the venue, food, and service, it's a HUGE bargain. Reserve early. It's sold out just about every night.

A great experience but our pocketbook certainly won’t permit a second experience.
Besides the hefty tab (there is no menu and we had no idea of the cost; we should have asked and they should have told us), it was very cold in the restaurant. Several customers wore there jackets. My wife and I used ours to keep our legs warm. They offered blankets, which indicated they knew it was cold.","0","","NONE","2023-01-31","2023-02-01","2023-01-31","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r877055947-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

Food: 5","Amazing Gourmet Experience","What a wonderful dining experience! The tasting menu we experienced was the buckwheat theme, and it was exquisite. Taste, presentation, and innovation were out of this world. There are 7 courses and we left full but not miserably stuffed. The first course was small bites including a buckwheat donut topped with caviar and a sauce that was out of this world. I had venison that was so tender it would melt in your mouth, made-from-scratch soba noodles, buckwheat flatbread with a duck liver pate topping, and amazing desserts. I hate fish and seafood, but I wanted to be adventurous, and I'm so glad I was. There were two courses with fish, and I gobbled them up. All of their ingredients are sourced locally.

Service was fantastic--attentive, thoroughly explained each course, made great drink recommendations to pair with the courses.

Well worth the expense for a special occasion and major foodies.","0","","NONE","2023-01-31","2023-01-05","2023-01-05","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r874026800-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

Service: 5","Fantastic overall","We absolutely loved the experience, food, and the wait staff.  I chose this spot for my wife's birthday dinner, and I stated that on our reservation. The female Somalia was incredible, concise, knowledgeable, and beyond professional. Exactly the caliber of staff I would expect from a ""culinary experience"" 

The start to the night was not ideal, the male waiter we had was very nice, professional, and on top of it. For the start of the experience though, I would say they need more training.

I pre-purchased our dinner, and drinks. When he approached us, he asked if we had been there before. We answered no, and he began running through how the ordering experience is and such, I cut in and explained I ordered everything ahead of time. I was surprised that he was not aware of that before coming to the table, 

(I would recommend recording that information and adding it to the reservation to improve the experience for the customer, or make that apart of your spiel)

After the first interaction 

He came back with our water and stated ""oh yes you did, would you like to put those drinks in?"" which added to our confusion. I asked him ""I paid for the mixed drinks and food ahead of time, I thought this was all paired together for the taste"" His response was ""oh you can put in something else too, and your other drinks will come out once we get started"" 

Naturally I asked, when do we get started? He responded ""whenever you are ready"" 

At this point I was a little frustrated as there was a lack of ""setting the stage"" and small details were being left out. 

I asked for a proper overview, felt better after that, but the impression was made. 

At this point I was hopeful it would get better, and the rest of the experience? Incredible. The male waiter from here was on top of EVERYTHING, didn’t miss a single beat. The others were all very knowledgeable and helpful. 

The final dish was the dessert, we personally did not like it very much but it was interesting. I would have preferred to swap #7 with #5 as #5 (if I'm remembering the number right) would have made a savory finish, but who cares what I think and it was all incredible. 

My wife and I are not big holiday and birthday people, we like to celebrate quietly with one another and we really appreciate that the staff did not make a big deal out of it as I forgot to leave a note to keep it a quiet affair.  Really appreciate the candle and no singing!  

The ambiance: 
I chose the patio/garden as I thought it would be the coolest/cutest. It was not what I expected, I expected a quieter more romantic setting.  To set the stage, you have to enter through the patio/garden instead of the front door. The garden area has fresh herbs they are growing that are actively used in the meals. Which is awesome! However because you need to enter through here, people are constantly coming and going. There are some tents for some privacy, but we did not get one and sat next to some people that were pleasant enough, but a little loud and played stuff over their phones a couple times. It was unfortunately distracting. 

The way I read about Wolfs Tailor was a romantic culinary experience, and it is beyond a doubt a wonderful experience, however I will say if you're expecting a romantic couples dinner for a one on one like experience, you and your partner will just have to be the people that block others out. We did and had a great time, I just wish the experience was more so nurtured 

Also the speaker above one of the tables was too loud, they were happy to turn it down, but one of those things. I also found that the music was poorly chosen for the ambiance, too loud and aggressive.  It was rhythmic and interesting, but not the right setting. For example I personally love metal music, but I wouldn't play it at a house party as it's not the right setting. 

I would say overall it’s a 8/10 experience that had some detractors, the staff, food, and drinks all made it worth it.

Final take aways and .02c 

Instruct your staff to set the stage for the experience better
Softer music choice, less volume on that speaker as it kept my ears ringing for the night
Garden seating could be a bit darker, or create more seclusion","2","","NONE","2022-09-30","2022-09-08","2022-09-08","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r859117015-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

Food: 5","Excellent on every level","Celebrating a wedding anniversary, a birthday, and a visit from family members all rolled into one spectacular night.

We did the entrust tasting menu with wine pairings. I didn't think anything could top the bento box but all seven courses were equally spectacular. Of the wine pairings, I only disliked one wine (everyone else loved it). I even liked the chardonnay - perfectly paired with the amazing pasta and homemade bread - and I don't normally like chardonnay. 

Service was top-notch from the moment we walked in. I loved how we got a short discussion about the food and wine with each course. 

We left informed, spoiled, the exact right amount of tipsy (but not me as the DD!), full but not overly so, and happy as two clams at high tide. 

We packed a lot of events and food in while my foodie B and S-In-L were in town, and this was the highlight of the week for us all.  Photos are subpar and we were so excited to dive into every new plate that we forgot a few. 

Well worth the cost for the extra happiness on my family's faces. Thanks to all at Wolf's Tailor for a great experience.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/a6/11/a0/delicious-but-my-least.jpg

Food: 5","The best food and service we had in Denver!","How might a wolf choose to dress himself, given the opportunity? A tuxedo to hide his ferocity? Perhaps that’s the very idea at The Wolf’s Tailor. An unassuming look to hide Denver’s finest meal. 

We were in town celebrating a very special occasion called life. We arrived at dusk and walked to the back of the restaurant, passing greenhouses and gardens. We checked-in and began a well-choreographed procession. Things flowed at The Wolf’s Tailor: time, food, alcohol, and happiness. We started off with whiskey highballs. They were light and fresh and made with a Suntory sparkling water machine. A whiskey cocktail that’s astonishingly refreshing. Tell me the last time you had one of those. Seriously, tell me about it. I’d love to try it because this one was delightful.

One of us got the wine pairing, while the other got the cocktail pairing. It’s hard not to make this review a Shakespear novel, so I’ll just say the drinks were phenomenal. A drink I still daydream about had green chartreuse, cold pressed pineapple juice syrup, and more of that Suntory sparkling water I keep hearing so much about. Highlights from the omakase were the roast chicken meatballs (pure Roy Choi!), the huckleberries fermented in sake for 7 days (what happens after 7 days? No one knows!), and the everything bagel naan (you read that right!). 

Skewered spot prawns would have stolen the show if not for halibut served in a lime, citrus broth that resembled pho with fresh dill atop. The halibut may have been poached for all I know. Good grief, let me come back and try it again please! My tuxedo hid nothing. I drank the broth like a savage because it was too pleasing to let go. I ate the rest of my partner’s halibut and drank their broth after mine. I had become the wolf. 

Somewhere amid this dizzying comfort of taste and fullness, we had homemade rigatoni made from house milled grains, and a buffalo tartare that deserves its own essay, and somewhere after all that I believe I ate a deconstructed dessert after a constructed dessert. Dessert after dessert. We’d gone too far to stop. We can never stop.","2","","NONE","2021-08-31","2021-09-15","2021-09-15","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r810164932-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

Food: 5","The tasting menu is great","I had the tasting menu and wine pairing. The portions are smaller, but I wouldn't have wanted any more for each course as I was struggling to finish by the end (and I have a big appetite). Out of the tasting menu the pasta course was my least favorite, but I'm not a big pasta fan, but that in no way meant it was bad. I really enjoyed the Asian inspired dishes. Good sake pairing. The ambiance is great  - there's a year-round outdoor fire pit out front that is a nice gathering place even in winter time. Had a great server that was the appropriate amount of attentive. The restaurant was full, but not overly noisy or cramped. I enjoyed the light touches of molecular gastronomy throughout the meal - I'm a nerd for this stuff. Will be going back again for special date nights.","1","","NONE","2019-11-30","2020-03-11","2020-03-11","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r750448704-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

We loved the pickles, and liked the pastas, quite salty and we rarely say a little less salt would be better.....so know before you go. As a hot new place, reservations are tight. There is no traditional bar, so we went for a drink across the street (just south) for one before dinner.","1","","NONE","2019-11-30","2019-11-16","2019-11-16","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r726800205-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

Abundant staff was very professional but not very warm. Having a couple food sensitivities eliminated almost the entire menu. We were asked if we had food sensitivities and then on finding out that gluten and dairy we're not possible for us, our waiter and the chef literally xed off almost every item on the menu. There seemed to be no interest in helping us figure out an option. That left a very sparse salad and a large bill. We came home and made a much better dinner for ourselves.","0","","FRIENDS","2019-11-30","2019-11-01","2019-11-01","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r723055348-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

We are from out of town and love experiencing those restaurants in other cities. This one did not disappoint. There were 5 of us and we decided to have the Entrust dinner. Wow. First it is the very best way to dine here. You will get off menu items and every course is more fun than the last. The wait staff described each item to a tee and they were friendly and appeared to really enjoy their jobs. The pasta we had was the hit of the night for us but also the desserts blew us away. (And we were stuffed by that time but ate them anyway.) Highly recommend the Entrust dinner. One of the most fun dinners the 5 of us have had.

I don’t even remember all the items we had via the tasting menu but they were all spectacular.  The avocado with a wine reduction thing was great.  As was the scallop dish.  The ribs were probably my favorite.  There was a custard thing that was good although way different than anything I’ve had before.  Pickles were great too.  Wine list was nice.  Lots of old world stuff which I love.  Service was the best part.  Maya was incredible.  I wish we had time to talk more.  She was super friendly and attentive with a great sense of humor and just all around fun.  Looking forward to returning.","0","","FRIENDS","2019-04-30","2019-04-22","2019-04-22","en","The Wolf’s Tailor","15851112","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r668481351-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html"

So many over the top dining experiences popping up around Denver!  It’s about time and great to see our citizens enjoying more than tacos burritos and green chili.   Get tut chef tasting menu. Well worth it and the cocktail and wine list are perfect pairings.  Hospitality is above average.  Everyone is smiling informative and show genuine care
