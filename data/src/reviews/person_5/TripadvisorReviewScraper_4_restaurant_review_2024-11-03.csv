Excelllent food and wine choices. The host made us feel right at home with a warmth and genteel nature as he explained the menu and his wife, the chef, made a simple off-menu pasta dish for our girls.

They are passionate about food and people and made our experience unforgettable, showing us photos of their grandfather and parents and treating us like friends. Such a special meal and memorable time!","0","","FAMILY","2018-06-30","2018-06-19","2018-06-19","en","Trattoria La Rosa 1908","1891598","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1787085-d1891598-r588874746-Trattoria_La_Rosa_1908-Sant_Agostino_Province_of_Ferrara_Emilia_Romagna.html"

All my guests were raving about the food. The aperitivi spread was incredible and the dinner was even better. Having tasted most of the (extensive and thoughtful) menu in April at the Trattoria in Sant'Agostino, I knew everyone was in for a treat, and they did not disappoint. Mattia was also extremely accommodating with respect to our requirements and helping us sort out the bar service. They drove two hours north for our event, and cooked in an outdoor gazebo. None of that affected the quality of the food or the service. Bravo. I will definitely re-visit the Trattoria on our next trip to Italy. It is a charming family-run establishment, a place where you can feel and taste the love that has gone into the business .","3","","FRIENDS","2012-09-30","2012-09-15","2012-09-15","en","Trattoria La Rosa 1908","1891598","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1787085-d1891598-r140332366-Trattoria_La_Rosa_1908-Sant_Agostino_Province_of_Ferrara_Emilia_Romagna.html"

Vintage place but very well kept and clean, staff and owner are exquisite people.
We decided on the truffle tasting menu, and the choice was excellent. 2 starters, 2 first courses, a second course and a dessert of your choice from the menu. Finally a truffle that smells and tastes, obviously thrown onto the plate at the moment. The exceptional first courses, tagliolini with butter and truffle, and the passatelli with truffle always extraordinary. Very good cutlet, in its simplicity it was tender, tasty and obviously with fresh truffle. Freshly made dessert (hot zabaglione with biscuits) and sublime tagliatelle cake. Wine pairing indicated by the staff and we were happy to have relied on their experience. I recommend going there, with reservation. We will definitely be back. Congratulations to all","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/0a/2c/45/caption.jpg
