Fascinating characters from front of house to pan bash.  Pure theatre. A masterclass. Kudos to Chef Ian AKA Aslan - the real Fir King. The magic apple birthday cake was extraordinary. And to Bob and Vanessa - for virtuoso wine parings. Santé. Proost!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f6/eb/fc/caption.jpg

Great to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. Then served by the chefs who explain each. Nice to hear how much of the ingredients they produce themselves and source locally. 
Good to see British wine in the list.
All I can add; gin with pine is amazing, selection of nice whiskies, lovely self catering cabins by Hygge at Vallum nearby.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r976687489-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

Saturday is the only lunch service they offer. Located in an airy upstairs space in a converted barn with 8 or so tables facing an open kitchen where 5 chefs worked away. The tasting menu comprises something like 18 courses; many of which are single bite expediences, Each course was served by one of the chefs team explaining the ingredients  and techniques behind it. They were all very friendly and approachable an we had some extended conversations about a range of topics. The food is very clever, original and inventive as well as being tasty and enjoyable. All in all a great experience with a very committed and passionate brigade seeking to create new flavours in the wilds of Northumberland. A lot of produce comes from the kitchen garden and two polytunnels with produce grown and selected by the chefs themselves. very friendly and efficient waiting staff. We were there for 3 hours 20 minutes and the food is very well paced. Overall one of our best ever dining experiences and delivered whilst the chef patron was away.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-16","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r974132396-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Just Wonderful","Visited Restaurant Pine to celebrate Tim’s 60th birthday as a couple. 
The meal at Restaurant Pine was as perfect as we had hoped it would be. Such a magical experience. Granted, you have to be a foodie and perhaps watch Master Chef on repeat to appreciate the creativity, expertise and talent involved in each impeccable course. The photographs and each title of the over 18 item course menu does not do the food justice but please have a gander. Every morsel was filled with expertly sourced flavour - sometimes unusual and, most of the time, foraged from the local environment. I couldn’t keep up with the amount of wild plants that  were included. Even the menu can be planted in the garden to release the wild flower seeds within. 
Here are photos of BBQ Shiso and Sugar Kelp - you  have to put the whole think in your mouth and it just bursts with flavour; Berwick Edge, Dry Aged Carrot and Horseradish - same pop in mouth technique and the carrot has the texture of meat. It has taken months to prepare; Asparagus, Sunflower and Sorrell - first of the season and gorgeous - caramelised sunflower seeds on a bed of miso cream with sorrell leaves.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/75/c3/52/caption.jpg

From the moment we entered the front of house staff were attentive, amazingly knowledgeable and so friendly. We had a lovely non alcoholic cocktail in the bar. They continued to provide an amazing service throughout, checking in about drinks, topping up water and chatting about drinks and wines on offer. 

The restaurant itself is in beautiful Northumberland and from the restaurant you have countryside views all around. 

The kitchen is open and it was a privilege to watch the chef team prepare the incredible menu. The precision and skill on display was amazing. 

The food was delicious, mostly local providers or from the garden kitchen or the wilds of Northumberland. Each course was well thought out and surprising flavours and textures! Every course was brought out by the chefs who explained what it all was! 

From start to finish this was a dream night. Wonderful staff, amazing food, well chosen wines and cocktails (alcoholic and none alcoholic!), beautiful venue. 

What a memorable evening!

My companion, being an avid follower of the Great British Menu and Cal Byerley, was overjoyed to discover this restaurant was so close to where we were staying one night and insisted on taking me to experience some top quality fine dining. I must admit I was initially reluctant due to the price. However, I was completely blown away by the whole experience. We were met at the door by a friendly lady and spent a pleasant time in the cozy bar where the Sommelier helped us choose some wine. All very laid back and relaxed and no one seemed perturbed by me wearing my (clean) walking gear. The restaurant is a good size for the small number of tables which are well spaced out with the open kitchen in the corner. It was fascinating to watch the chefs creating each dish, sometimes it seemed like a ballet was taking place in the kitchen. Each dish was introduced and explained in detail as it was delivered to the table. This was my first experience of a tasting menu and I must say that every dish was fantastic. The presentation, flavour and texture of the food was incredible. Even the bread and butter were the best I have ever tasted. Many of the dishes were an interpretation of something familiar but in an original and unique way, providing some real insight into what food can be like. I was certainly impressed. The atmosphere in the restaurant remained relaxed throughout with attentive but not intrusive front of house staff. Overall, a wonderful experience.","0","","FAMILY","2024-06-30","2024-07-17","2024-07-17","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r959914478-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

I can confirm the food was out of this world, flavoursome, unique and very enjoyable. The wine pairing I had has to be one of my very favourites I’ve ever had, the knowledge and enjoyment I got from the wonderful Vanessa was second to none. She really knows her stuff. 

All of the team were very friendly and you could tell how relaxed all guests are, all created by the brilliant team.

We wanted to know more about Restaurant Pine because we were  inspired by their approach to producing great food. We wanted to have the whole experience so included wine pairing and we were not disappointed. 
Pine was a treat for my birthday and from start to finish the experience was  without doubt a memorable experience.  Previous positive reviews discuss the quality, presentation and ambiance and we concur with their views. Its such a relaxed, friendly place that you feel so much at home. 
We had our favourite courses, including, Wild Sea Trout, Dried Aged Carrot & Horseradish, King Edwards Potato, Sour Dough Bread, Beetroot, Doddington Cheddar & Walnut , etc. Maybe I just say what my least favourite tastes were. So you are probably getting the impression it was a fantastic menu. However, least favourite is just based on personal taste. 
I think what really enhanced our experience was our wine sommelier's. They explained the reasoning behind the choice of wine, history and location. We know a little bit about wine, but we learnt so much. 
We sat at the chef table and had a lovely opportunity to watch the team prepare the the courses. They are so organised and it was a pleasure to watch. I would love to have them on Christmas Day. 
The icing on the cake was the lovely birthday card signed by all the team and Peach Cake which was a lovely gift for my birthday. The experience in terms of value for money is subjective. We felt it was great value for money based on the in-depth preparation of the ingredients to support the each individual course . We will visit again next year. Thank you to the whole team. It was lovely.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-27","2024-06-27","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r956953412-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

It is hidden in a farm industrial complex 8 miles from Newcastle on Hadrians wall , not a normal spot for a top end eating establishment ….but without any shadow of a doubt this is top end in terms of imaginative , clever , often brilliant cooking .

You are taken on a journey of sustainable ingredients throughout the menu which never stops giving in terms of bursts of flavour …….with lots of surprises . 

Simple ingredients,  locally sourced can produce extraordinary dishes …..the bbq bream , the King Edward potato dish , the Hogget broth , the Scallop dish the honeycomb desert all totally fantastic and I could mention many more things I loved .

But a good eating place needs a good vibe and a great atmosphere and the team at Pine are a great bunch of people , a great team led by Sian and Cal ……..but the rest of the team all play there part everyone showing great knowledge and all the food and wine and very friendly and welcoming . 

I could go on but I cannot really explain it all , you must go there experience for yourself but do not book every table because I need to go back again .","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-06","2024-04-06","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r945550894-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

Loved the inclusivity of the kitchen to table. Each dish was brought out by a different member of staff. What a really great idea. 
Also really enjoyed watching the food being prepared. Every dish was innovative and mouth-wateringly delicious.
Hard to pick a favourite however if pushed I’d say the parsnip, verbena caramel and honey and the beetroot, cheddar and walnut - both outstanding.
Friendly and relaxed atmosphere with hard working, attentive staff.

We arrived on a cool, damp, miserable March evening to be warmly welcomed in the parking area by a charming young lady who escorted us to a delightful cosy lounge.  Vanessa, the Sommelier, guided us through the eclectic drinks selection. I particularly enjoyed a pre dinner local wheat beer. Throughout the meal, at Vanessa's suggestion, I enjoyed some quite tasty and unusual reds from Turkey and Greece.  My wife enjoyed an Austrian Gruner Veltliner and a white Pinot Noir from Surrey.

In the dinning area we were seated directly in front of the open plan kitchen where we were able to observe the creation of our extensive culinary adventure.  We were close enough in fact for the two chefs (Ian and colleague) to present and describe each dish at our table.  We've lost count of how many wonderful courses we had, but our favourites, in no particular order, were Pork Chump with Salsify; Snow Ball Turnip; Potato with Cucumber Concentrate and Scallop with Cauliflower and Pear.  The 'piece de resistance' however was the Hogget which we were able to observe the chef nurturing throughout the first half of our meal.

In conclusion, an outstanding experience spread over three hours.  We look forward to our next visit.

This restaurant has been on our list for a while.
What can be said about this modern venue on a farm?
Well, it's multi award winning.

The dining option is a tasting menu of dreams.
Menus are reconstituted to make paper and are sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring.
All dishes are prepared and served from an open kitchen.
We were lucky enough to have a table right in front of all the action.

Service starts with some of the most-mouth watering snacks after snacks before you even get to the bread course.
Then comes the Pork Jowl, Celeriac & Preserved Berries,Pork Bone Broth & Hen of the Woods.
OMG,we're not even halfway yet.
The fish course was a delightful Monkfish, White Asparagus & Sunflower.
The main course was Roe-Deer, Larch. Black Garlic & Gooseberry.
Followed by desserts.

The evening doesn't stop there.
You are invited into the bar where you can order after dinner drinks and served a trio of sweet treats.
Pace of service was very slick and well orchestrated, which lasted no longer than three hours.
Yes,it's fine dining on a very high level on a farm and an experience that will be memorable for a long time.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/5e/f0/8e/caption.jpg

The restaurant and bar are beautifully crafted. 

The agricultural roots of this old barn are still evident, but not negatively so. The dining room is bright, airy and spacious thanks to a vaulted ceiling high overhead, and pride of place is given to the open kitchen, where chefs busy themselves carefully tweezering dishes. 
It’s clear that this is a restaurant that cares about the smallest things. Even the menus are a work of art - old menus are reconstituted to make paper for new menus, and sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring.

The menu is clever in the sense there’s a gradual building of flavour and clear consideration of quantity and pacing. 
Service is charming, in a way that makes everything feel effortless and never too much trouble. From front to back. Every dish is explained in exquisite detail. We selected the wine pairing which was brilliantly presented with incredible enthusiasm by the sommelier Vanessa.  

In conclusion a very enjoyable evening, delicious food completed by some delightful wine pairings. 

Tip.  Don’t worry about securing a taxi for the homeward journey because the staff will take care of everything.","2","","FAMILY","2023-12-31","2024-01-02","2024-01-02","en","Restaurant Pine","23858771","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r932022783-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html"

So much detail and preparation was evident  with locally sourced  and home grown ingredients which had been dehydrated, fermented and prepared in some cases over months!  The flavours were in some cases just so intense with the beetroot, the charcuterie butternut and the extraordinary parsnip deserts a few of the many highpoints... the wine flight was indeed a flight of exploration  with Vanessa... Welsh wine...who knew? And the soft drink parings for those not drinking a great and again unusual list of really interesting and delightful flavours...

Finally with the open kitchen and the Great service with all the staff and chefs taking turns to talk through the drinks and food just a great experience....thanks to Sian ,Cal,Ian and Vanessa and the rest of your team.
