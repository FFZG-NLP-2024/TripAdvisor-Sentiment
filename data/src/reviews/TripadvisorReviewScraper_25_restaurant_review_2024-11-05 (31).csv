Atmosphere: 4","Not 3 Michelin Star Worthy: Great food. Service falls short.","I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.

First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.

Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.

Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.

I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses. This is yet another example of how service is lacking.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-26","2024-09-26","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r971450381-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

We had the Inspiration Menu ""Nature & Aroma"" by Marco Muller, which contained seven courses plus some amuses bouches. The encounters were special: anyone who wishes to know how a few drops of mulberry oil could transform the aroma, look and taste of a dish must come here (we felt nothing). Anyone wonders how a deep fried slice of ""algae"" could be made to look like a half-piece of an oyster shell (with much imagination) and possibly taste like one (we failed...) should make an effort to dine here. Anyone who longs to taste beef without the real sensation of meat (small dark pieces of something supposedly to be beef) ought to be confronted in The Rutz Weinbar & Restaurant. With the professionally restrained mark-up of a mere 130% of a red wine we ordered, we felt extremely honored to have undergone this ""experience"". All these (all the positives) sound too good to be true - if only they were true.","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-03-10","2024-03-09","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r941610722-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

Atmosphere: 1","Disappointing ","We had dinner here. My wife and I eat at Michelin restaurants occasionally and were really looking forward to this. Our table was at the ground level of the hotel, felt like a dark hotel lobby with simple furniture. We were placed at a table for four which made me feel the whole evening as if two guests were missing at our table. If I book for two, I want to sit at a table for two. 
For the entire dinner experience the dull elevator music was in an endless loop and the presentation of the food was the same. Every dish in a large plate with a tiny, tiny dish in the middle, all dishes accompanied by some extra sauce poured or crunch that was served with a lot of tamtam. 

All dishes came with unbelievably elaborate explanations, at some point I felt tempted to tell the waiters that I just want to eat my food and not listen to them. The portions were miniscule even for three star Michelin standards.
 The more explanations a dish needs, the less I trust it. Good food needs to speak for itself.   
 
The desserts should be the grand finale, when the kitchen pulls out all the stops to bring the meal to a grandiose  ending. Far away from that in our experience. 

Last but not least the wine menu: I find my way around any wine menu and dont need the help of the sommelier. But the Rutz wine menu doesnt even tell me if the wine is white or red (for appellations that produce both) I felt almost embarrassed to ask the sommelier. 
And when the bill came and I saw I was charged EUR 32 for a 0.1l glass of champagne, I left the place angry and will not return.

Indeed, the country seems to have taken the same direction as its northern European neighbours for several years, with on the one hand a modern and inventive cuisine and on the other a completely revisited traditional cuisine.

The restaurant itself is superb, as well as the terrace, on which we were seated. The wines and food were all extraordinary without exception, as they should be in any establishment of this range (and with these high prices, it must be said).

The service is smooth, professional but also very relaxed, just like in any Scandinavian restaurant and also as nice and friendly as are the inhabitants of Berlin. Special thanks to the sommelier for his excellent advices and to the waiter who gives a casual thumbs up to signify that he is happy with our praise of the food.

This was a great experience for us, but I would perhaps not recommend it to people who think high gastronomy should always be buttoned up to the neck with old fashioned and stiff waiters in suit.

We chose to have the eight course menu with the accompanying wine flight.  Things started pretty well with two or three really tasty and enjoyable amuse-bouche dishes.  Unfortunately, as the meal progressed we found ourselves increasingly disappointed by the standard of some of the dishes.  We also had a very distinct feeling that a number of the dishes were just far too oily. 

Normally, the selected wines that accompany each course have the function of enhancing and complementing the flavours of the dishes, however, it felt as though they had been selected to try to combat the oiliness of the dishes.  Before we came to the end of the meal, we both were beginning to feel the slightly ill effects of the greasy nature of the meal.

When I compare this experience with many other recent experiences of less well acclaimed restaurants, and some other one and two star restaurants, I found it both disappointing from a culinary and flavour experience and also poor value for money.

We dined as a family of 4, with my husband and two daughters (both 12). We absolutely loved this dinner - it was one of the best we've had in a long time, and we've eaten at numerous 3* Michelin restaurants all around the world. They are thoughtful about the flavor of each dish and how it all comes together, without being pretentious. We especially loved the carp, the Mangalitsa pork, the nonalcoholic juice pairings, and the local German wines. They take humble ingredients and make them magical via alchemy - every dish was spectacular in its flavor, and the portion sizes perfect - we were full without the overfull, bloated feeling at the end of the meal. We loved the local German elements they incorporated into the meal - most of the ingredients are from local farmers and producers, although they are not fanatical about this and the emphasis really is on quality and making the meal fantastic. Service was great - very friendly and thoughtful without being intrusive in any way. Very memorable and definitely would return for more dinners here!","0","","NONE","2022-10-31","2022-11-05","2022-11-05","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r867326578-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

We explained our flight got cancelled, and we wouldn’t make it on time and we told them 2 days in advance and they charged full price of dinner. This is absurd and terrible taste of service here.

Food: 4","Underwhelmed with this seemingly avant garde food.","The meal was exquisitely prepared with very unusual and cutting edge (?) techniques and ingredient. Beautiful presentation. The problem is, nothing tasted great.  Our part of 3 was quite disappointed. For certain audiences, perhaps this food is unique and worthwhile. Later that week we ate a Amador in Vienna and had the best meal of our lives. Though equally elegant and well-prepared, it was a bit more mainstream and delightful.

Also, the schtick at the restaurant was a bit pretentious and over the top, vs other great restaurants that were more fun.","1","","NONE","2022-08-31","2022-09-05","2022-09-05","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r858586916-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

Simple design and an open kitschen. Chairs more comfortable than they look. A relaxed atmosphere quite uncommon for top class restaurants but welcome. Service perfect and food really good and interesting. Exceptional wine list and really excellent option of wine pairing. Some extra options to the set menu at extra cost but well worth considering. In short a very rewarding dining experience. Expensive but still value for money.","1","","COUPLES","2021-09-30","2021-10-03","2021-10-02","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r812796759-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

And I was refused! As a reason was given that due to COVID they have had a hard time and don’t take single tables. Fully appreciate that COVID had a big impact. But find it a bit extreme to refuse single people now. Oh well, what to do.","5","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-07-15","2021-07-15","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r797268184-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"

All of the service staff were friendly and professional. The courses were very pleasing to the eye and a sensation on the palate. Several courses were served as two separate dishes. The sommelier remembered comments and altered the following wines accordlingly. We arrived at 6:30 pm and left after 11 pm. An amazing evening from start to finish. Definitely a luxury, but for a special occasion well worth it. Thank you so much!","3","","NONE","2020-09-30","2020-10-01","2020-10-01","en","Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar","718320","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r772642435-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html"
