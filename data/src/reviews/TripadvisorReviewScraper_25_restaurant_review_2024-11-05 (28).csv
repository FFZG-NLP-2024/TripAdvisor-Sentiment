Food: 1","A huge disappointment","I explain the reason for my vote: I am a fan of good cooking, I like to cook as a hobby, I love to try starred or otherwise good restaurants, especially to try unusual dishes, preparation methods that I would not be able to reproduce at home, inventiveness applied to cooking... in short, to amaze myself. I expect this especially if I am talking about a restaurant with three Michelin stars.
The first impression on arriving at Il Pescatore is excellent, an evocative location, a very friendly welcome from all the staff in the dining room (which will prove to be the only voice that lives up to the restaurant's name throughout the meal), and great attention to detail.
As I usually do in this type of venue, I chose the tasting menu to be taken on a journey chosen by the kitchen, on their signature dishes. The menu is boring, banal, with dishes that in most cases I have already seen and re-seen. There is never a flicker, a thrill, an emotion in either the presentation or the flavours. It is a restaurant that lives on the glories of the past and on self-aggrandisement (dishes conspicuously signed with the restaurant's name), offering cuisine that is not traditional, but old.
I conclude by saying that one of the courses was wrong, fish with completely the wrong cooking. I point this out and the reaction is certainly very composed and polite, I am offered a new course. The question is, can such an incident happen in a restaurant of this level? For me not. I also think that the episode should be taken into account when presenting the bill, which given the price (the one that is STELLAR), cannot have flaws in the meal.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/f2/21/24/dessert-2.jpg

In addition to the exquisite food and wine and the lovely, well-kept dining room, one can really feel the warmth of family tradition with which every aspect of the experience is imbued.

We had previously been refused entry at another Michelin-rated restaurant in Italy at 1.55pm, and so felt anxious about timing when we arrived. Sommelier Alberto Santini instantly soothed us by explaining there was no rush at all. We then had a wonderful meal with every dish executed perfectly. Antonio Sanitini stopped by at our table to chat several times. We ended our meal at 4.30pm (feeling guilty about the late timing) but were escorted out very graciously by Antonio, who waited patiently while we sorted out our GPS before pointing us in the right direction. Dal Pescatore more than deserves its three Michelin star rating: quite apart from creating fine dishes, the Santini family truly understands, and lives, the concept of hospitality.","2","","COUPLES","2018-07-31","2018-07-20","2018-07-20","en","Ristorante dal Pescatore Santini","799437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1238427-d799437-r597930698-Ristorante_dal_Pescatore_Santini-Canneto_sull_Oglio_Province_of_Mantua_Lombardy.html"

Food: 5","A gem in every way","It is difficult to decide which of Dal Pescatore's virtues to spotlight first:  the conception of the dishes, the execution, the welcome from the family, the service, the wine list, the warmth of the rooms.  Suffice to say there is perfection in every detail.  I think it starts with the fact that this is a family restaurant:  Nadia and her son, Giovanni, in the kitchen; Antonio and the younger son, Alberto, in the dining rooms.  There is a gentleness to Nadia that emerges immediately as you talk with her, and that is expressed in her food.  There is no artifice in what she and Giovanni prepare.  Each dish is pure, elegant, and refined.  Hard to name a favorite, but a few that spring to mind:  the pumpkin tortelli (a signature dish that is both subtle and complex in its perfect balance of flavors), the long cooked beef shoulder with Nebbilo sauce, the lobster terrine with caviar, grilled eel.  Antonio and Alberto run the dining room with warmth and professionalism.  In some ways, each one of the dining rooms have a Japanese flavor to them, as each has an intimate view on at least one wall of the garden.  Wine list is fabulous.  The only downside is that the restaurant is close to nowhere.  But that does not deter in the slightest pilgrimages by foodies who fill up the tables every night.","1","","BUSINESS","2018-04-30","2018-05-03","2018-05-03","en","Ristorante dal Pescatore Santini","799437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1238427-d799437-r577670237-Ristorante_dal_Pescatore_Santini-Canneto_sull_Oglio_Province_of_Mantua_Lombardy.html"

This is a stellar dining experience without the bells and whistles and arrogance exuded by other establishments who have reached the culinary pinnacle. Be prepared to dig deep because it is well worth it. The Santinis are simply magical.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/51/a9/95/photo0jpg.jpg

The food and service are in my top 5 experiences worldwide.  The Santini family is so warm and welcoming that you can't help but have a perpetual smile on your face.

The dining room is colorful, open, and intimate.  Service is outstanding.  Anticipation of needs, world class wine service, and obvious care in delivering a top notch dining experience were evident at lunch and dinner.

Food is outstanding.  We had the tasting meal for both lunch and dinner.  Classic local ingredients, flawless execution, artistry, and much love are evident from the kitchen.

Cannot say enough great things about this restaurant.  Worth the trip to this countryside paradise.","1","","FRIENDS","2016-11-30","2016-11-10","2016-11-10","en","Ristorante dal Pescatore Santini","799437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1238427-d799437-r436192110-Ristorante_dal_Pescatore_Santini-Canneto_sull_Oglio_Province_of_Mantua_Lombardy.html"

I would have never found or known about this place otherwise.  He mentioned to me that we would be dining in the country side and to dress more towards elegante than what I had on at that time jeans.   Being an American and living in the mid-west, fancy in the countryside is kind of an oxymoron.  

It took a little over an hour to get there from Milan and it is literally in the middle of nowhere as in farmland.  The building was probably a small house at some point and when waiters in black tie greeted us, it was a mind twist.  A fabulous one, as I started to feel I was about to experience something I may have only seen in a foreign film.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon an we started out with a glass of spumante on the veranda.  The grounds to this place are serene and lovely.  Part of the experience.

We ordered one of the 3 tasting meals.  Each dish was gorgeous in its presentation and delicious beyond words.  I don't call myself a foodie or a wine connoisseur though I am always in pursuit of both.  I am though an artist and a stimulation junkie and I judge based upon those qualities.  I like to be surprised in the sense that I think I am going to be tasting this but it turns out to be that.    These dishes and the spumante met those ideals.  Without doubt, this was the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant.

Now I would like to mention the service.  That too beat everything I had experienced up to this point.  Everything was beyond measure and perfectly timed!  

If you are traveling to Italy, especially if you are somewhere between Milan and Venice, I highly recommend this place.  We do have this kind of experience in the US.  It is something that one will treasure in their memories for a long time to come.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/04/cd/c1/dessert.jpg
