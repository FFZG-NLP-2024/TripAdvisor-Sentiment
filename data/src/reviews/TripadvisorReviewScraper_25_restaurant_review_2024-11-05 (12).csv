Regarding the restaurant…the amouse bouche..the starters…the visit in the kitchen ..superb..and luckily..here the language was NO problem at all..except the sommelier who we could not really understand
The food was delicious till one of us got a langustino which still had the intestine in it….that is really not nice. When we complained, the reaction was simply…oh yeah…no..I am sorry…or can I bring you a new one …we do expect more
Would we recommend the restaurant…actually no….","1","","FRIENDS","2023-03-31","2023-04-16","2023-04-16","en","L'air du temps","786401","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1756478-d786401-r886475450-L_air_du_temps-Eghezee_The_Ardennes_Wallonia.html"

The food was perfect.  The environment was top.  You start your culinary journey in a little salon, swing by the kitchen (were they actually make a little dish for you which you eat in the kitchen), and “end” in their dinning room. You have a marvelous view on the fields around the restaurant and sit in a room that is some quite that it made me over-emotional (I was actually crying when sitting at my table, my emotions went in all direction, I never had such an experience).

If I can make 2 remarks 😊
•	Why only 2 stars in Michelin?  They should have 3 stars! 
•	They are located in the French speaking part of Belgium.  I was MEGA surprised that everyone spoke Dutch (not perfectly but more than I would expect in Namur).  Just make sure that when you translate the menu from French to Dutch that you have it checked by someone that understand Dutch very well, and Google Translate is not always the best translator 😉 

Oh and did I already say that I LOVED IT!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/27/ac/bb/fd/a-room-with-a-view.jpg","NONE","2022-12-31","2023-01-05","2023-01-05","en","L'air du temps","786401","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1756478-d786401-r874029748-L_air_du_temps-Eghezee_The_Ardennes_Wallonia.html"

During the three hours that we were there, we experienced nothing but gastronomic delight. Six amuses, five courses, a playful dessert, some herbal candy from their garden and the bill was more forgiving than in some mediocre Michelin star restaurants. 

They tried their very best to serve us in Dutch, even though the restaurant is in the French speaking part of the country. My advice would be to assign Dutchspeaking  waiters to specific tables, so that the information about the dishes is crystal clear. We felt silly because we didn't understand everything, but it's our fault for not speaking French. And again, they did their utmost best.

The view during lunch is very interesting as you can see how delicately the flowers and herbs are being handpicked for the next mise en place. And we were lucky to be next to the kitchen which allowed us a peek into the Chef's headquarters.

Of the five main dishes, only the quail with the eel and foix gras was slightly underwhelming and felt somewhat out of place. I guess one of the playful chocolate lollypops was far too sweet, but then again they are lollypops.

I'm sure the clients would appreciate it if the chef showed his face at the end of the experience, but I understand that he is probably preoccupied with making sure that every bite is as perfect as the next.

My new favourite restaurant.

they definitely have resources.

It was his birthday so I made reservations. Food was very tasty. We had the 7 course (I think it was 7) dinner. Started out with some delicious amuses. The main (pigeon) was seriously the best pigeon I ever ate. The garden view was also perfect. Only minor criticism I have is that when you come there, you go to the first room to have some snacks. And there is only the option to have some champagne or other sparkling wine as a aperitif. It would be -for me- also good to order a bottle of wine and already start there. We already had a few rounds of food before we got our first glass of wine.","0","","COUPLES","2018-07-31","2018-07-20","2018-07-20","en","L'air du temps","786401","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1756478-d786401-r597801534-L_air_du_temps-Eghezee_The_Ardennes_Wallonia.html"

We opted for the package which included a tasting dinner and overnight stay. 
It was AMAZING. 
Everything: the property. The hotel. The restaurant. The service. The quality. 
Chef San Degeimbre goes literally out of his way to make you feel at home while away from home. He personally greets you upon arrival, comes visit several times during dinner and leads the way out once the meal is complete. 
Every dish served is a artwork. A triumph of tastes and colors. Everything that grows in the adjacent garden is used. 
It was an unforgettable experience which I consider fortunate enough to have lived. 
Highly recommended. 
Thank you!! ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/c2/9d/16/photo9jpg.jpg

Was actually very much looking forward to book a weekend stay with you.
