Atmosphere: 5","Extraordinary experience!  Flavours and techniques extremely interesting","A very unusual evening, very special. The cuisine reaches the highest level, extremely inventive and innovative, elaborate and varied, with excellent products, very well presented. All the tasting were exceptionel and the experience challenges traditional expectations, an extraordinary route highlighting the local marine wealth, since It is pretty much all from the sea, even the butter. It’s for people who like to try different things, curious and unprejudiced definitely not for those who want their food served in a traditional pairings.
The service was excellent, always kind and ready to interact with us especially when some sensations of strangeness emerged in our eyes, they given us the keys to experience different tastes and flavours.
Without no doubt Chef Angel Leon’s creativity and concept itself gave us a unique experience that we had never experienced elsewhere. Impressive!
All around reflect the visionary and avant-garde work of a very strong, creative and passionate Chef featured stunning architecture and an amazing wine cellar.
All 3 stars very well deserved.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/6d/8c/d5/caption.jpg

The initial amuse bouche were delicious, served in a separate room with multiple chefs  preparing them in front of you.
Moving on to the dining room the presentations continued at regular intervals. Whilst remarkably inventive and beautifully plated some of dishes did miss the mark. The Iberico ham style tuna belly was challenging and the seafood based desserts didn’t really work. Out of ease we took the (standard) wine pairing which was a mistake. Some of wines were delicious, but the unfiltered Jerez wines were not to our taste.
Overall an amazing experience but in this instance the food was more style over substance.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/7f/a2/85/caption.jpg

Food: 5","Memorable meal","A very pleasant meal all round, very special. 
The cuisine truly reaches the very highest level, extremely innovative. Everything is delicious, using excellent products, superbly presented. It is pretty much all from the sea, even the butter, cheese and desserts. Despite that, the food is very varied. Although I found the sea desserts less convincing.
In the accompanying Nec Plus Ultra option, all the wines were very good, generously served. More or less half Jerez ones, and half more classic from Spain and France.   
Outstanding service, and very nice dining room. No private car park, but ample public spaces are available.
It is hugely expensive, but it is fair value.  
On the other hand, one could criticize the cold temperatures: freezing cold dining room, serving the wines too cool to allow the their real quality to come through (but that is the custom in the area), and the cold dishes are really too cold (like the wines, preventing the taste to develop). Also the reception room where you are first served some tapas is rather unpleasant, a boring and uncomfortable waiting room. Still, all that does not detract from the great overall experience.

Food: 5","Interesting meal","I ate here by myself on July 20th 2022, the cost was £337 for the standard tasting menu and accompanying sherry wines.    

Their lunch is very early, I was the second sitting at 13.15, not very Spanish at all, but the meal will take several hours so you'll still finish late.    The first few small starters are served in a lounge within the property but away from the main dining room; time to relax and prepare or if like me, cool down after a brisk walk from my hotel!     You get  a couple of wines with these four dishes.     You are then accompanied into the restaurant which is in an old mill and given a brief tour and a charcoal grilled sardine on the way to your table.   

Alas, at low tide there is a bit of a smell from the estuary but this does not seem to pervade the actual dining area.

I do not want to comment on all the dishes; you will like some more than others but they are all interesting.   I only left one which was called Pieles  lacticas  or milky skins.    This seemed to be fish skin imitating the skin on a rice pudding!    Not my cup of tea at all!   Everything else was interesting as a food experience but I do ask myself why?    Camembert cheese is delicious so why would you want to make it from tuna testes; Iberian ham is wonderful so why serve one created from fish?    It's an experience rather than a meal.   

I liked the sherries served in the wine pairing except for one, that was substituted for another I had previously had and enjoyed.    Perhaps there should have been an alternative new wine substituted?

Service was excellent from start to finish.

Would I go again?   No.   Did I enjoy the experience?   Yes.   Did I like the food?   Generally yes and they succeeded in producing a uniformly high calibre tasting menu which is very difficult to do.

Favourite course?    A jellyfish concoction served on a glass jellyfish globe as one of the after dinner morsels.    Tasty with a mild stinging after effect.","1","","NONE","2022-07-31","2022-09-01","2022-09-01","en","Aponiente Ángel León","9881151","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r857860691-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html"

Aponiente is beautiful, an old mill turned restaurant the chef did an great job transforming this place to what we see today. The decor is perfectly inline with the theme of the sea. 

There is no other fine dining establishment I’ve been to that compares to this! Prior to being seated at your table you’ll have a seat in a comfortable waiting area where you’ll indulge in some of the best appetizers you’ll nibble on. From there you’ll go on a small tour of the restaurant/kitchen prior to being seated; you can see all of the chefs hard at work. 

The main dinning area is well lit, with cool drop ceilings and a view of the kitchen. The waiters are all in sync and well prepared when serving you the multiple main course meals throughout your dinning experience. The food is down right delicious and has so many amazing flavors. The fact that none of the dishes had any, beef, pork and chicken was impressive; it was all from the sea and magnificent. Another amazing thing was how much of the sea was used to make the delightful food, this restaurant is all about sustainability and things that would typically be thrown out from a fish were repurposed and used in the dishes. 

I highly recommend going to Aponiente if your ever in El Puerto de Santa Maria. You won’t be disappointed, worth every penny.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/08/72/c4/caption.jpg

And you'll not have a wine pairing to remember. After eating the whole menu including 3 of their breads, we were still left hungry.

The service is very rushed and on top of that it seems that they literally have to refill your wine glass 20 times per bottle. They will come to your table atleast 20 times to pour like 1-2cl of wine. Enough for a sip or two and then they need to re-fill again... 

The atmosphere is too noisy. There is simply too many tables for the space, which ruins the experience for many.

But why does a 3 star restaurant not have a wine pairing? Has sherry pairings instead? Dont you have a sommelier?

Had forgotten the level of attention to every little detail. Location bluntly odd - on an old abandoned industrial site next to the train station, not where you expect to find culinary heaven. .building actually an old water mill - driven by tidal movements. Apperativos  taken in an ante area before the main restaurant.  Moving to the restaurant a mini tour was given of the old building. Decoration very tasteful and well done. Food simply exquisite with each plate surpassing the previous. Vast majority of the plates based on local sea produce. Each well presented and incredibly tasty. Service impecable - discreet and informed.  As I was solo, I took the wine tasting option. Whilst the individual wines were great, the majority were Jerez based in one way or another and, in my opinion simply didn’t match with the food dishes - they didn’t compliment or contrast, they simply were. This was the only slight disappointment of the evening, especially given other wine tasting experiences which have gone phenomenal with the food, and I explained this to the sommelier.  However, this didn’t distract from the overall experience which was fantastic.  Highly recommended.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1d/4e/35/b6/caption.jpg

Impressive location, all makes perfect sense after having learnt about the origins and the philosophy of the chef and his project. All dishes are simply an achievement of creativity and innovation, perfect texture, excellent product, an explosion of marine tastes, all amazingly presented; difficult to choose which ranks the best!. Our child, 9, had a special menu, tasteful and easy, but was also given the chance to try a few portions of the principal menu, making it far more than a good dinner, living something really special. Our gratitude to all staff members for their warming attention and top profesionalism deployed throughout the experience, and congratulations to chef!! An unquestionable ""must"" for those who love gastronomy and seafood, when you visit Cadiz.","1","","FAMILY","2020-08-31","2020-08-16","2020-08-16","en","Aponiente Ángel León","9881151","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r765259928-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html"

Unlike other 3-star Michelin restaurants, the bottled mineral water, as well as the coffees were all complimentary... (no pun intended) leaves a nice taste in your mouth!

The setting is unique and the structure of the restaurant is lovely.  
We quite enjoyed our appetizers in the first building before going to the dining room.
We were seated at a table for 8 but there was only the 2 of us...very strange!  All the tables were large with white table cloths that just looked uninviting and cold.  The tables were far apart and the atmosphere truly lacked intimacy...candles, flowers etc would have been nice.
The food was good, but I think the presentations and theatrics of the staff was just a bit over the top.  
Some one mentioned feeling rushed.  I agree.  There was not much down time between courses to the point the ""wine server"" kept removing my unfinished glasses of wine/sherry.  This is unacceptable for the price.","7","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-12-14","2019-12-14","en","Aponiente Ángel León","9881151","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r732683427-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html"

Then, you receive a great welcome in an elegant room in which you are delighted with tasty and amazing texture appetizers.
After that, you are taken to the main restaurant where the maitre tells you about the building (a refurbished tidal mill) and accompanies you on a trip along the kitchen.

The furniture is simple and elegant, the atmosphere is very cosy and the waiters always seem to be in high spirits and they are really kind to the customers.

In my opinion, every dish is tasty, keeps a good balance of flavors, and you can appreciate the high quality of all the products.

Last but not least, they adapt all the dishes for people with coeliac disease and lactose intolerance without losing the essence.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/ef/e9/ea/restaurant.jpg

The place truly has a soul and a meaning with its focus on fresh, organic and sustainable sea food. We enjoyed the history, the stories about the food, the educational bits, the exceptional service and most of all the food of course. 

And yes, it’s really expensive for a Cadiz where you can often have an amazing dinner including a drink for 10-15 euros per person. This makes it challenging as the comparison is so completely out of balance. In London a good dinner is often 100 pounds per person and an exceptional 200 pounds which makes Aponiente great value.

To us it was well worth it but don’t set the expectations too high beforehand.","2","","COUPLES","2019-08-31","2019-08-17","2019-08-17","en","Aponiente Ángel León","9881151","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187434-d9881151-r700063517-Aponiente_Angel_Leon-El_Puerto_de_Santa_Maria_Costa_de_la_Luz_Andalucia.html"

Almost like a run down industrial estate.  You go in the restaurant buildings and it becomes a Demi-paradise!   
Service over the top good.  2 plus hours of being served with the most wonderful food and drink.  Very little to think about - a constant stream of wonderful stuff.  
Only around 17 diners so atmosphere not quite right.  Apparently it is packed at the weekend with around 40 diners per service. 
Whilst some dishes taste like meat, everything is sea food of some kind.  
The plates used were great works of imagination - occasional laugh out loud stuff.  
All the matching wines were sherries (maybe one of the 11 wasn’t). I loved them.  
The bill was steep but less than I feared. There were few of the add ons one is often stuck with.  €650 for 2 including plentiful booze.  It felt like value for money.  
A very special evening.  I would not necessarily rush back but I would heartily recommend it.
