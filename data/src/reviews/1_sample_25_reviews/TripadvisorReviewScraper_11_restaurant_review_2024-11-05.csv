It was remarkable.  Hearty yet refined, every attention to detail noted. The drink paring was also so creative with house made and unique juices and teas. I will be daydreaming about this meal for a long time.

Dish after dish followed, each a triumph and accompanied by a provenance story which testified to the philosophy of the restaurant.  When embarking on a 10+ tasting menu there is always a course just not to your taste, not here...even the courses you would not normally order were superb (e.g. tongue).  Even more impressive that the team delivered such a fantastic meal from a kitchen smaller than my own at home.  Can't recommend highly enough.","0","","COUPLES","2022-12-31","2022-12-01","2022-12-01","en","Stallen","19086260","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d19086260-r870341649-Stallen-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

The eatery is almost a bit secluded, but it is revealed that something good is in store when you are greeted by a fire pit. A fire pan that gives a good welcome with both smell and warmth. We were well received by the staff. We were also lucky when we got to sit closest to the open kitchen. This evening we were served a 16-course meal and we included a wine package to get the most out of it. And here we are talking fine dining of the highest class. We were taken on a culinary journey with local food. The sommelier had also done her part to find wine that went perfectly with the various dishes. The place is intimate. The chefs come out with the dishes and enthusiastically tell about each dish. And I would argue that each dish is almost a work of art. All the way down to the smallest detail.

In terms of price, this is not a place you go often. But here you pay for quality and experience. Set aside the whole evening, sit back and enjoy. We'll be back. We are absolutely sure of that. This is a gem!","0","","NONE","2021-11-30","2021-11-28","2021-11-28","en","Stallen","19086260","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d19086260-r820345569-Stallen-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

This place has it all. 

Great dishes with a lot of thought behind 'em. Building blocks of taste hitting your senses. Lavishly presented by chefs, sommeliers and waiters lining up with information pieces on all parts of the specific dish. Mushroom and vegetables from another dimension, truly fantastic reindeer and sweets that bring you back to summertime at your grandmother's cottage. 

Truly inspiring. We'll meet again.

The venue is very pleasant, few tables, high ceilings and absolutely no intrusive music. We sat right next to the small kitchen where the ""magic arts"" were performed; very fun to ""follow along"". The dishes (just under 15, with small and large) were served at a relaxed pace, by waiters (and chefs) who knew what was being served. No for granted everywhere, that!

The wine pairing was thoughtfully put together; 6 out of 7 wines I had never heard of, but all tasted excellent. I would like to object that the wine menu was in the most expensive tier (and the pour somewhat modest), but never mind, never mind - don't detract from that, certainly sensible! The dinner party had non-alcoholic pairings; here certain variants were more ""interesting"", so to speak. But these were also skillfully presented.

There were beautiful glasses throughout, as well as serving plates, chips etc. - lots of fun. And the food was consistently comparable to some of the best we have been served! In addition to the fact that the dishes were a feast for the eyes!

We are leaving the stable on the wish list for a return visit!","0","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-29","2024-02-29","en","Stallen","19086260","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d19086260-r940194073-Stallen-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"
