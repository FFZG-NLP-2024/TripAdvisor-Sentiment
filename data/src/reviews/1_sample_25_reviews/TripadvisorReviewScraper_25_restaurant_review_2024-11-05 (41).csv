We had dinner in the private room with the sommelier orchestrating our experience.  The meal was unique and spectacular.  Undoubtedly, will make every diner a turnip lover, and lover of all vegetables.  The duck was divine.  The potato focaccia was delicious.  We splurged further on the upgraded pairings, and did not regret one of the many yen spent on this once-in-a-lifetime dining extravaganza.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r976766459-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

The dishes blends classic French techniques with Japanese flavors, resulting in a light yet flavorful meal that never feels as heavy as traditional French cuisine. The progression of the courses was great and there was no let down dish. The staff was attentive and courteous but also delightfully engaging, making us feel truly welcomed with casual conversation throughout the night.

Atmosphere: 5","Lovely restaurant with nearly flawless wait staff and delicious but rather pricey meals.","The prawn was cooked to perfection; its natural sweetness was fully pronounced, and its taste blended in well with the pea puree. The fava bean was the one element of the recipe that I personally found to be extremely off-putting; otherwise, it seemed like a well-balanced dish. The meal got its name because of the way the small triangle ""sandwiches"" were arranged, like a domino effect. The dish's tastes were excellent; I found that the marriage of curry and pumpkin was rather tasty.","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-21","2024-07-20","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r960410127-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

The service was very slow, 3.5 hours is the default. despite having 4 very nice waiters servin our table, none of them appeared to see a problem with us waiting 20 or 30 minutes for the next course after being served a 2 inch appetizer. we wanted dinner, we're not celebrating a wonderful lifetime event... 

I liked the very stylish interior. 

I feel like at this restaurant they focus on the theatre and not food or comfort.","1","","FAMILY","2023-11-30","2023-11-30","2023-11-30","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r927990553-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

Atmosphere: 4","We wanted to love it :(","So, we really wanted to like this place. We booked it for our last night in Tokyo, and this was our first three-star Michelin restaurant experience. It was a mixed experience and overall a disappointment.

Service was overall excellent. The staff were very friendly and professional. The only weird part was at the end of our meal we felt abandoned. They had offered us hot beverages and we declined, saying we were very full and tired. After that we waited about 15-20 minutes for the bill, which didn't come, so I got up to see if we could pay at the front. When I got up someone did come over to escort me to the restroom, at which point I asked if we pay at the table or the front counter, and they brought the bill to the table a couple minutes later. They were very accommodating and called us a taxi which arrived just a few minutes later.

The ambience was really nice in the restaurant. The lighting was very intentional and the tables were spaced out so we felt like we had our own little corner of the restaurant.

The food was the biggest disappointment. Some dishes were better than others, but no dishes stood out as incredible. Most were forgettable, and a couple were just bad. There was a narrative/theme for the meal, but it got lost about halfway through.

We started off strong with crispy vegetables and dipping sauce--simple and tasty. The next dish was a pike conger eel risotto which was torched at the table, so that was fun and also tasted good--this was my fiance's favorite dish. My favorite dish was probably the salad, where they used 57 different vegetables/greens. I appreciated the story behind it and it was a fun experience to eat. They also brought cards that listed all the ingredients and where each was from. Most ingredients were from small farms across Japan. 

After the salad, the meal declined in quality and also lost the magic of the story they were trying to tell. There was a bread course. I love bread, so I was very excited for this. It was good, but not great. The focaccia rolls were served cold, and they were a bit dense. They served them out of the baking dish, so I'm not sure why they chose to serve them cold, but I think they would have been better fresh. The radish dish, which they keep on the menu at all times, was ok. The explanation behind the radish dish was that radishes naturally change flavor over seasons, so they encourage people to come back and try it again as the seasons change. It was nicely cooked.

The next dish was a fried small whole fish (ayu). We appreciated that this was an elevated take on a traditional Japanese dish. We were instructed to eat the head whole and then eat the body with the sauces. I'm not a big fan of eating crispy fried whole heads of things, but that's just me. The head reminded me a lot of botan ebi, but it wasn't very flavorful. Unsurprisingly, it was a little hard for me to eat, and I didn't love the fish guts throughout the fish either, but I understand that's just a personal preference and we were there to try new things. The sauces were just ok. I have a feeling the traditional grilled fish on a stick with sauce would have been more interesting and tastier than their elevated version.

The next dish, the main course, was by far the worst. It was duck, served rare, with a red wine sauce. The duck was very chewy and I got a tendon in mine that I couldn't chew through and had to decide whether to spit it into a napkin or politely swallow it. I chose the latter and it was gross. My fiance's cut didn't have tendons in it, but it was still chewy and he had a difficult time getting through it. The dish was served with a side of asparagus with cream sauce, which was very mild and forgettable. I've had rare duck with wine sauce before, and this was the worst version I've had, but also there was nothing interesting about this dish. It didn't fit the story of the meal, it wasn't creative, and it didn't taste good. Unfortunately, it was one of the bigger portions of the night also, so I ended up not being able to finish mine cause I started feeling nauseous trying to get through it.

The cheese course was nice. Tiny bits of cheese with sauce droplet pairings. It wasn't anything to write home about, but I love cheese so I appreciated that they included some.

The dessert was a couple courses and was uneven in quality. Some confections were better than others, but none wowed me, and some were just unbalanced and not good. The drink pairings for the dessert course also made the desserts taste worse. At one point we had a raspberry grapefruit drink, peanut milk drink, and matcha on the table all at once and the flavors were really jarring.

We could hear the couple next to us talking about their meal throughout the night, and they were not having a better time than us. When their duck dish came out we overheard the guy say to his wife, ""Should we just leave?""

With the non-alcoholic beverage pairings, our meal came out to almost $700, which is the most I've spent on a meal, and it was certainly not in the top 100 meals I've had. I don't understand why this restaurant has three Michelin stars, and it definitely made me less likely to try Michelin recommendations in the future. It's worth noting that they seem to have roughly doubled the price of their food in the past few years. If it had been half the cost, and we hadn't gone in expecting a three-star experience, I think we would have had a better time. However, as it was, it was quite disappointing. 

We still had a fun night, but mostly because it was a shared bonding experience of disappointment and trying to figure out how the food could be so mediocre yet highly acclaimed.

I am sure a lot of skill went into many of the dishes we were served, and I do think the chef/owner put thought and effort into the meal and experience. I'm not trying to question anyone's skill or talent, but the experience was not for us, and I would not recommend the restaurant given the relatively high cost.

Food: 5","Unforgettable & effervescent lunch with 2 friends ","I was lucky my friend was able to snag this lunch reservation for her birthday celebration in Tokyo/Kyoto :)  When my husband and I were visitors of Japan, we did try out another 2-star Michelin place in Tokyo...and it was regrettably very forgettable...and I won't name it or review it, which is why it has been 6 yrs since for Tokyo.  

Not L'Effervescence!  I was very impressed with the very creative and sophisticated non-alcoholic pairing option that my friend went for - the other friend and I did a split pairing with the wine. I also appreciated the sustainability approach, with local ingredients.  The turnip dish was so delicious.  I know this may not be a huge deal for others who like their meat rare, I'm usually a medium, and not a brave person with rare poultry... it was the first time one of my friends and I braved eating a medium rare duck - and it was delicious. Usually, I'm the one a bit embarrassed & disappointing the server and possibly the chefs when I cannot eat the rarer duck or squab that is brought out, but to my surprise, I took a bite and finished it - it was divine.

In terms of cost and value, I would say it's a fair price and great value.  I guess I am comparing it to 2 facilities in California, and with the wine pairing, the California counterparts were more expensive, and I would only recommend 1/2 in California. 

If this is your one splurge or one fine-dining French/Japanese restaurant, I would go with this.  Great ambiance, great staff and service, delicious, and the right amount of food.","0","","FRIENDS","2023-03-31","2023-07-02","2023-07-02","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r899869508-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

Choosing with French restaurant to patronize during our time in Tokyo was not easy since there are so many.  

We decided on L'Effervescence due to the reputation of Chef Shinobu-san, who opened the restaurant in 2010, in combining french cooking techniques with japanese flavours.    

The restaurant is located on a quiet street (I believe residential in nature) and the dining room has that calm, romantic, sophisticated modern feel to it.  The food is impeccably prepared and is delicious.  There is only tasting menu during the dinner service: Renaissance.  It is a 12-course meal comprised of ingredients that highlight all that Japan has to offer.  

The restaurant is renown for its Tokyo turnip which is cooked for 4 hours but we did not find it to be a compelling experience.  It was good but beyond that we couldn't understand why this is the flag-bearer for the restaurant.  

All courses were delicious; nothing disappointed us.  I opted to have the non-alcoholic fruit juice pairing.  I received 4 different home-made juices and while they are all delicious I would have preferred the pour to be larger.  Each pour was maybe 2 or 3 ounces, at best.  

Service was very good.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff made every attempt to speak English to us and it was very much appreciated.  

I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/fe/0c/a7/apple-pie-with-wild-boar.jpg

First tip ensure you go by taxi and give them the precise address as its in a hard to find location but definitely one worth seeking out. The sophisticated ambience as you enter the dinning room following your seat in the “waiting room” sets a high standard for the food to meet, it does and then some.  Quality of service is second to none and the tasting menu is a delight to behold, an example being the salad course which is a picture on your plate then to be told there are fifty different items on your plate and here is a list of the items. The menu is complemented by an extensive wine list. As you would expect it’s no cheap but as an experience it’s more than worth the money.","0","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-10-13","2019-10-13","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r718093727-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

We were treated to a Japanese tea ceremony and a special birthday dessert. The food was superb and the champagne the best I've ever tasted. We had fun with the waiter trying to explain to him that the dessert was toffee. Google Translate came to the rescue. For the first time ever I was escorted to the bathroom and the waiter apologised for it being occupied and directed me to their comfortable lounges to wait on. So courteous and customer friendly. When we reluctantly left, our waiter chased after us with two slices of cake. This is not an everyday restaurant as it's quite expensive but if ever I go to Japan again I'll be sure to invent an excuse to go back. Well done to all the staff here. It's a birthday I'll never forget.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/19/39/bc/ac/scallops-sashimi.jpg

Perfectly combining Japanese produce with french cooking techniques. We enjoyed the lunch, which was a great deal at 10k ¥. Scallop sashimi, Tokyo turnip, Ayu in a buckwheat crepe, summer venison with sea snail purée all where outstanding. Quite exciting for me the freeze dried and fried Ayu for me, but the best in taste was the venison with the umami of the sea snail purée, closely before the absolutely balanced scallops.
Just above almost every restaurant I was before was the impeccable service. Maybe we are not used to the incredible politeness of Japanese people right now at the beginning of our journey through Japan but this was truly world class. The wine is definitely on the the more adventurous side with lots of biodynamic or vin naturel producers on the list (especially from Japan). I took the special pairing and it was quite exciting.
We are 3 1/2 weeks in Japan and they figured out a way to squeeze us in at our last day (I know, crazy with the choices out there, but we liked it a lot).","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/da/e0/80/photo0jpg.jpg

The following; maybe too twee riff on a McDonald's apple pie parcel was a bit muddled and consequently less successful, though still tasty enough.
The following horse mackerel sashimi and noodle dish was a triumph and probably the best dish of the set.
The signature cooked turnip a real disappointment as it managed to be both watery, bland and with an unpleasant mouth feel. The parsley sauce didn't work as a counterpoint and the Basque ham was missing in action.
The whole fish and buckwheat pancake again a little clumsy and difficult to eat though had great flavours happening .
The following pork dish was terrific as was the fruit based dessert.
The tea ceremony finale also a nice touch.  Ingredients were first class and generally solid technique from the kitchen.   
A lack of really good English on the part of the staff (otherwise very professional and polished) made explanation of the dishes problematic, though the menu card helped. A stylish and elegant room with exceptional tableware. 
Small,high quality wine list weighted to high end offerings.... no bargains here, though the Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling was a great wine. 
We are huge fans of Japanese Chefs cooking in the French tradition.... built a trip to Paris around just that, so it was interesting to see what was being done locally by a Japanese Chef cooking more within his own tradition but within a European context.
While not completely successful it was a very good meal.","1","","COUPLES","2019-07-31","2019-07-09","2019-07-09","en","L'Effervescence","3650658","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r688259113-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html"

It is definitely a venue to celebrate special occasion. Unfortunately our dinner was a bit disappointing.

Service was attentive but the young man who served our table spoke English with a heavy Japanese accent. It was difficult for us to get what he was telling us about the dishes and we had to refer to the menu frequently. At Narisawa, everyone spoke perfect English and it greatly enhanced the dining experience.

They served only the Renaissance set menu and we did not find the food memorable. The salad was made with many kinds of vegetable prepared in different ways. They even presented a menu with the salad introducing the origin of the ingredients. The dish was similar to the signature salad we had at Den but it was not as delicious in taste nor as interesting in texture. We were told the 4 hours cooked turnip is the Chef’s signature dish. It reminded us the potato we had at Core by Clare Smyth in London not long ago. They both share the same concept of turning something simple into gourmet. Clare’s potato was out of this world and we could not have imagined a humble potato could be the star of the evening. On the other hand, the turnip was just a turnip and the flavour was underwhelming. We also did not find the apple pie #38 with prawn and goat cheese appealing. The cheese course with 3 tiny pieces of cheese was also poorly presented.

Some reviewers considered the tea ceremony pretentious but we must disagree. We enjoyed the performance and it was unique and a very nice ending to the dinner. ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/e5/17/2e/photo0jpg.jpg
