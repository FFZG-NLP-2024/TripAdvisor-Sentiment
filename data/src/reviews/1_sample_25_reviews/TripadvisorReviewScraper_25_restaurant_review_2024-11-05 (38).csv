Best I ever had.","Everything was outstanding!  I have been to other 3 michelin star restaurants before in different areas of the world. HISA FRANKO was more than perfect. Service was professional and ditealed. The food was beautiful and the best testing food I ever had. The wines were interesting( I choose the funky option, I had wines I never tried before). I had nothing to complain of and nothing to ask for, because they were ahead of the game every step of the diner during the entire night. Well done! 

I am gluten free and they serve me the best buckwheat beignet, tagliolini, and cappelletti I ever had before and after becoming sensitive to gluten. It was better than the once I have had with gluten when I was able to eat everything. 
I would like to return here perhaps in the spring.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/aa/67/ae/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-30","2024-09-30","en","HISA FRANKO","1059106","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r971992773-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html"

Atmosphere: 5","The food and service quality was truly exceptional, I can't wait to come back","I don’t usually write reviews like this, but Hisa Franko truly deserves it. A few years back, my wife became obsessed with Netflix, particularly the show Chef's Table. After watching the episode featuring ANA ROS, she was adamant: “Yes, let’s go to Slovenia!”   Unfortunately, we couldn’t secure a reservation at the restaurant, so we opted to stay in the heart of Kobarid. From the moment we arrived, we felt incredibly welcomed. It was like visiting family—warm and inviting, a feeling you never want to leave behind. The selection of aperitifs was outstanding, with thoughtfully crafted cocktails and non-alcoholic options made by the Hisa Franko team, along with local beers and Slovenian wines.  We dined in a cozy red room adorned with paintings, kombucha jars, and lovely carpets. It felt just like being in our own living room. The food was absolutely incredible, and the funky wine we tried was the best my wife and I have ever tasted. A huge thank you to Manuel, Tylen, Alejandro, and the rest of the team who made our evening so memorable.  At the end of our meal, we had the opportunity to tour the kitchen, guided by the wonderful Lisa, who shared insights about its layout and operations. We were also taken to the wine and cheese cellar—what a treat! They age their own cheeses there.  I can’t express enough gratitude to the entire Hisa Franko team. You made our time in Slovenia unforgettable and definitely worth a return visit, even though it’s not just around the corner.","0","","FAMILY","2024-05-31","2024-09-28","2024-09-28","en","HISA FRANKO","1059106","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r971760402-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html"

However, sadly, the dinner was badly marred by a rude and incompetent sommelier. With wine pairing at $170 /person, one would expect better. One of selections smelled strongly of sulfur—it should have been decanted in advance. Another was obviously corked & unfit to drink. Nevertheless, the sommelier refused to replace the glass with something else. It is unbelievable to me that a two star restaurant would allow a few ounces of wine to deminish a patron's experience! Unfortunately, this will always be foremost in my mind when I think of Hisa Franko.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-26","2024-09-26","en","HISA FRANKO","1059106","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r971468849-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Stone in my food cracked my tooth.  Their response was not adequate for a $600 meal.","First the good.  Ms Franko's food is extremely creative, mostly delicious and a wonderful journey through nature and all the flavor combinations you've never had.  Pretty much all the dishes were delicious - all 7 courses - though some were exceptional, most were flavors and combinations that were unfamiliar but unique and delicious. We had a tasting menu with which I had the ""Juicy"" pairing of homemade kombuchas, juices, and elixirs.  They were good with the food and definitely worth one try.

The bad?  There was a stone in my food that cracked my tooth.  We put the stone and my piece of tooth on a napkin which they took to the kitchen, came back, verified that it was a stone and said, ""sorry.""

I guess to me, for a $600+ meal, that wasn't good enough.  So, as you wade through the grass sandwiches and ""unifying with nature"" beware that it is possible that their preparation did not purge these delicacies from the rocks that also come in nature.  Disappointed.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/75/3f/3b/caption.jpg

The plates are thought out and designed to the smallest of detail. I was simply amazed by the taste from course to course (""I was blown away by the salad and the fruit praline: how can you achieve such a taste with raw food?"") .The courses follow each other in a well-thought-out order, where it seems that each plate prepares you for the next one and at the same time, together they form a story. Not only that prestigious ingredients (trout, venison, oysters) shine in this story but sublime are also humble barley, polenta, carrots, potatoes, sour cream. A tribute to the authentic Slovenian home cooking cannot be overlooked here, and as a Slovenian guest I am extremely grateful for it. 

Not only the food is superb, but also the service: I don't know if I ever felt so welcomed, relaxed, anywhere. 

I thought this dinner would be a once in a lifetime experience, but now I can't wait to come back. Sincere thanks!

Each of the 16 courses was beautiful, visually and in terms of flavor. The freshness of the herbs, leaves, fruits, and vegetables made them the star of the meal. Such great combinations and delicious flavor. The river trout was local and just seemed to make sense in this beautiful mountain setting. The carrot ice cream was a game changer and I was searching for recipes right after we left the restaurant.

I’m not a fan of game meats and did not enjoy the roebuck at all, but each and every bite of the other 15 courses was a special once in a lifetime experience.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/a0/38/15/caption.jpg

Food was obviously very good. There were few misses too, which were little unexpected. Dining took too long time. I entered to the restaurant 19:15 and left it (not having extra cheese, coffee or digestive) at 23:30. Service was professional and friendly. Wine pouring was very small, especially when all wines were meant for multiple dishes. Some wines were poured more, but it didn’t leave a good feeling.
17 courses including amuse bouche, if you can call it that, size of all the portions was more or less the same throughout the dinner:
1. Caviar, etc. Spicy, good, too big for one bite, impossible to cut with spoon provided
2. Crab, etc. Good size, good taste
3. Plant sandwich. Again two big for one bite, difficult to cut by teeth into two
4. Donut with smoked roe. Very good!
5. Potato with a salty crest. Absolutely awful! Crest was unbelievable salty. Potato was potato
6. Spring harvest. Okay, nothing special
7. Peas. Excellent!
8. Taglioni. Too salty again! 
9. Trout. Good
10. Capperletti. Very good!
11. Barley. Some of it was raw, not good
12. Lamb pelmeni. Spicy, good
13. Meat on two pieces. Good, although difficult to cut ingredients with spoon and fork
14. Carrot ice-cream to clear palate. A bit strange but not bad
15. Sweet potato dumpling. Very sweet, more kind of a cheese portion
16. One strawberry. Well, strawberry, not very good one
17. Spicy pumpkin. Candy
Optional cheese was offered after the dessert…?!

Classy wine pairing:
1. Champagne, Pierre Paillard Les Parcelles Bouzy Grand Cru. Very small pouring, too mineral for my taste
2. Slovenian white, Marlon Batic Vipava 2021. Very good, small portion, refilled
3. Slovenian white, Hedele Malvazija Coce 2020. Good!
4. Vonograd trilogia, white. Good
5. Slovenian chardonney. Good
6. Slovenian red, Brutus, 90% merlot. Goo, but again nor enough
7. Italian sweet, Picolit. Okay","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/c1/1f/dd/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Sensational?  Spectacular?  Epic?  Artful?  Uber-Creative?","Where do you begin when everything is so appetizing, well put together, tantalizing, unexpected, and flavorsome? When more than your sense of taste, is involved and you get a balanced experience between sight, touch, smell, and feel.  An incredible dance for the palate.

First, they start with a heavy white bowl filled with wonderful, freshly picked, damp forest moss and ask you to feel it and smell it as a connection back to nature, a grounding to the present, which is what their menu represents.  A bond, an association with the richness of nature’s many tastes, textures, colors, smells, and more.  A connection to the local area, to now.

From the Fifty Shades of Life menu, a wink to Ana Roš and Hiša Franko Restaurant turning 50!  Hoping for many more based on my experience here.  
In awe of each dish (there were 18 of them – including the one you bring home), I kept wondering where such unfathomable creativity comes from.  What kind of genius dreams-up stuff like that?   Fig leaf granita mixed with puffed buckwheat?  Beeswax fondue?  Shiso leaf with mescal infused melon?  Fig leaf kombucha tea. 

The staff flowed through the tables, the outside patio, and all the rooms effortlessly and seamlessly.  Whatever they promised, they never forgot to do.  For example, they knew where I came from and one of their chef comes from the same part of Canada so at the end of the meal (at which point I had forgotten they would connect us) we met and it turns out he came from a mere 20km from where I do.  Small world.  Staff seems to be from many places, our server was from Colorado, USA, that chef from Québec, Canada, and many more.

There was no stuffy orchestration even though the coordination was flawless.

Even if you can’t or don’t want to drink alcohol, they have wonderful selections.  I tried two of their Kombucha teas and both were marvelous, especially the fig leaf one (excellent and super refreshing, almost like a palate cleanser between courses).

It’s definitely not only about the presentation, the food, and the ambiance.  What I also appreciated was just how connected the staff were with one another.  Also their obvious love of the food.  No matter how obscure a question was, they had an answer.  I didn’t, for example, know what a lacto-fermented tomato water was (PS.  It has nothing to do with milk).  Once it was described to me, it helped me better understand the food I was served.  So it is not only a tasting experience, but also a learning one.  

I had a bit of a fear of coming to my first Michelin restaurant because I thought it would be a stodgy, pretentious place.  As it turned out, everyone was very approachable, candid, polite, inquisitive, and fun, all the while attentive and professional.  I could go on, but I’ll let you go and enjoy a meal there.  I felt alive when I finished my meal despite the full stomach and the late hour.  The portions and pace of each serving were perfect so I never felt overloaded.  I would say, only one course wasn’t as good as all the others (too salty), the rest were all excellent and surprising.

Kudos to this amazing team who pulls this miracle night after night.  Thank you for the great experience.

When checking out, you receive a menu signed by Ana herself accompanied by a specially made candy to take home.  I am glad that my first Michelin experience was here.  It will be hard to surpass.

Some of the servings were perhaps a little too big - we had problems in eating it all.... - and very friendly and competent serving staff.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Svetlana, shown to our room and went for a late lunch. Tilen recommended a fantastic local bubbly, and it went together just excellently with the local cheeses on offer.
The setting of Hisa is unique, so we basked in a summer sun, sipped on the bubbles in the blooming garden and chilled.
Dinner:
17 courses, spanning across 3-4 hours, plus an option for a cheese board, go for it.
Fantastic selection of wines at very reasonable prices.
Having a really bad experience from a 1star restaurant in Berlin recently, our worries faded away immediately after the opener and we just felt great, going on a culinary journey on and on.
Is 17 dishes little or too much? Just right I would say, in Hisa´s case.
Staff: WONDERFUL.
We had so much fun, as Maria, being from US, suddenly spoke to us in Czech the evening took a different spin, it was great.
The sommelier, young lady, was spot on. We did not opt for the wine pairing, but went instead for a superb 2008 blanc de blancs grand cru, couple glasses of wonderful reds and finished it off with an amazing Tokai. 

This was an experience worth waiting for and if we ever have a chance to visit again, we won´t hesitate.
Greatest thanks to Tilen, Svetlana, Maria and rest of the staff.
You are guys doing a fantastic job and you can be proud of it.
Hope to see you soon again.

Crew is multinational and they have very relax approach to the customer during service which does not means that they are not professional.

Unfortunately the meal… maybe it was the mussel or maybe it was the timothy hay crusted potato or something else, …gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill for the following 24 hours.  Not a pleasant experience on your vacation!  There was no other possible source than the meal at Hisa Franko.  It was not a flu virus.  To add insult to injury when I indicated to Hisa Franko what had happened they were not apologetic nor would they refund the cost of my meal.  While I understand that mistakes can happen I cannot understand their staunch denial that I could get sick from their meal.  As I said before, there was no other possible source.  Perhaps they need to understand that the customer’s experience is not all about the story of the preparation of the food but also how the customer feels once they leave the restaurant.  I had much more pleasant experiences eating other Slovenian food elsewhere.","1","","NONE","2023-06-30","2023-06-27","2023-06-27","en","HISA FRANKO","1059106","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r898412936-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html"

The rooms are nicely & homely decorated offering the basics for overnight stay, but sadly no air conditioning what you would expect in this level locations. 

The two stars are setting expectation level to the top. The check in was very smooth and professional. We were invited for aperetifs before dinner, but this turned out that we were to order drinks from their menu. The set up outdoors was though very nice.

The restaurant venue is classy and stylish. The service was overwhelming. The food (tasting menu) was extensive and very nicely presented. Sadly the tastes were often a bit mild and basically all food was eaten with your fingers. The wine package of local wines was just ok, nothing really special. 

Chef Ana Ros visited the tables many time what was really nice.

Breakfast was as a whole a nice experience. Just surprising that you are expected to pay extras for your coffees and teas. 

All in all, a nice experience but sadly did not meet our expectations.","2","","NONE","2022-07-31","2022-11-29","2022-11-29","en","HISA FRANKO","1059106","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r870106499-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html"

So creative, and beautiful presentation.

 The Lacto Fermented tomato water, elderberry, elderberry and tarragon
Pastrami beef tongue, jalapeño and crystal algae
     Was that it was so shocking flavorful, I needed another one to really taste it.  It was wonderful. 

The only disappointment was a dish I was thinking could have been a highlight.
Potato baked in August hay crust, cultured butter with lovage and horseradish.
The potato was only mildly warm, and the butter was very cold as to not melt on the potato, so not capturing the whole favor of the dish.  Something that both should have been warmer,

The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, wines were very good.

Having worked in the past in the food service industry, I found it is nice to be recognized by upper management.  With only 7 tables it shouldn't have been hard to either say hi or ask about the meal.  While both manager and chef were out on the floor, this did not happen.
