When I did do the reservation, they only had one star and I was not aware about the recent development. So I did struggle all the evening to understand how blind the Michelin testers could have been to not leave two or even three stars for this restaurant. Just when I got the bill which had the two stars and the green one imprinted. I could do justice to the Michelin testers… And I really think there is potential for a third star. We have been to the only two 3* restaurants in Norway just one respectively seven days before, so we could well compare. And we would rate the Kontrast in between. To be precise we would place it ahead of Maaemo. 

The only thing they need to work on is the acoustic at their place . it’s rather loud, which makes it difficult to understand the explanations about the dishes and drinks. Maybe some noise cancelling on the ceiling and some noise cancelling sculptures could help

But overall, I truly fully recommend this place  and think the team for a perfect evening.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/1d/d5/46/caption.jpg

It was awarded one Michelin star in 2016. Its team aims to use the preservation and fermentation technology of its sister company b.culture to present Scandinavian food on the table. Not only that, the restaurant is proud of the source of its ingredients, sourcing wild fish, organic or wild meat. Founder and Brand Chef Mikael Svensson was born in Skåne and trained in the local 🍳school in Kristianstad as an adult. His career continued in Oslo and he worked at Le Canard (1994-2014 Michelin one 🌟, translated as 🦆) in the early 2000s. He then worked in several Michelin one-, two- and three-star restaurants in Europe, among which the more famous ones are 🇪🇸restaurants Quique Dacosta and Martin Berasategui","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/08/5e/34/dish.jpg

Food and wine-pairing were outstanding. The service was excellent. They had no problems adapting the menu to allergens. 

All in all, we had an excellent evening here. 

If there is anything that we would have liked differently, it would be the food presentation. The staff come from different countries and speak different levels of English, so when you try to pronounce difficult Norwegian names and ingredients, it can be difficult to understand it well. The other thing that would have been nice would be to receive a copy of the menu to take home.

Atmosphere: 4","Service needs work but the food is excellent","Born in Skåne Mikael Svensson began his career in Oslo before stints with 3* Spaniards Quique Dacosta and Martin Berasategui, a focus on ""organic and ethically sourced Ingredients from within Norway"" seeing Restaurant Kontrast show off local producers and the Animals they raise. 

Stating “the end result is never better than the quality of the Product you start with,” a fact frequently overlooked in today’s low-cost and convenience driven market, it is through temperatures and textures frequently found in juxtaposition that Svensson builds layered bites tied together through the use of acid, fermentation and Herbs.

A fifteen-course tasting that begins in the lounge, cement floors and exposed ceilings creating an industrial feel that magnifies noise from other tables, opening bites consist of bold flavors such as Scallops with bitter Vegetables and Shrimp with Horseradish before moving on to a delicate Donut followed by a Pork Blood Croustade topped in Vinegar-splashed Cheese.

Going down the street for a Sunchoke and Tim Wendelboe Coffee before taking a seat in front of the open kitchen, just five Chefs running three seatings simultaneously, a vibrant White Wine from Hungary proved adept to handling first Turnips and Sea Snails with Caviar then poignant Crab Curry imbued with Garum atop Carrots and Sour Cream.

Refusing to outsource Sauces, Mikael’s XO a three-year process made on-site, Crucifers spung to life before Wild Halibut and Chicken with Mushrooms, Soy and a complex reduction featuring Yellow Wine with Sweet Corn.

Slowing as the room filled up, lengthy waits between courses seeing the final four items take longer than the first eight, aged Lamb brought plenty of flavor to match Cherries plus Coffee before frozen Kraftkar Bleu Cheese and Sunflower Seed Ice Cream shocked the palate in preparation for elegantly arranged Plums followed by Mignardises.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/68/5a/02/caption.jpg

After traveling in Europe and working at several Michelin restaurants to continue his education, he returned to Oslo and eventually opened Kontrast (without any investors!) in 2013.  The restaurant is at its second location in a sparse, industrial-like space (Vulkan) and received its first star in 2016.  It has retained that distinction ever since.

I was met at the front desk, my reservation confirmed, and immediately brought to a couch by the kitchen.  I ordered an aperitif (“Lost in Oslo”… named because if you have more than one you will reflect the title) and four nibbles followed: razor clams, grilled tomato, mackerel with cucumber/wasabi, and a fantastic pork blood “croustade” with Holtefjell XO cheese.  An eight-course meal ensued at my table in the dining room with a wine pairing.  This was very well done and followed the classic “lighter fare to heavier fare and then dessert” concept that is universal at these places largely because it makes sense.  Highlights included grilled wild halibut (with zucchini and pesto) and pork belly (with cabbage, black apple, and bread miso sauce).  Service was flawless, with the maitre'd Sylvester being equally considerate, professional, knowledgable, and attentive.

I made the comment several times during the meal that “a one-star in Europe equals two in the US,” and the more I think about it a more honest and less offensive way of saying this is “this restaurant clearly is in two-star territory.”  I’ve eaten at over eighty Michelin restaurants on four continents and had bumps-in-the-road on all of them;  Kontrast clearly is a highlight.  The fact that they focus on sustainable food and smaller purveyors only made a great experience better.

This was an overall fantastic meal and one I would consistently return to if I lived in town.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/11/8f/1a/kontrast-sourdough-bread.jpg

Every dish is delicious, beautifully presented, and offers a combination of familiar and unexpected.

I have rarely experienced this lack of equilibrium in dishes: for instance the scallop, a sweet and delicate affair on its own, was absolutely butchered by one of the overly acidic sauce. Choosing to serve frozen blue cheese (and a lot of it) as a pre-dessert is also a significant faux-pas. I generally agree with Michelin ratings, but I am failing to see the flair and ability here.

The service was good at the beginning, but the pace of the dishes was awfully slow and I feel that the waiters got tired and bored as the night progresses. To the point that we barely got a 'thanks' after paying. The last hour of service was probably the worst I have ever experienced in a similar establishment. I only save the french sommelier as she was efficient and nice throughout the entire service, the only true professional in my opinion.

And at around 200 euros per person, I would completely avoid the place if you know your fine dining.","1","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-11","2021-10-11","en","Restaurant Kontrast","5551804","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r813996325-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

We strongly recommend it if you’re visiting Oslo and you want to celebrate something special :) 

The prices of the food menu are reasonable comparing to any other restaurant in Oslo with normal food…the prices only double those, but Kontrast quality is much better than double :) (just to say something, the drinks prices are quite high, as in every Michelin restaurant)

The place is super nice, you feel really comfortable and the service is excellent! As they notice that we were Spanish they told an Spanish waiter to come to our table and explain all the dishes to us :)

Food: 5","Well worth the visit","Delightful in every aspect. Fantastic service, pleasant ambience, and of course an impeccable meal. Set aside the entire evening, and don’t make any plans for the following morning.

Me and my partner went to Kontrast on a Thursday evening. We weren’t celebrating anything, but perhaps we should have; one is so well taken care of that a visit there feels like a reward or a gift.

From the very start one is met with professionalism and great service. We were greeted at the door by a smiling and welcoming head waitress which set the bar for the whole evening. The premises were sparsely decorated, but well-kept and most importantly - clean. Even though we sat in a relatively small room with approx. 15 tables, it didn’t feel crowded. The acoustics were spot-on, making the experience intimate as one is not disturbed by noise from the room. We had no problem conversing at a casual volume, which is remarkable considering the fact that the guests dine in the same room as the kitchen where the chefs are at full work. They even managed to place a little lounge area between the dining area and the entrance without it feeling stuffed or out of place. This restaurant is a case in point to the importance of architecture and interior design.

The food was, as expected, flawless. Everything from the combination of flavors to the presentation of the dishes to the construction of the menu to the variety of ingredients used was spot on. The attention to detail dedicated to the arrangement on the plate was immaculate, the work of true artists. The highlights of the evening were the strawberry dessert with sunflower seed butter (a match made in heaven with the salt and sweet), the kale and cauliflower dish (the kale was cooked to perfection) as well as the halibut with rucola sauce (the intense taste of chlorophyl from the sauce went like a charm with the fish).

There were some exciting surprises during the meal - duck breast cured in coffee (delicious), poached oyster covered in sour cream, and crab marinated in aquavit. For the most part, however, the combination of flavors was conventional - seafood and cucumber, strawberries and cream, veal and mushroom. Which is not to say that it is a bad thing. Their craftmanship is uncontested, but their experimentation with flavors and preparation techniques wasn’t cutting edge. The freeze-and-crumble technique that was used on the blue cheese, for example, was neat but it’s getting a bit old.

We ordered, as we always do, one juice pairing and one wine pairing. The juice pairing was a gift that kept on giving, with each new glass more delicious than the last. Many of the juices consisted of different varieties of tea, and I firmly believe that some had the potential of being sold as soft drinks in their own right. Anyone dining at Kontrast simply must try the juice pairing.

Some food for thought did enter my mind as we progressed through the meal. No menu was provided for the evening. During the presentation of each dish it was at times hard to catch everything of what was being said, as well as remember it afterwards. Without the menu, we weren’t able to go back or double-check the ingredients of each dish. As we discuss every aspect of these kinds of meals vigorously, we both would have appreciated information about the menu in writing in order to refer to it later.

I would have skipped one dish. We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal and one dish in particular seemed, in hindsight, unnecessary. It was a squid dish, consisting mainly of pasta. With the overweight of seafood in the meal, the squid dish being quite basic, and with the carbs taking up so much precious intestinal space, the meal would have been all the better for it.

The name of the restaurant also begs the question: what contrasts? Again, the food was immaculately prepared, but whatever contrasts found therein were customary. Salt in contrast to the sweet. Crunch in contrast to the creamy. Red in contrast to the green. I would have expected nothing more from a 1-star restaurant. Surely the name isn’t a play on such basic knowledge in cooking? So if not the food, then where?

The choice of wines at times was not optimal to my taste. The cheese dish, consisting of maple syrup, blue cheese and ice cream would have fared better with a sweet white wine rather than the port-like red wine we were served. And I also wasn’t too fond of the Jura red wine with the sweetbread – too dry and acidic. 

The choice of music was also unorthodox – ‘90s and 2000’s alternative rock. So long as the volume is set right it was unproblematic, but it did occur to me that the rowdy music doesn’t necessarily compliment the fine dining we were undertaking.

But make no mistake – Kontrast is a fantastic place to go for a very nice meal. You will feel welcome, you will be well taken care of, and you will have the most wonderful meal. Be it friends, colleagues or couples, this place will cater to your every need and desire.","0","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-07-30","2021-07-30","en","Restaurant Kontrast","5551804","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r800708768-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

We had high expectations for the visit and the start was very promising with a warm welcome (but no one opened the door or greeted us by the door so we were a bit puzzled by that). The restaurant had many new dishes on the set menu that did not seem to have been tested out sufficient before it reached the table of the guest paying a lot for the food. When I dine at a Michelin restaurant I expect top-notch. I am wondering if this place would have had a star if it was located outside of Oslo? Both Re-Naa when it had one star (now 2 stars) and Speilsalen (visited a few months before they received a star) are way above in service, attendance and  food/wine.","0","","COUPLES","2021-06-30","2021-07-25","2021-07-25","en","Restaurant Kontrast","5551804","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r799666093-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"
