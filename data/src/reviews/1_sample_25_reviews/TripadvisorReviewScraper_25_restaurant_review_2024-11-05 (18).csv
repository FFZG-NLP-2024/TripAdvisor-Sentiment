","We were staying at the Mercure next door and made a reservation for dinner. Everything was exceptional! Probably the best fish dishes we've ever had, and we've been to plenty of starred restaurants. We took the 5 course menu dégustation with 5 wine pairings. All the wines went really well with the dishes. We loved every dish too. We changed the first course from snails (I don't eat) to the rouget, and that might have been my favorite. It's hard to decide, they were all so delicious! Service was great too. I think this restaurant might be my new favorite. And it was right next to Les Balneades (spa) so it was a perfect couple of days getaway.

The choice of local products or directly from Mr Hay's greenhouse is a philosophy of the establishment.

But in our opinion - all four of us - we are crossing a red line here in terms of quantity. When a guest - with a bird's appetite - is still hungry after the meal we tell ourselves that there is no point in going to the restaurant. 150 gr maximum all included, from appetizer to dessert. The lamb? Half a bite! Returning from fishing? Portions to cry, ten seconds of pleasure, but no more. Paying almost five hundred euros for four people (without wine) to go out hungry is enough to put you off gourmet restaurants. Not to mention that the wines are too expensive, the usual coefficient of 4 or 5 being here more like 7 or 8.","2","","BUSINESS","2024-05-31","2024-06-12","2024-06-12","en","La Table Christophe Hay Et Loïs Bée","14768322","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1079434-d14768322-r954831014-La_Table_Christophe_Hay_Et_Lois_Bee-Ardon_Loiret_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

A sober and very tasteful setting combines with an excellent welcome.
At the table, a delicate presence settles in. You don't have to wait several long minutes before the Chef comes in person to invite you to open the ball of flavors.
We avoid long hesitations among the choices by offering you 3 types of menus, which must satisfy the most demanding.

The Chef will then be followed by friendly and attentive staff who provoke the desire for discoveries to come.

To confirm the comparison to a ball, it is a series of ballets which follow one another where the actors of the composition of your choice come themselves to serve you and present their dishes to you. A very original method which illustrates, as in the theatre, a communion between the artists and the audience.

A well-deserved star.

The setting is pleasant, in particular I really appreciated the noise level, which was quite reasonable for a full restaurant. I will keep a fabulous memory of this lunch.","0","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-01-20","2024-01-20","en","La Table Christophe Hay Et Loïs Bée","14768322","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1079434-d14768322-r934795466-La_Table_Christophe_Hay_Et_Lois_Bee-Ardon_Loiret_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

Atmosphere: 5","To discover near Orléans","Beautiful establishment, kitchen open to the main room (rare enough to be highlighted among the Michelin-starred).
Welcome up to the star standard, neat and refined decoration.
Let's talk about serious things.
Chef Christophe Hay is right to trust Loïs Bée to manage the kitchen, supported by his wife in supervising the room and the team.
The menu offers several very ""captivating"" and ""innovative"" menus with each dish a beautiful story which will be told to you sometimes by the master of the juices, sometimes by the sommelier but also by the second or even the pastry chef, without forgetting by Loïs Bée in person who will pass on her passion and her standards to you. We appreciated this “team close to the guests” dimension. Absolutely worth testing","1","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-16","2023-10-16","en","La Table Christophe Hay Et Loïs Bée","14768322","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1079434-d14768322-r921542398-La_Table_Christophe_Hay_Et_Lois_Bee-Ardon_Loiret_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"
