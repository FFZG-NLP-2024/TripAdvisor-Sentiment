The food was based on local ingredients and the recipes were based on autumn/winter. We went in November 2022 but I didn`t get that as an alternative.","0","","FAMILY","2023-11-30","2024-08-28","2024-08-28","en","Restaurant K2","21140949","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r967144512-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Lovely restaurant but expensive and slow.","I do not recommend this obviously well regarded restaurant for solo travelers.  The pacing is exceedingly slow with (sometimes very) small dishes served 15-20 minutes apart, leaving a lot of time between dishes . I note that at least one other duo kept looking around the corner anxiously looking for their next bites.
It is a lovely interior with an open kitchen; several other diners stopped by the kitchen to rhapsodize about their experience and the food, but not me.  I generally found the complex dishes ok but nothing exciting. 
It’s not cheap- the meat and fish menu was 1430 kroner and the drink pairing (7 rather small servings) was another 1050. There is no pre-set pairing for the snacks, so the recommended champagne match was 280 kroner. The champagne was my preferred beverage of those served. One wine - the Momento Mori from Australia- was tasted but not consumed. Maybe just not for me as my serving was the last drops from the bottle, so not a bottle issue. Only one other pairing- a Barbera with the veal - was anything I’d order again. 
The pairings included a beer and a cider. As I informed the wait staff I did not want any cocktails, a wine was substituted for the final pairing (with dessert) of a lingonberry cocktail. (When I first told the waiter that I did not drink cocktails I got a push back saying it was part of the restaurant’s philosophy). This wine was served before being brought to the table, perhaps a first in my experience at any Michelin rated restaurant.
After 3 ¼ hours, shorter than others who say 4 hours, I was still hungry. Neither the food nor beverage portions were very robust.
Each dish was presented with a detailed explanation, largely showcasing the restaurant’s commendable commitment to sustainability.
I hesitate to rate the restaurant only 3 stars, but even if every dish was outstandingly tasty, the cost, pace and quantity of food would have left me dissatisfied. But maybe not as much.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-08-24","2024-08-24","en","Restaurant K2","21140949","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r966490969-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html"

Dinner takes 4 hours","It’s a very green restaurant, where chef besides using very natural products tries to do something with leftovers. And it obtains very good (Michelin green star as a proof).
There are two different options of a set - Meat&fish and Vegetarian. We’ve chosen Meat&fish one. The set is good, but not striking. Some dishes are interesting, but majority are average. Course (10 servings) costs 1430 NOK, they also offer a wine paring (7 courses) for 950 NOK or 630 NOK if you prefer non-alcoholic drinks.
There are good cocktails (4 in the menu), they are recommended for snack servings, but cocktails also good suit for other dishes:) there is also a wine card, but this time there we no orange wine by glass. The restaurant’s sommelier advised us very interesting floral Riesling and it was definitely very good choice. 
But the dinner is longer than it should be - pauses between starters are 15-20min, between main dishes are 30min, so be ready to spend 4 hours for 10-course set. And it’s really a downside of this place - excitement is gone.
Staff is friendly and energizing.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/8c/88/c0/caption.jpg

The food was great and the staff were all really friendly, we enjoyed our seat by the kitchen and being able to chat to Eirik and ask any questions we had.

The resourcefulness they demonstrate is really cool, “last night’s” rye bread with onion scraps was one of my wife’s favourite dishes and using pear cores from last season to flavour cocktails is very imaginative.

The “potato and whey” was the most underwhelming sounding course yet tasted fantastic, as did most of the food - the odd bit wasn’t to my taste but I’m not a fish fan so expected that before I arrived! (And I’m sure if I’d told them rather than choosing to try the fish they’d have adopted the menu and given me the vegetarian equivalents, they did for my wife)

Would definitely recommend and hope they continue to succeed!","0","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-01-19","2024-01-19","en","Restaurant K2","21140949","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r934668125-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html"

Not the BIG WOW factors, but solid work of a big team with ambitions. Maybe less ‘’’ambitions’’ would suit the  tastes/food  better  (less is more)?
The ‘’wine pack’’ was  special with coctails in between- the plum  coctail was 👍🏻👍🏻.

However,  the main reason for not giving a higher score is-
I was hungry when  i arrived, and I was hungry when I left!
For that price I don’t expect to leave to go home  and have to eat.

Food: 5","""The"" place to visit in Stavanger for a wonderful evening","Prior to actually attending dinner, we had deferred our reservation on many occasions due to Corona restrictions, however during the time the communication with the restaurant was precise and informative, checking allergies/dietary requirements etc.

Upon arrival, we were politely greeted by one of the owners, who gently notified us of the required safety measures they have in place.

The restaurant is very calming and minimal, whilst being elegant and offering a well put together  (discrete) playlist (another passion of the owner).

The offering is either a vegetarian or a meat/fish 7-course tasting menu (I being very fussy, opted for a mixture of vegetarian and fish) of which they were more than happy to accommodate.  Together with a drinks package and an extensive wine list.  Our guests opted for the drinks package, which was exciting to see emerge and learn how they suit the food; whilst we went for a beautiful, well priced, organic bottle (or 2) of Syrah.

I could go on for some time, talking about how fabulous the food was, which left us saying lots of ""ohhhs"" and ""arrghs"", however, I would hate the ruin the surprise.  Though bear in mind the food was truly spectacular, made with so much love and passion and changes regularly.

All the staff were attentive and knowledgeable about both food and drink and obviously take a great deal of pride in their passion for food (plus they all remembered my allergy).

This fabulous restaurant gets booked up, so it's advisable to book a good few weeks ahead and whilst is not the cheapest restaurant in this up and coming area, it is by far one of the best meals I have ever had in Stavanger.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/07/51/50/all-edible.jpg

Even so this time visiting K2. But what a surprise! Everything was excellent. Service and presentations of wine, drinks and food were extensive, beautiful and interesting. The combination of different basics was creative as was the mix of flavors and spices. We had wine pairing. Innovative and different compared to the usual. With this restaurant Stavanger has the next Michelin starred restaurant! We will, of course, come back.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/e6/25/f0/photo3jpg.jpg

And rightly so, because the menu is determined by the catch of the day and every part of the fish is used, right down to the bread. Very cheerful.

It was so worth the money. The dishes were works of art in themselves and it is so impressive how they manage to use up all the ingredients. Not even the fish skin is thrown away, it turns into tasty chips. Cider from the family at Randaberg was also served, we had lots of exciting wines to go with each and every course. After we finished, we were given a tour of the kitchen. It was a good atmosphere to be in, the waiters and waitresses were full of energy and they took their time with us.

Atmosphere: 5","A strong culinary personality, a memorable experience","Ola Klepp's cuisine is full of tastes, many of which are new to a French palate: bitterness, acidity, complex pairings, in short a happy mixture of flavors. The pairing of non-alcoholic drinks, very successful overall, reinforced this journey with unusual taste impressions (elderberry, verbena, spruce, lime, strawberries, kombucha, etc.).
However, the start of the meal did not start off in the best way: the dried fish skin with turnip was a successful start aesthetically but not of exciting taste; just as the ceviche which followed proved to be of little interest. 
We were then very disappointed, when the following dishes took us into another universe that was infinitely more interesting and tasty. This was first the case for the mackerel, with monkfish liver cream and buckwheat cream, accompanied by bread with a strong personality and a small salad; the beef tartare with black pudding and grilled green pepper proved to be a great dish; the next, the catch of the day, was accompanied by a sublime seafood sauce, with a lightness at the same time as an anthological depth of taste; everything else was of the same level, with special mention for the combination of celeriac and mushrooms, another very great dish, as well as the lamb cooked twice with miso sauce: great art! The strawberry and rhubarb dessert was an apotheosis of taste and freshness; exceptional sweet treats of lightness and originality - including an astonishing cannelé of a quality never before achieved in the French restaurants where I was able to taste them - came to end this meal.
One of the originalities of this restaurant is that it is the cooks who, in turn, come to bring you and describe - extensively - the dishes.
The restaurant is small, the kitchen is open and we were in immediate contact with the kitchen, a real spectacle but with the disadvantage of leaving with clothes soaked in the smell of charcoal…
All this is not cheap (around €450 for two, with drinks), but we came away, after 2h45, with stronger impressions than during our dinner at Maaemo, in Oslo (a three-star restaurant) , two years ago, when everything was perfect, but the flavors less marked (and the addition even much saltier).
At K2, with the exception of the first two dishes, which were quite unconvincing, everything else was of a level well above a Michelin star.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/75/de/93/caption.jpg

Very good food! Deep-fried fish skin that should have been available in a bag, lovely cod and lamb that melts on the tongue. The strawberries had also arrived, delicious fresh desserts and a really good rhubarb tarte tatin.
Don't forget the drinks either, these were the best we had tasted in a long time. The strawberry daiquiri was out of this world!

We were welcomed and given a nice table in beautiful surroundings. This was shellfish lunch. Felt a bit chaotic as we got a lot of food on the table at the same time. Good oysters and scallops. Both a sight for the eyes. The power in the scallop tasted heavenly. We got mussels and boat potatoes, the mussels tasted lovely, but they could have dropped the potatoes for me. Ceviche of long was good, and very nicely presented. We ate salmon stir-fry, which is always good. Got fresh prawns which were a bit tame in colour. Prawns taste best in the winter months. The last dish was pepper crab, good! A marsupial crab was used. It was slightly broken, so difficult to eat with a knife and fork as utensils. Norwegian strawberries with herbs for dessert, delicious! The food was presented and we were recommended lovely drinks to go with the food. A little lacking in service in relation to the level, such as checking in on the table to hear if the food tasted good or if we needed anything. Reacted to the fact that no one said thank you for the visit, or hade and welcome back when we left. Good, but below expectations in relation to the fact that this is a Michelin restaurant, both in terms of food and service.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/11/0b/19/caption.jpg","FRIENDS","2024-05-31","2024-05-05","2024-05-05","en","Restaurant K2","21140949","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190511-d21140949-r949587795-Restaurant_K2-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html"
