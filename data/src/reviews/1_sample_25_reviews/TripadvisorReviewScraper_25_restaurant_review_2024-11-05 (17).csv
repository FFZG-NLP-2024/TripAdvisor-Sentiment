The staff was attentive, charming, helpful, knowledgeable and above all else professional. The environment was pristine without being pompous, elegant yet warm and inviting. The music reflected the calm relaxing vibe of the canal flowing just beyond the windows. And the food exemplified the rare and delicate balance between ingenuity, artistry, expertise and flavor that other restaurants strive for, but often miss. Flore is not just a restaurant it is an experience, one you deserve!","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","Restaurant Flore","2315768","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r976746869-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

We had the Omnivore menu with the seasonal wine pairing. It was an extraordinary gastronomic journey, beginning with four amuse bouche where I fell in love with the fried oyster in miso, then we continued with seven dishes where colours and flavours  combined like magic. The main course was the lamb, it was very juicy and extremely tender. We had the opportunity to taste this dish inside the kitchen at the chef’s table and it was great seeing the chef’s team at work. The dinner closed with an amazing dessert, that combined tomatoes with raspberry, and with the friandise. Everything was perfect. Sommeliers, waiters and chefs moved lik ballet dancers in the room, incredible.","0","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-14","2024-07-14","en","Restaurant Flore","2315768","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r959485018-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

For my birthday, I chose to bring my wife for a full experience, leaving to Flore's team the opportunity  to express their capacities on the selection of ingredients and  wine paring to be combined with. 
""Omnivore menu"" is an absolute culinary journey between fresh and preserved ingredients, with outstanding textures and presentation. 
Wine paring goes from Kombucha, Sake, Sherry and biodynamic wines, adding an incredible feeling to each course.  We also ordered Krug 171eme by the glass, such a treat.
Flore also has an extended wine list (recently awarded recognition by Wine Spectator), with big names and well chosen vintages. 
Staff is friendly, very professional and caring. Detailed and well prepared each time you need more info regarding items on each dish or questions on the wines. 
Looking forward to be there again this year.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/d3/4f/4c/caption.jpg

The other (extremely meager) courses had poorly matched flavor and texture, heavily focused on grassiness. We left hungry and hassled because the service was prolonged as well. Despite our clear requests upon booking and arrival at the restaurant that we finish in 2.5 hours, they failed to complete service in under 3 hours, and we raced to the airport to catch our flight. To provide context, we have eaten in Michelin restaurants for over 30 years throughout Europe and the US, and this was the most disappointing meal to date. We have allergies and dietary requirements, which were fully communicated to the restaurant in advance, but they still struggled to serve a first amuse-bouche after 45 minutes of waiting. The staff became defensive, saying they had to adapt to the diets causing the delay, but this information had been provided long in advance. They simply were not prepared. One amuse-bouche of kohlrabi with sour broth and gummy mini dumplings lacked seasoning and enjoyable texture. It was served in a partially- hollowed kohlrabi on a bed of leaves, but 95% of what was plated was inedible. We regretted not having a goat with us to enjoy most of what was served. This dish also resulted in a stomach ache for my son, leaving him in the bathroom for much of the meal and unable to eat any further courses. (More on that later!)  The other amuse-bouche of a cucumber and leaf with green oily pesto was incredibly messy to eat. In general, it seemed like the chef had never tried to eat what he served because it was clumsy to eat the courses as presented with crockery and cutlery. A potato spaghetti dish was impossible to twirl on a fork and too big for the round, awkward spoon. I could go on and on about how they missed the mark on making food that was both delicious and elegant to eat. The dessert was a green, grassy dish that did nothing to finish the meal with any sweet satisfaction. The texture of swallowing leaf after leaf was wholly unenjoyable. One of the most glaring errors of the lunch was the plating of the post-dessert bite... a rhubarb custard was served in a clamshell on a bed of real snail shells. How inappropriate in general, but especially for the vegetarians in our group! As stated earlier, the only item anyone in our party would want to eat again was the bread, BUT when we asked for more, we were told that they only make enough rolls for the number of people booked each day. They managed to find one squashed piece for my son, but that was the only one left. Back to service and my son... as I mentioned, the strange vegetable combinations in the amuse-bouche gave him a terrible stomach ache, and he was unable to eat any of the further five courses in the meal. The staff NEVER asked if he was okay, despite my hinting that the food triggered his illness. They were more focused on fussing about, folding his napkin in a perfect triangle as he came and left from the bathroom. At the end, they tried to seem accommodating by offering to ""make an exception for him"" and serve him French fries not on the menu, but greasy food was not what a sick teenager needed. Their insensitivity is inexcusable. They charged him the full 150 euro, despite having eaten nothing because of his pain. As a point of comparison, we were at Taillevent 20 years ago, and one person in our group was ill and only eating small bites of every course. When the bill arrived, there was no charge for the ill gentleman's meal. We even enquired if there was a mistake, but the maître d'hôtel insisted that the restaurant only charged those who could enjoy a full Michelin gastronomic experience. Flore could learn something from the French. The arrogance and incompetence that we felt throughout the meal at Flore left us wondering how they maintain a 2* Michelin rating. The restaurant is oblivious to true client needs and incapable of making an exceptional dining experience. They operate in a little bubble within a luxury hotel, catering to tourists looking to be impressed by strange flavors and textures, rather than truly delicious ones.","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-09","2024-07-09","en","Restaurant Flore","2315768","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r958689690-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

The atmosphere alone is a good support to the beautiful cuisine served there.
The menu is set with a series of sometimes seemingly unremarkable dishes that are invariably delicately twisted in an innovative and fascinating new take on what came disguised as unremarkable. Some of the combinations, ingredients, and preparations are mind-boggling, bordering on genius.
The room is small enough that diners can be eat one of the dishes in the menu at the chef’s table in front of the kitchen, and enjoy a front row to the precise work of this well-organized kitchen.
The wine list has a few gems, as you would expect in a 2-Michelin-star restaurant, but also an extensive array of up-and-coming winemakers with a distinct emphasis on organic and bio-dynamic productions.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-03-31","2024-03-28","2024-03-28","en","Restaurant Flore","2315768","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r944257405-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"

This team specialises in achieving some of the same textures and mouth experiences as you might expect from a regular meal eg the richness of a “meat” reduction to pair with a “steak” made of aubergine stuffed with vegetables and glazed to perfection. The vibrancy and colours made each dish a delight. An added bonus was being invited to sit at the kitchen table for one of the courses. The wine pairing was inventive, organic and good value. Set meal was EU 185 and wine pairing EU 105, which we felt was extremely fair.

Food: 4","We were not expecting a vegetarian menu!","We were surprised upon arrival when the waiter told us that tonight’s menu was completely vegetarian to celebrate Spring.  The restaurant mentions that it's menu is comprised of sustainable seafood and local vegetables.  That was a disappointment.  We also heard those same sentiments by other diners that evening.  However, the experience was wonderful, and the vegetarian dishes were visually appealing and tasted fresh, but the appearance of Kohlrabi multiple times lended to a bit of monotony in taste, as did the use of fermented yeast foam.  We did thoroughly enjoy our first course of 25 different vegetables at the Chef's table in the kitchen - that was fun and informative. The highlight was the Japanese-inspired chawan-mushi with tempura marigold flowers - that was the only non-vegetarian dish.  My wife had a glass of wine and I opted for the fruit and vegetable nonalcoholic drink pairing, which was interesting, and seemed to match well with each course.  Service was excellent, and the ambiance very serene and calm.  We had a window seat looking onto the canals which was very nice, especially at sunset.  Overall, the food was very attractive and expertly prepared offering many different textures and tastes, and we experienced something new - a vegetarian Michelin star experience.   However, we both left hungry and would have appreciated some seafood or bread - or at least some advance notice that the menu would be vegetarian.   Would  we return?  Probably not for another vegetarian experience but if you are a vegetarian, you might enjoy it immensely.

The decor is no frill, Nordic mordern with botanical charms. 
Staff are beyond courteous and very knowledgeable about their dishes.

We were lucky to visit the kitchen and enjoyed one of our courses there, and chatted with the chef. You can sense his passion towards vegetables,  both via chatting and via tasting his cuisines.

This is a meal that does not make you miss animal proteins at all. You feel refreshingly recharged with every course, with no over-bloated stomach like you would after a multi-course menu at other Michelin Star restaurants.

My most memorable dish of the night was the chawanmushi with the marigold tempura combo. Simple ingredients, well prepared. The chef really knows how to let the freshness of the produce sing.

I look forward to returning in the future for their other seasons and experiencing their hospitality once again.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/0b/0a/d8/caption.jpg

The service from start to finish was immaculate, very friendly but professional. We've been to quite a few michlin restaurants and we have to say this is one of the best. 

The break in between where we could go and dine one of the courses in the kitchen was great too - to see the chefs at work and have a quick convo, very appreciated!","0","","NONE","2023-03-31","2023-03-19","2023-03-19","en","Restaurant Flore","2315768","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r882714841-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html"
