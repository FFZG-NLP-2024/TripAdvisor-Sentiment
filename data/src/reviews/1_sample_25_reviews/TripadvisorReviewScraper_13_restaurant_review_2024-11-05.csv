There is not too much choice, one menue, take it or leave it. However, you will he suprised. It is beyond everyhing I ever had, foodwise. It’s vegetarian, but no worries, even as a meat eater I didn’t miss any kind of meat. 
Meat simply gives not the possibilities they offer here. It offers much more than food, it is an art of cooking and eating for all senses.

It is sensational.

Visually stunning, with superb sunset views over the lakes and mountains.

The presentation of all the food matches the sublime views. 

The smell of the outstanding cuisine is awesome. 

The taste of chef‘s innovative dishes goes beyond expectations. This is plant based cuisine at its finest. There is, however, no need to be vegetarian to be blown away by the sensational dishes that are served here. 

Touch is catered for here as well through clever use of texture throughout the various courses. 

And finally, sound, through the crunchiness and texture again, but also from a very well curated playlist. 

Service is smooth, friendly and professional. 

We paired the sensational seven course menu with the non alcoholic option, which is as tasty as the food itself. 

Chef is a humble genius, who has created a true culinary experience here. To transform honest, often humble ingredients, into such innovative dishes is gastronomic magic. 

A top class restaurant. A must.","0","","FAMILY","2023-05-31","2023-05-13","2023-05-13","en","Magdalena","21325723","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12061917-d21325723-r890197436-Magdalena-Rickenbach.html"

Truly outstanding experience like no other!  Don't be fooled by the 5, 6, or 7 course offering. We chose the 7 course option to fully participate and engage our senses.  The chef keeps you tasting his mini masterpieces beyond these numbers for hours.  The presentation of each dish along with the vibrant taste combinations were beyond words. The element of surprise truly adds to each course and the anticipation of the next makes this overall a very unique experience!  Marco and the other staff were very friendly and interactive making the evening such a pleasure.  I thank my husband but also everyone at Magdalena for making my birthday an extra special day!

How did I find Magdalena? By searching the Michelin website for something innovative in the Swiss territory.
Being Italian, pasta or meat or fish are always present in any kind of meal, so an innovative vegetarian experience geared toward new Swiss culinary creativity clearly appealed to me.
After carefully reading the comprehensive and exhaustive menu, we decided on a seven-course menu with alcohol-free beverage pairings.
To open the dancing, only alcoholic part of our dinner, was a wonderful sparkling wine from biodynamic producer Kluss 177.
This is the only part that I can clearly describe, being the amuse bouche, all seven courses, the pre-dessert, and the ""petit patisserie"" so articulated that it would probably require too many words and knowledge that I certainly do not have.
What to say, then?
Well, the experience started already with a very high level of taste, maintained consistently until the end. Every single course was a perfect balanced mix of ingredients and taste, leaving a mixed feeling of relaxation and amazement, wondering if the next step would be able to surpass the previous one.
And this happened, every time.
Special mention for the cauliflower, which left me totally amazed (I have never been able to enjoy a single piece of cauliflower with pleasure in my entire life), the pre-dessert and the incredible dessert.
The most difficult dish? The ""cheese"", at the time totally unexpected and therefore misunderstood, but coming back to my mind, now perfectly placed in the full picture of this culinary journey.
Very interesting pairing with the soft drinks. I would have liked some tea, but it would not have been too local.
Location? Cozy and casual with a really nice view (not from our table, but we had the couch).
Crew? Young, friendly, knowledgeable and always with the right pace.
Espresso coffee at the end of dinner? They challenged a real Italian, coffee lover...and they were right. Excellent espresso.
Bill? Aligned with the dining experience.
What else can I say? Thank you so much.","0","","NONE","2022-11-30","2022-11-05","2022-11-05","en","Magdalena","21325723","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12061917-d21325723-r867302813-Magdalena-Rickenbach.html"
