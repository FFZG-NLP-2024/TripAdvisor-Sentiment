In addition, perfect beverage selection from Gisela Schneider and a really formidable service. A wonderful evening of enjoyment that we will certainly not forget. And then the perfect sunrise after a comfortable night's sleep in a mega-loft room. Many thanks to everyone for this fantastic feel-good experience.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-12","2024-10-12","en","Terra - The Magic Place","1805979","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g784829-d1805979-r973563551-Terra_The_Magic_Place-Sarentino_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_Alto_Adige.html"

We loved our room of chic design and with a terrace overlooking a piece of grassland.  Room is spotless cleaned.  Comfy bedding and good shower.  We had a dinner in the Michelin restaurant which one shouldn't miss.  Seamless check-in with a sparking wine (in fact any drinks you like) as a welcome drink.  The management is very attentive and caring.  It was my birthday the night we stayed in Terra.  I received a piece of birthday cake next day at breakfast time.  What a surprise (as I didn't mention anything when making reservation)!  Thank you Terra for making my stay an unforgettable one!","0","","NONE","2024-09-30","2024-10-09","2024-10-08","en","Terra - The Magic Place","1805979","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g784829-d1805979-r973163645-Terra_The_Magic_Place-Sarentino_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_Alto_Adige.html"

Reached through a series of hairpin bends you arrive at ‘Terra’ not surprisingly called “The magic place”.... Wonderful location , Relais Chateau with completely eco-sustainable rooms and spa and a restaurant that makes the search for the products of the surrounding environment its workhorse. And we want to talk about his kitchen: 2 Michelin stars and recently deserved green star. Exciting tasting itinerary: a ‘land experience’ that remains etched in the memories of the diner.... The whole gastronomic journey is staggering for research, respect, knowledge, hazards, play.... And Some courses deserve a special mention: mushroom taco, ravioli, veal and wild strawberry dessert symbol of a growing proposal! Earth has everything it takes to be called EXCELLENCE! Here you make peace with yourself and feel pampered! Thank you.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/eb/bf/42/caption.jpg

First, you drive on a small road that climbs through the amazing alpine landscape; when you reach to Terra, you are at the top of the mountain. The place only contains a small number of rooms, which means you have all the privacy you want to look out at the outstanding mountain view of the Dolomites and stars at night. Then, of course, is dinner in the two stars Michelin restaurant – for three hours you will have one of the most unforgettable meals. The local wine selections that accompany the dishes are incredible. The next morning you must take the 3 hour hike to Omini di pietra – the Stone Men site – another magical place with stones likely from medieval period that provides a 360 degree panorama of the Dolomitic mountain peaks in South Tyrol.  The combination of the secluded location, the restaurant, the wine, and the breathtaking panorama view of the Dolomites is memorable. We look forward to coming back!

Sleep Quality: 5","It really is...... The Magic Place!","A dream that we have realized... a magical place that can be reached by climbing from Sarentino to the end of the road. The excitement begins when you get out of the car. Kindness and friendliness above all. The structure is very beautiful with a dozen rooms, ours with a large window overlooking the forest, still covered in snow.
Absolutely nothing is missing.... The wellness area is small but beautiful and welcoming, adequate for the number of guests.
But let's get to the top... dinner. A long and delicious tasting menu, where every single dish deserved the attention of multiple senses... from sight... to aromas... to taste. All accompanied by an excellent wine tasting proposed by Mrs. Gisela.
Our first experience in a ** star hotel and we were able to understand and appreciate the research, the study, the work that brings incredible dishes to the table!
Much attention also for my celiac wife.
The gourmet breakfast is also excellent with dishes and ingredients of the highest quality.
A big thank you also to all the staff, very professional and kind who made us feel truly pampered.
How can you not return to such a magical place? Until we meet again......","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-25","2024-03-25","en","Terra - The Magic Place","1805979","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g784829-d1805979-r943792103-Terra_The_Magic_Place-Sarentino_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_Alto_Adige.html"

The rooms are new, elegant, clean and with that touch of personality that makes the atmosphere warm and never aseptic.
You can also use the spa area which is truly a gem. The hydromassage tub overlooking a wonderful landscape makes everything more magical, the saunas and relaxation area really gave me an afternoon of comfort away from the commitments and stress of the week.
The welcome and care that the hosts put into managing and taking care of the guests' stay is impeccable and truly rare.

Then you get to the top and are greeted by  smiling, friendly people. A structure immersed in the woods. Everything inside is clean and new, recently renovated and still smells of wood
The room is large with large windows overlooking the woods and you are immediately pervaded by a feeling of calm and serenity. The wellness center is a gem and the hydromassage tub is its centerpiece: you can enjoy a spectacular view of the Dolomites while you are immersed in the warmth of the water illuminated by chromatic lamps. Everything is truly taken care of down to the smallest detail - Gisela and Heinrich Schneider, the owners, are people dedicated to their business and you can see and feel that they put their soul into it. They take care of everything personally: she ranges from reception to restaurant service and is an expert sommelier, her brother is an excellent, very creative chef who creates delicious starred dishes. Nice to know that they have lived in this enchanting place since their childhood and that with the relais they wanted to make their mother's dream come true

What else to add? An unforgettable experience
