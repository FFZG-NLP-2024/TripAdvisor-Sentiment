Food: 1","Beware of this tourist trap and disappointing restaurant. Waste of money!","I told our waiter I would not leave a review, but I must warn others to stay away from tourist trap “La Table d’Hôtes”. I anticipate they will reply to this as they do to other negative reviews by placing the blame on one’s expectations with no accountability or offer to make anything better. There's no room to complain in the experience because you are sitting with ten strangers; we didn't want to ruin anyone's evening by being upset in front of them or abruptly leaving; I waited to complain until we were paying. The waiter did not apologize.

My husband and I live in the San Francisco area and have eaten at many Michelin and fine dining establishments, both in the US and abroad. I speak and understand some French, my husband does not, but I do not think that being fluent would have changed our poor experience.

First of all, I wish to be quite clear that this review is about the high-end La Table d’Hôtes, and not the brasserie upstairs. These restaurants being combined here is misleading.

When we arrived, the host confused our reservation and sat us at the brasserie, where we sat for awhile, unattended, before someone else came to our table, informed us a mistake had been made, and that we were supposed to be downstairs.

Our waiter had an unkempt appearance, with a wrinkled uniform and a gaudy name tag that seemed all very casual for a meal that would ultimately top 500€ for us.

The sommelier, in an equally unkempt polo and name tag (similar to McDonalds uniforms) who could not pour a pairing-size pour consistently all night with very little understanding of basic wine service etiquette, glasses on people’s lefts, rights, and not even all pre-set at the table when we sat down. There was a miscommunication and she thought my husband and I were sharing the pairing, which was corrected when she came back and gave my husband and I comically large pours. She proceeded to give us both extra booze all night because I think she wanted to get us drunk and thought we were uncultured Americans.

The pairing (75€ pp) featured the cheapest wines from top producers. It featured entirely white wines, with the exception of one red, which was a disappointment.

After the unimaginative appetizer of bread and butter, we were put on a video conference with Etchebest after watching a short, trailer for the restaurant. It was a strange, reality TV show experience.

The first course was where my path began to diverge due to my allergies, which - to the restaurant’s credit - were handled well. My husband was presented with a fried oyster, and a mollusk paste that resembled imitation crab. I got a burnt piece of root vegetable with a horrible combination of flavors in a foam. We ate, hoping it could get better.

Then, a tepid and salty mushroom soup.

Next, a small slice of tasteless foie gras enveloped in a brioche covering with a passion fruit sauce. It looked nothing like a recent picture of this dish that the restaurant posted on social media.

The fourth course was another diversion for me; I received two large pieces of a veal chop that were out of proportion with the fish that was presented to the other guests. My veal was cold, tough and dry. My husband’s fish was unseasoned and accompanied by inedible mussels that most people pushed around their plates.

The final main course was duck à l’orange, which may have been the only dish I may describe from our experience as tasty.

The two dessert courses were simply bad. A salted crumble with olives and chocolate mousse, accompanied by what I can only describe as a martini slushie. Then the final straw was a rancid burrata served with rocket and underripe strawberries.

Dining near the kitchen was noisy and underwhelming. I pity these young chefs who think they are achieving something by working under this self-important little man Etchebest.

The scratched Christofle silverware was a gimmick.

It certainly was a night at the opera, where one watched the performance of a dining establishment crash the lowest expectations. I'm embarrassed of our waste of time and money.","3","","COUPLES","2023-07-31","2023-07-17","2023-07-16","en","La Table D’Hotes","17396510","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r903607929-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

-Extremely long service on inconfortable chairs 
-way much food (7 meals) 
-10 people on 1 table = no privacy in a very small space, don’t go if you are uncomfortable in narrow spaces and if you want to experience a cozy and intimate evening. 

But most of all :

Allergies / specifics announced at reservations were not respected. 
We asked for explanations the day after and the explanations were : « we agree there was a mistake on our side but as you did not said anything during the evening, it was deduced it was fine ». 

For a meal at 255€/ person, this is not satisfying at all and not up to the height and standards you would expect a 1 star Michelin to be.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/26/de/31/8c/caption.jpg

Food: 3","Not as good as expected","We anticipated an amazing experience at this very special place, but unfortunately it was disappointing.  
First, I want to mention this experience is not suited for non-French speaking clients, and it would have been better if this information was noted as we booked this reservation.  The only person able to provide equal explanation in English as in French was the sommelier. 
The experience is very long and feels dragged out.  We were promptly seated at 7:15 pm for dinner and did not have the first course served until 8:15.  The subsequent 4 courses were prepared and served more timely, until about 10:45 pm.  Then, the main chiefs left and we waited for another 45 minutes for pastry chiefs to serve the first dessert, followed by the second.  Right before midnight, we asked for the check, because we just had to leave.  
The food itself was very well prepared and presented.  The asparagus, mushroom and foie gras were amazing, the fish was ok and we did not like the octopus course at all. The chocolate dessert was excellent.  The wines were mediocre, less than what we expected in this level restaurant, especially in Bordeaux.  
This is quite pricey, and the expectation of special chiefs table concept is wonderful, if it would be executed properly.  The chairs are metal and not comfortable, especially sitting on them for 5 hours.  This whole experience would be much more enjoyable if it would take 3-4 hours and need to have better chairs and better wine.  Detailed explanations in English would help to attract non-French speakers.
I would not recommend this and would not do this again.","2","","NONE","2022-05-31","2022-05-15","2022-05-15","en","La Table D’Hotes","17396510","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r838625686-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Each dish is finished in front of us, showing some of the technicality.
The catch is that too often there was a gap between the dish (lacking flavors) and the sides. Only 2 courses (out of 7) gave us pleasure, grilled octopus Basque condiment and elder sabayon, and cryogenic nougat pear soup.
When discussing with the other guests, they were unanimous on grilled octopus and nougat, remaining divided on the rest of the meal.
Picasso tomato (very graphic) to sauce with a brioche (very good) but unfortunately not accompanied by the flavors of the graphic plate.
The mushroom pennes again very technical but the winey and alcoholic taste of yellow wine spoils the dish.
The blue lobster cooked in salt vapour (minute cooking with Noilly Prat, very spectacularly), unfortunately not enough raised by a fish soup bouillabaisse style, the accompaniment offset from the dish but connected with the theme of Marseille, Ricard ice cream accompanied by peanuts and chips in the shape of a sardine bone...
In short I would have liked less show and more flavors and emotion.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-13","2024-10-13","en","La Table D’Hotes","17396510","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r973699074-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html"

Relaxed and efficient service 

A small table
Back to the kitchen to see the cooks

Unprecedented experience of sharing your table with strangers and being able to talk with the chefs who realize the dressage and show techniques (you can participate)

Regional products highlighted with a mixture of originality and classicism 

A very good time with special mention for the mushroom dish (top chef) and octopus 

The imperatives of taste and argües were taken into account 

Reasonable Award for a star (those who find it expensive can go to paris or compare with trendy restaurants)

We were afraid of a marketing side TV but even if we saw the chef Etchebest that in visio c is really good gastro cuisine

The chef is free to surprise us, we were surprised by the creation, the flavors and also we surprised ourselves by loving foods that we say we do not like on a daily basis….
The moment is great, in simplicity a form of complicity begins with the chef, the sommelier and the head waiter assigned to our table….
The riddles about the dishes, the aromas, the wine pairing….we had a great time as a family
A big thank-you","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/24/af/67/caption.jpg

We are far, very far from the kitchen nightmare.
It's a waking dream 🌟
The dishes offered are all as succulent as each other, the service is impeccable and the cooking demonstrations incredible.
We had the chance to meet chef Etchebest!
