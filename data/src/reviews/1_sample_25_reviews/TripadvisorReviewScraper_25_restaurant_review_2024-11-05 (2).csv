Tears of happiness, satisfaction and gratitude. 4 hours of rhythm, rhythm, sense… Dishes made with a 0 km product that envelop the diner from chapter 1.

OBA- has been a pleasant surprise that has moved us and convinced us that this young team has the desire, knowledge and ability to make anyone who tries their food fall in love. I don't have anything negative to say about the attention, quite the opposite. Helpful, professional, close and pleasant. We have been like at home. The absolute 10.

To highlight, the excellent service and kindness of the team, both in the living room and in the kitchen. You can see the dedication, commitment and pride in what they do.
The presentation of each dish, accompanied by a notebook where we are told the chapter of the experience in which we are about to delight.
The pairing, with extraordinary ferments obtained by Nico, a true Alchemist.
It has been wonderful, at times we were left speechless.
As a suggestion, they could change the music for something that better accompanied the experience, since at one point it became very monotonous, even boring.

Surprising flavors, dishes with two stars or more.

We wanted to go from the star but the distance has prevented us from going sooner.
It has exceeded all expectations, we already knew the Cañitas restaurant but Oba at the top with only 4 tables is worth putting a monument to.
17 passes, 3 and a half hours of experience, several preparations in each dish and many finished at the table. What a front-of-house team, it has been a long time since we felt so well cared for, great professionals with Javier Redondo as Head of Room and David Gallego as sommelier. And in the kitchen Juan and the rest of the cooks are completely integrated and with very controlled times.
Great dishes that are impossible to list, a staging that we haven't seen in a long time. They deserve the 2nd ⭐️ ⭐️ since this level is not available to many who already have it.
