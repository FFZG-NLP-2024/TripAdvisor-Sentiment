Atmosphere: 5","Try out the Kuzukulağı cocktail","There isn't much to say about Od Urla except that it truly deserves its reputation. I opted for the tasting menu, which was a delightful journey through local flavors skillfully blended into modern recipes. The staff was very attentive, although I noticed that the executive and sous chefs seemed more focused on the tables of the celebrities dining alongside us. Perhaps next time, we can also receive a greeting from the chefs.

While I found it to be overpriced, it is definitely an experience worth having at least once in a lifetime. I particularly loved the kuzukulağı cocktail, which was rich in flavor and showcased the freshness of its ingredients beautifully.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-10-06","2024-10-06","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r972761205-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

The main reasons that no more will go there is that Mr J8 took the orders, charging « a la carte » instead of using the set menus & provided none professionals comments to the waiters (we heard & understood) to maximize our bill. 
Definitely Mr Hakan that we knew before was more professional and this kind of behavior will only negatively impact this place.
Last, menus are the same (2 years) and you will get borrowed quickly. + most of the dishes were delivered cold.

You have to keep in mind when you focus only on commercial objectives and develop bad behaviors that by the end you will lose your DNA which is already the case.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-09-04","2024-09-04","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r968261066-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

The whole meal process feels sumptuous and decadent.  You can buy olive oil tastings and choose bread (if we knew it was coming we’d have done our cheese plate later), you have a couple of amuse bouches and then we did the ala carte prix fixe, sharing dishes.  Local wines and cheeses complemented the experience.
The food though often missed the mark.  The smoked okra lacked flavor and swam in one note hummus, the shrimp in tangerine sauce was also one sweet note.  The oxtail seemed to be dry and missing all flavor. Often the dishes felt like there were too many sauces and too rich, while lacking flavor pop.  The entrees were the best, the lamb was flavorful and the chicken with corn pudding was the nights highlight for me.  Deserts summed it up as we couldn’t,  or didn’t, want to eat more than a few bites.  At almost $200/person after a couple of drinks, this really isn’t good enough.","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-10","2024-07-10","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r958840023-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

Beautiful settings in the garden. Most of the fresh ingredients from their garden. Every dish was delicious. We had wine from the Urla region. Again, perfect combination with the foods. The only negative side was, during the reservation process, they asked if we have a kid, which we don't.  Because they are not accepting families with small children. It is understandable  for this kind of setup. But when we arrived and seated, forget the children,  there were even babies:)) anyway, I think they changed their rules.

Our main course was served with little to no explanation, a stark contrast to the meticulous descriptions of past visits. The coordination between serving food and drinks was noticeably lacking, disrupting our dining experience. When I addressed this issue, a visibly uncomfortable and rushed cook was sent to our table, which did not improve our experience but rather detracted from it.

I understand that the restaurant industry has had its fair share of challenges due to the pandemic, but I believe that top-notch customer service and unique dining experiences should remain the cornerstone, especially considering the premium pricing of Od Urla.

Based on our recent experience, I find it difficult to recommend Od Urla to others. I miss the charm and service level this place used to have and I genuinely hope they work to regain it. Until then, I'll be exploring other dining options.","1","","FRIENDS","2023-05-31","2023-05-26","2023-05-26","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r892011982-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

I have had the pleasure of hosting business and family guests in several occasions and can say that his is THE place to host the perfect dinner. 
Highlights;
1) the booking experience, hassle free and easy
2) OD offers transfer pick ups for regular guests. A must if you plan on having some wine as Urla is notorious for police checkpoints and there is no taxi stops nearby (even though the restaurant is happy to organise a taxi). Being driven around in a Mercedes EV is ofc a treat… great thinking Merca and the OD management. 
2) Arrival, top class organising and greeting…
3) Food, authentic with a twist. Even the top restaurants in Istanbul (and Europe) rarely comes close…
4) the service is simply impeccable. In a period where establishments are having a hard time keeping seasoned and experienced staff, OD somehow manages to maintain highly skilled staff with a huge smile on their faces. 

In short, a big thank you to the management but to the staff for turning each of my previous 5-6 visits to a tries experience.","0","","FAMILY","2022-09-30","2022-09-10","2022-09-10","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r859461172-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

But it seems that the restaurant has began to believe in its own publicity.  Service was avarege.  The food generally good but not exceptional.  The desert offer was poor. Whats annoyed us was having chosen an award winning red Mozaik wine , we were told that it was full of tanens and the "" somelier"" suggested something else and of course at a high price. 
We thought the wine list was good but seriously over priced.  We also decided to buy at the Mozaik wineyard and try the Mozaik wine we wanted to drink. There were no tanens in this 2012 beauty ?! 
We can only assume that the somelier was Just pushing high margin wines for greater profit.

It is in a secluded place surrounded by olive trees and mini garden where chef (who is also the owner) grows some of the vegetables there. The ambiant is super nice chic but not extravagant i.e it is a place for people appreciate good good not for people who wants to show off. The food was amazing. We took tasting menu and ordered few extra dishes seperately to share 3 people. They have also their own wines which was amazing. As a starter, we also took nice coctails called “kuzu kulagi” I am posting with delay but we visited the restaurant in 2020 August","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/1e/83/fd/caption.jpg

Amazing food. Tasting menu is so original and every single course was delicious. Service was perfect. The ambiance is not like another - you can sit outside amongst olive trees and all the other herbs, greens and flowers that they are growing in the garden. A perfect wine menu with a generous selection of Turkish wines and others. Can’t recommend enough.","0","","FRIENDS","2022-07-31","2022-07-10","2022-07-10","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r847140003-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

-Great setting for a restaurant nestled inside an olive grove, service was punctual, the descriptions by the cook staff was to the point and appreciated. 
-Loved the OD URLA marked ice cubes in cocktails.  
-I asked for a favor and they made me a Bourbon Sour which tasted great. 
-I also really like the OD URLA’s own medium bodied red wine.
-Tour of the cellar was great, really impressive selection of wines/champagnes from all over the world and the sommelier was both knowledgeable and fun. 

Negatives:
-There should be either more bathrooms for the ladies or all bathrooms should be marked unisex.
-Music can make or break a restaurant and Kenny G. can easily break you at any location :)
-We had the tasting menu. There is no reason that there should be 4 forks and 4 knives placed next to my plate. With all the servers they have, forks and knives should arrive with each course. 
-Just way too many employees working. At one point I counted 18 cooks at the open kitchen :) most of them idle.
-I am not sure what the seating capacity is but it felt crowded, tables very close to each other, at times felt like I was at a cafe :(
-About the tasting menu; repetitive, both in terms of presentation and taste. I liked the SAR-MA, the mozzarella appetizer, grilled fish and the lamb shank. I can’t even remember what the dessert was. The red pepper sorbet is not my favorite. I would have loved lavender, rosemary or pine nut instead but that’s just me. 
-I was really looking forward to the pasta dish. Even though it tasted OK, pasta was overcooked :(

Will I go back? Yes, probably. 
I would limit my food choices and enjoy the wine/cocktail service and the surroundings.","2","","NONE","2022-06-30","2022-07-01","2022-07-01","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r845622861-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"

It was a nice experience although a little disappointed for the huge crowd. We were expecting a more cozy restaurant instead of a huge place with many tables. Actually we ate the whole menu, and liked each one of them. A little disappointed with the desert. Overall, totally worth it.","0","","NONE","2022-05-31","2022-06-17","2022-06-17","en","OD Urla","16659039","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r843240386-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html"
