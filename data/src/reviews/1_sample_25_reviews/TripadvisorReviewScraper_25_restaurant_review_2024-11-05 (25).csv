You can see a lot of thought is given to every aspect of the meal but I would argue the appearance of everything takes precedence over the taste of the food. 

The non alcoholic pairing was enjoyable with different juices, kombuchas and teas. 

Everything is played beautifully, the interior of the restaurant is visually pleasing too. However, taste is a crucial part of a tasting menu and unfortunately this fell VERY short for us.  all of the dishes are very vinegary and they made a big spectacle about using scoby (the mushroom on top of kombucha) as they key ingredient in a few dishes and it is actually pretty foul.  Also,  upon reflection the service felt overbearing at times. 

This isn’t about eating tasty enjoyable food, it’s about pushing boundaries and I appreciate that to a certain degree but it’s definitely not for everyone. 
There are much more enjoyable food experiences to be had in Copenhagen. If you missed out getting a reservation, I wouldn’t worry.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/45/20/89/caption.jpg

René Redzepi, the founder and head chef of Noma, is considered an influential chef in the world (see the notes in the same category for personal experience) and was selected as the cover character of Time magazine in 2012. His influence on Nordic cooking covers five Nordic countries, such as the newly promoted three-star Michelin restaurant Jordnær and the one-star Michelin restaurant Dill in Iceland.
In addition, as a restaurant itself, it has won numerous awards, and the most notable one is that it was ranked first in the list five times in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2021.
At the end of 2016, René Redzepi decided to close the restaurant and move it to a new location. He felt that the restaurant was a bit stagnant and the team needed to innovate further, which was a big risk and controversy for the award-winning chef. Fortunately, the new Noma 2.0 has received positive reviews from almost all critics around the world since its opening, including but not limited to The LA Times, The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal. 
Scandina-vian cooking methods are derived from their traditions, such as the Vikings' need to use methods such as preservation, drying, smoking, salting, and pickling to ensure that they can survive the long winter, and this tradition continues to this day.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/ef/5b/2e/caption.jpg

At the restauraunt food may be a hit or a miss, but the service always makes up for it. What terrible  service- you can refill my water better when my glass is empty, micro portions of wine parings, the pained  look on the waiters face if he has to refill wine or even juice. Mixing up glasses at the table and not even understanding / rectifying it. Food which is complicated for the sake of being complicated. Essence of a dish is lost. The entire meal had only one spice note.

Left the place hungry and got a fantastic hotdog near the trains station .

Knew it would be mediocre but never expected it to be downright terrible. 

Can understand why it is drawing comparisons to the movie - The menu on Netflix .

Paying nearly 1000 usd for dinner - I understand I am the fool","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/a3/20/dd/caption.jpg

The 14 courses were too much, 8-10 of them would have been sufficient. Less could have been more.

The drink pairing included some pretty average wines, one of them being quite bad. There was no proper presentation of the wine, e.g. why there were chosen to pair those 2-3 courses, fir which they were offered. It seemed a bit ad hoc. And very expensive for the quality.

The service was very efficient, but still not very personal, except for being offered some pretty average cocktails at the end for not so average prices.

I expected to experience a similar magic as at the Fat duck, but it wasn't even nearly close. Much more expensive though.

I left the restaurant dissapointed and so did my wife. It was a wrong choice for us.","2","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-03","2024-02-03","en","Noma","694971","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r936746929-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

The food, wine and service were impeccable.

The wild boar belly was one of the best items of food I have ever eaten in my life.

We were looked after by Ming who was a breath of fresh air, attentive, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. She was able to answer all of our questions and even took us on a tour of the kitchens after we had finished. We were here for lunch service and had the full tasting menu and wine flight. 

It was a truly memorable experience and one that was uniquely its own, completely different to every other 3* Michelin place we have been but could hold its own despite its classic approach and being less theatrical than other places in the same arena.

We are so glad we managed to get a booking for this season giving im not really a seafood eater and the restaurant is set to close soon.

Thanks so much for a wonderful afternoon","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/31/fc/05/caption.jpg

Courtesy of a dear someone who seems to be a reservation ninja, I was able to eat at a shared table. The place is gorgeous and the setting quaint. Service is friendly and attentive, i.e., 3 star worthy. The food, however, was a huge letdown. The vegetable menu was just not enough to satiate a child. The main was a single mushroom (!). Some of the flavors were plain odd. Mind you, I know my food. Just look at all my other reviews. The wine pairing was exotic. But exotic does not mean good either. Some drops were good, others tasted like cat p*ss. I feel arrogance has creeped into the experience. The chef resting on his laurels has decided to make a mockery of diners it seems. While I do appreciate the art of making amazing food, it also has to be good. And this, unfortunately was a bit of a hit and miss. Go ahead noma, close down sooner than later. Make space for more passionate chefs who actually want to wow their diners with flavors and not ""concepts.""","5","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/4a/59/91/caption.jpg

Quite an experience. Some of the dishes were quite outstanding but I’m not blown away, sadly. Still worthy of 5 stars for creativity, presentation and for those 5-6 mindblowing dishes. 
Wine: Bottle of Domaine de Chassorney - Saint Romain. On point. BdB champagne to start with. Excellent. Glass of top Chenin to round off the night. Suggested by the Sommelier. Really happy that they did not push the wine menu although some of the wines on the menu on offer seemed quite interesting. 
Service: Relaxed. Too relaxed for my taste but friendly, polite and welcoming.
Experience: beautiful location, amazing entrance, original interior, good development in the menu. You feel like you’re visiting an institution without feeling alienated. Very unique. I see this as a once in a lifetime experience. Happy to have tried Noma but not eager to go back.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/db/08/f9/caption.jpg

A true multisensory experience - from the greenhouses set in nature, to the light filled wooden architecture, to the open interaction between the kitchen and the diners 

Unexpected was the natural, genuine humour and honesty of the waiting staff, of whom we met many throughout the courses 

If this vegetable season menu needed any more superlatives than have already been written, it was a super-natural-fresh, sensory comfort zone expanding joyride - all presented on humble, impeccably crafted plates, bowls and cutlery

All was bookended with a welcoming tour of the kitchen and labs, greeted by the teams who have given their life to this place - may hundreds of careers be launched post-Noma","1","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-07-19","2023-07-19","en","Noma","694971","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r904220207-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

The menu reads as if designed to be as impactful & memorable. From reindeer's heart, brains and penis, it is certainly a meal to write home about. Whilst it delivered on presentation and conception, it fell short on flavour and texture (except reindeer’s heart which was masterful in preparation). Service is perplexing but not offensive - steely cold vibe mixed in with some informal humour. The wine pairing is underwhelming. I would be back if I didn’t have to jump thru hoops and someone shouting dinner.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/0b/10/b3/caption.jpg

The whole experience right from when you are greeted at the door, to the story, presentation of the food, the service  and decor and of course, the food, is world class. 
We had the forest and game season which had pretty much used all the edible parts of the deer, plus bear fat, and duck.  The wine pairing was the best I've ever tasted.
Worth the anticipation, worth the price.  We are hoping to get a spot at their Tokyo pop up.","1","","FRIENDS","2022-12-31","2023-01-01","2023-01-01","en","Noma","694971","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r873529993-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

There was always personal attention on the costumers, if you just dine or have been at the rest room, you will be seated and waited all time, the chefs present the food themself and the waiters has so much control and understanding of all aspects of the environment, food, drinks and what we have.
Will definitive come back again some time.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/9f/ea/34/caption.jpg
