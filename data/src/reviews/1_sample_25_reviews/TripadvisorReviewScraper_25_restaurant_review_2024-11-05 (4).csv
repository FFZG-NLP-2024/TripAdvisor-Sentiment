Atmosphere: 5","From a Unique Experience to a Sad, Hurried, Unqualified, Untrustworthy 'Drive-Thru' Ending","We went there to enjoy the last meal of our honeymoon, and that was the last bodega on our schedule. As it is known for being a must-see in Mendoza, we couldn't let the experience be overshadowed by other bodegas, so we left Casa Vigil as the cherry-on-top of our trip.

It was all going pretty well. We were served great wines at the entrance, and the explanations given were very interesting from the start. Bear in mind we arrived around 2:30 pm; this is important.

We sat inside, as all the other tables outside were already occupied because it was a blue sky day and the sun was so comforting, and that's fine.

We asked for the 3-step menu, and I literally cried when I took my first bite of the entrée. The flavor and attention to all the elements of the dish were astonishing. We also ordered a 3-wine pairing since we wanted to just try the wines because we drank too much at the bodega before Vigil. We then ate the main course, and it was as delicious as I expected.

The servings are quite large, so we took some time before asking for dessert and asked the waiter, Horacio (which is also important to note since he was our waiter from the beginning until this moment and we had great service with him), if we could go out and take some photos. He said that was no problem at all. We stood up and went outside to check the sculptures and decorations, took several photos, and enjoyed some musicians playing with other Brazilian customers. It was indeed a great moment.

We then saw Horacio, who was accompanied by a group of people, probably starting a tour of the place, next to the reception. We stood there for a while for a hear, but he asked us to wait for the next tour that would happen in about 15 minutes. However, we were inclined to sit again and order dessert, so we did.

Now all the sadness, rush, and bad service started.

We were received at the table by a woman unbeknownst to us until then since we knew Horacio was on a tour, which made sense. But she started by saying something like, ""We didn't know where you were! We thought you'd left,"" like, why would I do this? Strange, to begin with. Don't they communicate with each other about the customers wanting to go outside and take pictures? But OK.

We sat, and the desserts were served, but not in the tranquil mood we had before. The waitress seemed to be in a rush to serve us the desserts and kept looking at us like we had to eat fast. There were people cleaning tables, and we guessed that they were preparing for dinner. This was around 4:30 pm. We finished our desserts calmly, just as we did with all the other courses. We paired them with the wines, and just after she saw we finished, she asked to take the plates away. OK then...

Almost every minute after that she kept asking if we wanted anything else, but I just ate, i wanted to check the menu, but not that time. And she did this like two or three times and we were then offered the bill. We hadn't finished drinking, nor had we had the opportunity to check the menu for anything else. We weren't properly advised that we had to leave because the kitchen would close, nor was there anything written or said that implied we should leave before 5 pm or something, but she brought the bill anyway, even though I didn't ask for it.

It was our last day, and paying in Argentina is not that simple, even more so after an expensive experience. While I was checking my bank account to make sure my card would go through smoothly, she appeared again asking what the payment method would be. I was still checking my stuff, and she came back less than 30 seconds after bringing the bill I didn't ask for.

We still had wine in our glasses; we hadn't finished our experience! What happened to cause this sudden change in behavior? I told her I needed more time, as I was still checking my accounts and finishing my wine, and she kind of rolled her eyes and said that we needed to come pay with her at the tienda, where the POS was.

What? Is this how one ends their Michelin experience? Bringing the bill without being asked, not being advised of the schedule or kitchen closing times? Being rushed to pay even though I hadn't finished the wine I paid for?

All went from wine to degraded vinegar when I was almost escorted by her to the tienda to pay, and she kept looking at me while I was paying. She said something like, ""I have to stay here to make sure of the payment,"" or something like this.

After the card went through, she thanked me and apologized. I was shocked at how bad this experience ended. Was I going to flee the cashier? What was she thinking when she was ""making sure"" of my payment?

I ended up crying in front of my wife. I didn't want our honeymoon to end on such a bad note. We were treated extremely well at the beginning, only to end in a hurry and be treated as untrustworthy by the waitress.

I asked to see the manager, and he wanted to give us some glasses of wine in exchange for the inconvenience, but I refused, as I believe this is not the way to address a problem like this. Instead, the importance of what I was telling him should be acknowledged, and steps should be taken to prevent such issues for future clients. He seemed like someone who didn't care enough to deeply analyze the situation and just wanted to get around the problem, not face it.

This is an honest review of a complete experience, and I hope it improves for future customers. They should explain their schedules better and not rush people out of such a prestigious restaurant, leaving them feeling guilty for taking too long to eat or feeling they wouldn't pay the bill...","1","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-13","2024-06-13","en","Casa Vigil","10056473","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312781-d10056473-r954969379-Casa_Vigil-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html"

While the hospitality, service and ambience were great, it lacked a great food and wine delivery.

There was very little explanation given of the wines. I would have liked more of an explanation of the different grape varietals and the wine regions where they were procured. The waiter simply poured the predetermined samples and told us we could choose our favorite to have with our meal, which didn’t end up being the case.

For my entree I ordered the gnocchi, which wasn’t made in the traditional way. They were plated as potato balls and I was disappointed by this modern conceptualization of gnocchi.

The outdoor setting, plus the guitarist, plus the (fairly) attentive weight staff were all positives. But nothing could make up for the poor food and wine.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/c8/a1/62/caption.jpg

The serving team made it all personal.
For example, deep into a 2 1/2-hour meal, with four reds and a white or two sampled, I asked what was the vineyard’s best vintage. The quick response: 2012.
Do you have any, I asked. The server responded with a tentative “give me a minute” gesture before disappearing. He returned in about 10 minutes with a 2012 red and a gesture of presentation. I apologized for putting him to the trouble given my presumption it was beyond my monetary pain threshold. Do not worry, he said. There will be no extra charge. “This is help you remember Casa Vigil fondly.” And then he refilled the glasses of our party of four and offered still more when the initial serving was consumed.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c4/6a/22/caption.jpg

We booked the table for dinner, as Casa Vigil was described as one of the best places in the vicinity of Mendoza. The ten-course dinner is too much food to really enjoy. One of the appetizers burned my lips as it was improperly prepared—this should not happen in a Michelin restaurant. The wine pairing was unimpressive. The service seemed impersonal, with the staff reciting what they memorized about the wine and the dishes. The place lacked atmosphere. For the price of US$130/person and a Michelin restaurant one would expect much better experience.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-21","2024-03-21","en","Casa Vigil","10056473","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312781-d10056473-r943318953-Casa_Vigil-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html"

Not to be missed","The bodega was stunning.   Unfortunately we did the tour at 7:30pm and it was cold so we did cut the tour a little short but then we did a 7 course tasting menu which was out of this world.  The wines were all amazing   And the dining room was great.  The only thing I would have like maybe a little bit dimmer to set a nice evening mood.  Our server Alexandra or she mentioned she also goes by Alex was superb.  She explained every course and was extremely gracious.  Our sommelier Thomas (not sure is I’m spelling it right) was extremely knowledgeable of all the wines and desiring each wine and the notes of the wine.  He truly helped us enjoyed every course.  It was the best service I have received in quite a long time.  We left feeling like we had made some lifelong friends.   A definite MUST    Not to be missed.  You should book this as your last stop and meal because it will leave the best experience for last.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/28/da/85/caption.jpg

We came with an 18-month-old toddler, 40 min early (thanks weird toddler sleep), and with grand aspirations for a tasting - and they over delivered. 

- Took care of us with a glass of wine and early seating, way before our reservation
- Gave us the best-possible table for a toddler (outside, mostly away from others, under a beautiful olive tree). (Note: I’m not sure there’s a bad table in the house. They’re super diverse - inside, outside, in corners, under alcoves - and kind of all awesome in their own right.)
- The service was exceptional. Everyone was incredibly friendly, despite toddler shenanigans. Great vibes, great recommendations, attentive (despite us being out in a corner), just top tier. 
- Food was really great. My ojo de bife is one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. Other weekends were solid-plus, no misses but no other spikes. 
- We went big with the wine - doing the Single Vineyard pairing. It was a splurge, and suuuuper expensive, but (a) the wine was amazing, and (b) they really make it worthwhile - you won’t go wanting for wine. Zero regrets. 

Overall: despite this being a giant machine of a place (170 tables?!) it felt intimate, the food and wine were great, the service was extraordinary, and the vibe was impeccable. Strongly recommend.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/af/ad/fd/caption.jpg
