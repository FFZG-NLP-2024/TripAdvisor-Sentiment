Atmosphere: 5","There is a reason to be awarded 3 Michelin stars","It is “usually” once in a life time experience. Make reservation way in advance, save money (lot of it) and be prepared to the amazing journey and experience of almost 5 hours. 
The seasonal tasting menu (11 courses) with extra signature dishes is what we tried and loved. 
I highly recommend the rarity wine pairing, both the Nebbiolo and the champagne…… the food is PERFECT but the Wine will exceed your expectations as it is very rare and meticulously picked, not to match the food, but to enjoy usually in between courses for the full appreciation of the wine selected. 
Service: the best you can get in Italy…..
To be greeted by the chef himself and take pictures with him and while signing your menu, is just an added bonus to an excellent experience.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/bc/ed/aa/caption.jpg

Giuseppe, the maitre d’, was rude and totally not professional. Another guest got up from her table and was having a cell phone call for several minutes a foot from where I was sitting. We asked if he could ask her to take her call in another place and he said no, he could not do anything about it. I asked her if she could continue her call somewhere else, she immediately apologized and finished her call in the lobby.

Crippa was a former Marchesi alumni and worked during his career with Michael Bras, Ferran Adrià (just to name a few) and in Japan, which all had an important step in his career, this is well reflected in his food but also in the decoration of the restaurant. 

Everything could be characterized by a perfect juxtaposition of balance while still challenging the diners' expectations. Ingredients are of best quality, locally sourced and perfectly executed. Crippa is managing to elevate simple ingredients to an explosion of flavors. My favorite dish? The Borscht soup, amazing!

The wait was perfect, engaging without distracting from the food, very knowledgeable, and worked together as a seamless team perfectly.

The overall experience is a journey in the unexpected. Simply a masterclass in food as an art.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/b8/49/b5/caption.jpg

Service exemplary.","This was our third visit to this outstanding restaurant, however instead of gorging ourselves on the large degustation we opted for the four course luncheon degustation for Euro130-00 per head. There was a choice of an optional dish (at an extra cost of from Euro20-00 to Euro40-00) from four dishes and you could also do wine pairing for Euro90-00 each.

This restaurant is on the first floor of a building that overlooks the Piazza Duomo and has its entrance off a small side street. the Vicolo dell'Arco. The interior is modern and chic with pink walls. 

Our four course luncheon degustation started out with nine amuse bouche/starters There followed our additional option dish called Salad 21..31..41..51 (Euro40-00 each) that amazingly had over 80 different salad ingredients. After a short break we started the main menu with Codfish, almond and lavender, zucchini and clams, followed by Rooibos risotto, Duck breast Marrakech and for dessert, Yoghurt and honey. Interesting coffee and tea menu (Coffees Euro10-00 each). Coffee came with 6 different petit fours each. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish, the range of which really set tested the taste buds. Some dishes better than others but not a miss amongst them.

Wine list was a tome. Our bottle of 2018 Barolo from E Pira & Figli was Euro150-00 and excellent.

Service was exceptional. Staff were attentive and explained all of the dishes well.

As we left we met the genius behind it all, Enrico Crippi.

This is fine dining at its best though it is not cheap. Two aperitifs of sparkling wine (Euro32-00), lunch, additional salad option, two bottles of water, wine and two coffees came to Euro572-00.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/13/0a/8d/full-degustation-menu.jpg

Our party of 4 thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu with accompanying wine pairings. There is something to satisfy every palate and the chef was very accommodating with respect to dietary restrictions (let them know when you make the reservation). 
The tasting menu has 8 courses, plus an amuse Bouche and bonus dessert. Portion sizes are appropriate for the number of courses, so that one can enjoy all of the items without feeling overwhelmed.
While it is hard to pick highlights, for me the standouts were the “antipasto piemontese” and the “Gavour”. We also added their signature dish, the “Salad 21,31,41,51…”

it is a 3 starred restaurant so expectations are high (this is our 4th 3 stars restaurant).

A bit disturbing to be placed on a list to be admitted and giving credit card in advance... (we have already experienced he same at Gordon Ramsey years ago, but we cannot appreciate it...)

To be clear: it's a very good place with high levels of services and cousine, but in this palce every details counts.
We ate all coures with truffle added..

PRO:
- service is very good
- course are cared and very well presented.
- wine list is remarkable
- sommelier, even if very young, is a clever and smart lady.
- at the end the chef did appear to thank hosts: a gentle touch.
-truffle is very good.
nice interiors.
- to be a 3stars, price is interesting (we spent a similar price at 1 starred in Milan... (see review..)

CONS:
- fixed menu: in a 3 stars we can expect the cook for us following our desires,  a bit rough we had to eat their proposal without knowing them in advance.
- place is a bit hidden: address is ""piazza duomo"" but we and other hosts failed to find it: is in a small street near.
- usual un-polite strangers: the chat aloud, and maitre did not say a word.. :(
- we honestly expected more from a 3 *.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/21/c8/49/41/2-course.jpg

Food: 4","Delicious but not particularly memorable","Piazza Duomo marked the end of two solid days of eating white truffles throughout the area - this is our fourth trip to Alba. We were at Piazza Duomo with a friend and of course we ordered the truffle menu. The first thing we were astonished by was to learn that the 270 euro price did not include the price of any truffles, which were charged by each gram we used. The price of the truffles was 13 euros a gram, more than 2x the street price (the price charged at well-reputed trattorias), which seemed egregious. Our Italian friend who eats in Alba every year was shocked by this system. 

Needless to say, their ""generosity"" shaving truffles on our dishes seemed more extractive than generous (whereas we left a meal the previous night with the exact opposite impression of a restaurant that included the truffle cost in the price of the menu)

Most of the dishes were very good, and the chef's reputation is well deserved. There was only one dish that missed the mark. Like so many other chefs, this chef also tried to pair truffles with chicken, perhaps to marry the simple with the sublime? Either way, it rarely works, and his dish didn't either. He actually had a delicious marsala sauce on it that married well with the flavor of the truffles. We all scraped the sauce off the chicken and ate that with the truffles. We ate the chicken separately.

The chef is reputed to be known in Italy for his experience in Japan, and he is known to marry the east with the west in his cooking. As a Japanese national who is intimately familiar with Japanese cuisine, I must say that I saw little trace of that influence. His weakness in fact appears to be vegetables, even though that is a big element in Japanese cuisine (to be fair we did not have the salad he's supposedly famous for). There was one savory custard dish that was stunning that could possibly have  been influenced by the Japanese chawanmushi though it also could have been a variation of the sformato. 

The biggest issue here is the service. We found the wait staff to be pushy, impersonal and lacking in knowledge. The descriptions of the dishes were perfunctory at best, a recitation of the ingredients. Chefs that produce dishes of this caliber usually like to share the story about the source of the ingredients or the intentions behind the dish, but the descriptions were little more than a recitation of the ingredients. We also would've expected the servers to be a little more excited and engaged in the dishes, but you almost got a sense of boredom from them. Incidentally, when my husband went to the restroom, he saw three of the servers chatting amongst themselves with no attention on the guests. 

At the end of the dinner, the server presented us with a menu for eight different coffees. When we asked for the difference between them, they were unable to tell us more than how one had the flavor of chocolate or another had a little more acidity than the others. Or that all of them were 100% arabica beans. If you are charging 15 euros for high-end espresso, they should have a little more information than that. 

If you come here, you will for sure have a wonderful meal, but for us once was enough.","8","","NONE","2021-11-30","2021-11-18","2021-11-18","en","Piazza Duomo","1492721","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194664-d1492721-r819207124-Piazza_Duomo-Alba_Province_of_Cuneo_Piedmont.html"

This experience was simply amazing and from start to finish we were in complete awe of the service and food.  We made reservation well in advance and were greeted by a great team of people.  From that point on we were just blown away.  The wine list was extensive, easy to navigate and well laid out.  As far as the food goes there just aren't enough adjectives to describe it.  We ordered the Insalata 21, 31,41, 51...., the herb encrusted lamb loin and a pasta dish with chunks of fresh seafood but so much more came out!  Beef tartare  that was disguised as olives, an array of little dishes with little treats and so much more!!!
