Atmosphere: 4","Wonderful place; Prices out of Control","I'll keep this simple; I love this place, but a) it's really not up to the standard of most three star Michelin restaurants, and b) the prices are out of control. To charge $388 with tax and tip extra, and still have up-charges for many items that they used to not up-charge for (I'm looking at you, Tin of Sin and Cheese Cart) is just ridiculous. Again, I've eaten here many times, and I've enjoyed every meal, but they need better service, more courses, and more unique foods/presentations to come close to justify their prices now.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r978704238-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Disappointing","Unfortunately the Inn at Little Washington's model of a multi-course meal of rich food is fundamentally flawed. While some of the dishes on the Gastronaut menu were delicious, it would have benefitted from dropping at least two of the courses, which would have made the meal more enjoyable. Sadly, the Gastronaut's menu was extremely disappointing with 3 of the dishes too salty, so much so that one of them was inedible. Since we were driving home afterwards, we tried the non-alcoholic wine but all three proved undrinkable. Overall, not the evening we had hoped for and definitely not worth the money. Too bad because the service was impeccable and all the staff delightful.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-24","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r976502176-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

I should have known something was amiss the moment I saw a baseball hat embroidered with three stars for sale in the gift shop. 

Unsure how this restaurant is considered by the Michelin organization to equal the breathtaking Core in London, standard-setting and historic Paul Bocuse in Lyon, stunning Le Bernardin in NYC etc. etc. 

Our dining experience echoed that of other less-than reviews listed on this platform. We considered our time at The Inn at Little Washington a waste of preparation, anticipation and money. We’ve had far better for far less.

Nothing new to say, I'm sure, but rather just to confirm what has already been said about this iconic restaurant. The food was outstanding and the service unparalleled. The attention to detail was off the charts. Tip 1:: eat in the kitchen if you can, the entire experience is a creative masterpiece. Tip 2: Arrive around 30 minutes before your reservation time to experience the bar and explore the restaurant a bit. Interesting fun fact: I wasn't able to make out what the kitchen staff on the other side of the kitchen were shouting periodically. (The kitchen is big!) I was curious and followed up with an online inquiry the next day (having forgotten to ask our wonderful waiter), and received a prompt response: ""the kitchen sounds out 'here we are' to acknowledge that a guest is arriving or departing the kitchen."" It reminded me of the traditional Japanese greeting in restaurants, also delivered at a high volume: ""irasshaimase!!""","0","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-09-29","2024-09-29","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r971821545-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

Atmosphere: 3","Not worth it","I initially hesitated to write this review, but I realized that every restaurant, regardless of its reputation, deserves honest feedback. My wife and I dined here for our anniversary, hoping for a memorable experience. Unfortunately, while the food was good, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. My wife’s entrée, a prosciutto-wrapped tenderloin, arrived lukewarm at best, which was disappointing.

However, the main reason for this review is the unsettling feeling we left with. The waitstaff’s demeanor made us feel as though we were a burden or had unknowingly offended them. We spent part of the evening and even the next day questioning if we had done something wrong. The only explanation we could think of was that we were among the last seatings of the night, and perhaps the staff had already mentally checked out.

When I spend nearly $1300 on a dinner, I shouldn't be left wondering if it was my fault that the service was subpar. In contrast, the previous night we dined at Three Blacksmiths and left with a sense of joy, eager to recommend it to friends and family. It was less than half the price, yet the service was far superior, and the food quality was on par. I’ve had better service at places like DC Prime or Morton’s.

Maybe I don’t fully understand what a 3-star Michelin rating signifies, but based on this experience, it didn’t seem to offer anything extraordinary. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant, as it did not feel worth the money.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-02","2024-09-02","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r968047689-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

Everything was absolutely perfect from start to finish. Arriving at the Inn, you are greeted with respect as you are whisked from your car into the Inn. Our server was excellent and had quite the sense of humor! He provided detailed explanations of the dishes as well as tidbits about the restaurant, chef, etc. We felt the wine pairing was true perfection. Each dish complimented each glass and vice versa. With every bite, we were transported to a place of pure enjoyment. Not only that, but each dish was a work of art in the craftsmanship it took to create the display. After dinner, we relaxed for some time in the lounge and were treated to a tour of the kitchen where we had the honor of meeting Chef O'Connell. After dinner, our car was outside with the AC on and engine running, just waiting for us to settle in. Every moment was perfect and we could not have asked for anything more.

Atmosphere: 4","Good, but not 3 Michelin star good.","Having eaten at other 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants, I’m not quite sure how the Inn has 3.

The food is good, but there were not multiple life changing dishes that we wanted to eat more of.  Maybe 1 or 2. Compared to Le Bernadin or L’Enclume, where we noted we’d come back for a big plate of nearly everything we ate, the Inn’s executions were enjoyable, but not particularly unique or memorable, with the exception of the lobster chartreuse.

The cheese course was excellent, but felt a bit rushed in its presentation, and was somewhat delayed in arrival. The cheese  server’s funny asides and puns were cute and clever, but they took away from time that could have been better spent seriously describing the cheeses. I suppose the jovial presentation is geared toward people who perhaps don’t really care to hear much about the varieties.

One cheese course detail I took great exception to was being served Carr’s Table Crackers with the cheese (along with some nice bread we’d already had during the meal). I mean, really? Carr’s? The same crackers I can buy at any grocery store? Served at a 3 star Michelin restaurant?  Embarrassing at best. Insulting at worst.

The bar experience both before and after dinner was a little odd.

We initially went to Patty O’s bar for a glass of pre-dinner champagne. While we were warmly greeted there, that was the beginning and end of the attention. The sole bartender didn’t look at or address us in any way. Meanwhile a gaggle of staff chatted away at the host’s station. After a few minutes of this inattention, we left for the Monkey Bar at the Inn across the street.

The Monkey Bar isn’t a proper bar with stools or chairs. It’s table service only, so any opportunity to chat with a bartender or a neighbor is mostly gone.

We were shown the ”bar”, but given no guidance as to where to sit. Oddly, we were asked if we were joining them for tea. They already knew we were there for dinner. Do a lot of dinner guests arrive early for tea? This spoke to a lack of communication.

We plopped down in 2 chairs l hoped weren’t reserved, and waited several minutes for any kind of recognition. Finally, someone came by to wipe down our table, which in my mind should have been done immediately after the previous guest left, not as we sat there watching.

A server came by to take a water order and chatted with us briefly about the whisky offerings. But after he left, he was replaced by s different server and we never interacted with him again.

This proved to be somewhat thematic throughout dinner. We were told we had one main server, and we did see her a few times, but it felt like each course was served by someone different, with varying levels of knowledge, polish, and enthusiasm.

One server kicked our table. Another bumped abruptly into my wife’s arm with no apology. So much for those ballet lessons Patrick paid for for the staff!

We asked for sparkling water. A random server brought it. I didn’t recognize the label so I enthusiastically asked “Oh, what’s that?”, pointing to the label. “Sparkling water” replied the server. lol come on. She eventually grasped that I was asking where it was from.

After the meal, we sensed they wanted the table back, so we decided to get after dinner drinks back at the bar.

Again, no actual bar, just some cushy chairs. It was comfortable, but my wife was a bit chilly from the AC blowing on her legs.

I asked our bar server if they had a throw she could use. He replied “Of course”, which has maddeningly become the de facto reply from the younger generation of servers today, to every request, regardless of the sincerity of the responder or the response.

No throw ever materialized. My wife remained chilly.

More chilly than the air however, were the drink prices.  $200 for a 1 ounce pour of an unusual but certainly not rare Islay Scotch, an entire bottle of which can be purchased for $250. $51 for a 1 ounce pour of basic Laphroaig 10 year. A bottle of that is $60 most places. Champagne by the glass prices were similarly silly. 

I guess the alcohol prices were designed to keep people from lingering after the meal, and to make the $170 wine pairing seem like a bargain. 

The wine pairing was fantastic I should add. And our sommelier, Nicole, was easily the most attentive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic server we encountered the entire evening. The perfect mix of personable and professional.

Had more of the staff been as great at what they do as Nicole is, I could see 3 Michelin stars. As it is, much of the staff seemed like college kids on summer break.

There is much talk of Mr. O’Connell expanding the Inn. Until he can shore up the service (and push the food envelope a bit) as it stands, I think he risks losing a star or two by becoming even larger. It’s clearly already a challenge for Mr. O’Connell to find experienced knowledgeable staff in the middle of the Virginia countryside. I don’t see how expanding his operation begets better service.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-27","2024-05-27","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r952664580-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

Atmosphere: 1","I hated every minute of it. Michelin should be clawing their stars back.","What was supposed to be a fantastic evening, turned into a nightmare. 

It started a few hours before our dinner when they called and asked me if I would move our reservation up an hour because they had some last-minute cancellations. I figured maybe they had some VIPs or something and wanted my slot. I didn’t really care so I agreed, but clearly explained that I wanted to have a drink before dinner in their bar area. She understood and agreed, saying that a lot of guests do that.

So I thought all was good. It wasn't.

I show up on time and am greeted with “your table is ready.” I asked to have ten minutes for a drink at the bar, but the receptionist wasn't having it. after explaining that we had discussed it when they asked to move my reservation up, she agreed but gave me a disgusted and snarky “fine, let us know when you are ready” sendoff.  

So, I am left in a horrible confrontation situation which I didn’t ask for. But, now it is awkward, people think I’m being difficult, they are mad, etc. In any other situation I would have asked my wife if it was ok to leave and find another spot  – but they make you pre-pay a small fortune, it’s our anniversary, there is nowhere else to go in the town, and we drove hours to get there – so I was stuck, there was nothing I could do. 

I’m so disappointed because all I wanted was a few minutes to enjoy a high-end, caringly made Manhattan before dinner. I'm sure it sounds small, but I was truly looking forward to it because I only drink on special occasions due to a health scare. Unfortunately for me, that moment was ruined. There was no way I could enjoy myself so I gave up, and couldn't get out of the bar to our table fast enough. But the whole negative vibe carried over into dinner – where I felt rushed and unsettled. My wife knew I was upset and did her best. But, the entire dinner, meal, experience sucked. I hated every minute of it. 

I’m sure everyone else will rave about the place. And I get it, having been there half-dozen times for dinners, fundraisers, special occasions - so I do appreciate it. But, that is gone. 

No way should this have happened – especially at a place where it costs $1,200 for dinner for two. 

As far as the food went, it could have been the best meal in the world and it wouldn’t have mattered to me under the circumstances. But, it wasn’t even particularly good. They killed the shrimp and duck with dill. Except for some egg thing (which was great) the rest was just ok. 

While I’m at it, one thing that surprised me was that the mens room was a bit gross. I expect that at an airport or some public place. But, not at a restaurant like this. In all fairness, it’s not entirely their fault if someone can’t hit the urinal, and I noticed someone was heading that way to clean things up. But, it’s a bad look for sure.","4","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-19","2024-05-19","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r951439652-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

What stood out to me was how pampered I felt. There were more staff taking care of us than there were customers. The lodging was super cute and had everything one could wish for, and with small, nice gifts in several rounds. Of course, it wasn't cheap. 

The dinner was exquisite but with a few things that could have been better. I loved everything I ate, and the dishes were nicely (and sometimes innovatively) presented. But, while the menu left my wife full, I finished the meal feeling I had room for more. And I am not super huge or anything. We seem to have been unlucky with the bread service. We didn't get any bread (other tables did) and when I asked if we could also get some bread, the response was ""Yes, I can get you some bread"", as if I were asking for a side order, rather than a response like ""Oh, sorry, we missed you, we will get you bread right away"". And I had to do it again for a second piece of bread. This is  very unusual for any good restaurant. Perhaps I was unlucky.

I was also a little disappointed with the breakfast. We got a very nice parfait of sort and then a basket with different types of mostly sweet stuff. Anything else, like an omelet or such would cost an extra $25--rather outrageous in my view. I had expected a nice buffet with lots of different types of bread, cheeses, yogurts, etc., as I would get in any hight star hotel.

All in all, we had a great stay here and enjoyed the pampering and the excellent food, but I few things did not live up to my expectations (for the price we paid)","1","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-09","2024-02-09","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r937588024-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

I was even given a tour of the kitchens.","0","","SOLO","2023-07-31","2024-02-06","2024-02-06","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r937066939-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

Atmosphere: 5","The Ultimate Experience for a Foodie","I do not understand the negative reviews.  If you are complaining about the cost, then this is not a culinary experience for you.  If you are complaining about the portions, then I do not know what to say, but I was more than full and I did not consume everything they offered to me. 

My boyfriend and I booked the kitchen table for a birthday celebration.   We were immediately greeted and ushered to the living room of the Inn where we enjoyed some cocktails before dinner.  Then we were greeted by one of the hosts and ushered into the kitchen itself for dinner after being told that we had our table for the entire evening and should not feel rushed, but encourage to tarry and enjoy.  

When we entered the kitchen there was an enjoyable exhibition of pomp and circumstance as we were personally greeted by Chef Patrick O'Connell by name and his brilliant smile.  Our table was spacious and the seating comfortable.  Immediately the attentive staff began to serve and accommodate us.  Everyone was gracious and enjoyable.  We had water immediately and personalized menus in hand as we were guided through the selections and choices before us.  With those made, we began an incredible experience for any passionate foodie.  

Everything from the house made bread and butter to the parmesan truffle popcorn was not only delicious, but available for unlimited refills.  Restraint was necessary to avoid being overly full long before the end of the meal.  We chose to get everything on the gastronaut's menu between the two of us, including the $62.00 upcharge for the caviar dish.  We had ten courses, including a hand delivered first dessert course by Patrick in honor of the birthday.  Every course and thus every dish was exceptional in taste and presentation.  They then sent us home with a bespoke box of confections.  We got more than I expected.  

We also chose to do the wine pairing, and with that additional charge, I can say that one should expect to spend several thousand dollars for an all in dining experience in the chef's kitchen.  What you pay for is an experience and an encounter with not just the 3 Star Michelin Chef himself, but his staff and to witness first hand the amazing fluidity of the kitchen staff.  While I have never eaten in the dining room, I can say that I would without hesitation come back and dine there.  This was a once in a lifetime experience to mark a special occasion for us, so the expense was well worth it to us,  but if you are concerned about the fiscal bottom line or portion size, then this might now be the culinary experience for you.  For us, it was one to remember forever.

The only issue we had was that during our arrival the person at the front desk ask for prove of the reservation. I did not have cell signal and could not show her. She made me and my wife very uncomfortable. I would expect that an hotel that is so highly regarded would have better service at their reception. After I gave her my Id and told her to check she found my reservation. She should have asked for an ID before she asked for proof of reservation. If you are white they probably won't have any issues finding your reservation.

Overall, after this small incident, everything was perfect and the stay was memorable. Breakfast at the hotel was also excellent and service during breakfast was great.

I really wanted to walk into this experience loving it but it was average, over priced, and underwhelming (just like I stated in my title). 

Staff: Very friendly and super nice, they greeted us at the door and walked us to our table (as expected).  The service at the table was a miss for me, they left crumbs on our table from the bread and it was never cleaned up, usually you’ll have people who come around and clean your crumbs. There wasn’t a stool or a basket where you can put your purse or belongings in, usually they have that at the the table. The sommelier wasn’t certified but he was the sweetest kid! I could tell he was still in training due to his lack of knowledge of pairing the wine with the food, and I also learned that he tried deconstructed dishes that are usually left overs to help him pair the wine which I find very interesting because if you want consistency  throughout the experience, every sommelier should be treated the same. I understand that he’s in training but why wouldn’t you have a certified sommelier around to assist him. The condensation from the wine dripped over my fiancé bread as it was being poured, I’m used a clean bottle. Overall the staff was nice and knowledgeable. 

Food: The food was so good but it wasn’t great. We picked the Gastronomy menu with the wine pairing. I found it odd that with the menu you still had to pick this or that, I’m used to enjoying everything on the menu as is but if we still need to pick between appetizers, main course, and dessert let’s not call it a tasting menu. The food was cooked and well prepared but the plating was boring and subpar, there was no theme to the menu it was just food on a white plate.  None of the dishes wowed me it was just good. The wine paired well with the food but we didn’t get the background of what notes to taste for or look forward to, I didn’t enjoy the 4 empty glasses placed on the table for future wine to come, it over crowded our table and it made it a little complicating for our server to serve us food as things had to be moved around — not the type of service you would expect from a 3-star. 

Parking: Plenty of parking and valet available.
Ambiance: Beautiful seating area and nice colonial feel. 
Vegetarian and’s vegan options available.

Overall Summary: In short, you don’t get what you pay for. I suggest you save up the $2K you’re about to spend on this experience and purchase a plane ticket overseas and pay for a 3-star in Spain or France.","7","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-13","2023-08-13","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910037648-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"

How is this rated your highest grade?","This restaurant is good but overhyped. I think Michelin gives this one a “pass” due to the uniqueness of its location, the history and frankly it needs to be re-rated because it does not meet the standard of a Michelin 3 star like Aponiente in Spain. I had high expectations due to how everyone in the town speaks so highly of this place. It honestly feels a little weird because it’s as if everyone is afraid to speak truthfully on the restaurant out of fear they’ll disappear like in a horror movie, kind of cultish vibes. If this is your first Michelin I get why you’d love this place but they have some work to do. 

Anyway, out of all of the Michelin restaurants I’ve been to, the service, the presentation and the food all was top notch and was like a dance. The Inn at Little Washington seemed like they were resting on the fact that they were a top rated restaurant and didn’t need to work as hard. For a restaurant that I spent nearly $1,600 for I expected a lot. 

I didn’t like that I had to pick between menus. Since I paid for a tasting menu with a wine pairing I expected the restaurant to provide several courses that would fill me up and I was not anywhere near full at the conclusion of dinner. The plating and presentation of the food was boring, there was no style or awe factor in how the food was presented. Most places will try to match the cuisine to a creative plate. It was pretty underwhelming. The Michelin company rated The Inn to have a gastronomy star yet the restaurant didn’t explain what specifically about their menu was gastronomy like others that I’ve been too. 

The sommelier we had wasn’t certified and didn’t have his grape pin. Typically Michelin restaurants who have a sommelier in training will have an actual sommelier with them throughout the dining experience. With our wine pairing they placed several empty glasses on the table which I had never seen before and didn’t fill them, typically your wine glasses aren’t just sitting on the table taking up space from your plates. Generally each glass is brought to you for each course. They didn’t take the time to wipe off the bottles after they pulled it from the wine cooler, as the sommelier in training poured, there was lots of ice water from the bottle dripping on our table and food. 

The waiters didn’t remove bread crumbs from our table, didn’t fold our napkins when we went to the restroom, didn’t have a stool or basket for us to put our belongings in at our table. Nothing during the fine dining screamed three star restaurant, I think Michelin needs to re-evaluate this, I believe this place is a ONE star at best. Overseas Michelin’s seem to have to go through a higher grading criteria because I’ve seen way better places that are underrated that could be two or three stars and the Inn is somehow rated higher with not nearly as good of service. 

Typically if the chef is not on travel they will come out and greet their guest and Mr. O’Connell didn’t seem to have the time I presume to stop by tables to simply say hello. I truly expected more but you know what they say about high expectations leading to high disappointment. It’s just not worth the money spent.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/09/4e/df/caption.jpg

Our only expectation was that the experience would justify the $2800 we paid for a party of 4. I feel strongly that objectively it missed the mark.
I will repeat what others reviewers have already stated. My very first cocktail was incorrect. The food service timing was oddly off. A table close to us was seated after we were and was on their 3rd course before our appetizers arrived. The bread service was inconsistent and as many have pointed out the breadcrumbs on our table were only removed prior to our desert. Quarters were cramped, forcing servers to reach over the table. Multiple times during the meal objects were dropped close by startling all of us. Overall the service was good but not delivered with ease and the engagements felt rehearsed. The star of the evening was our sommelier. Her knowledge and explanations of our wine pairings were both insightful and entertaining. At the end of our meal we were not offered after dinner drinks or coffee/tea service. We end up retiring to the bar area for drinks, where the disappointment continued and we waited 15 minutes for someone to recognize we were done so we could pay our check. I ended up paying cash for the drinks so we could leave without any further hurdles.
It’s unfortunate and I don’t think we’ll be back.","4","","FAMILY","2023-08-31","2023-08-13","2023-08-13","en","Inn at Little Washington","497947","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910006803-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html"
