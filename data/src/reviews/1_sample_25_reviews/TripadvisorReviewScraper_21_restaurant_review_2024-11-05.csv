The flavor was addicting! Service  was excellent and they explained each course. They are proud of their restaurant and should be.

On the main street - in a likewise charming and beautifully renovated house - you'll find Hisa Linhardt. It is primarily a gorgeous restaurant with an ""attached"" hotel.

The old and renovated - simple yet elegant - house (and yes, hisa means house) have some hotel room individually decorated and of different sizes.
After the dinner it is rather nice to take ten steps to your bed, so consider an overnight stay.

Ten steps... indeed. There are a number of rooms for dining spread out all over the house. So, for instance, our party of four were seated on the landing of the first floor. Even after quite a dose of champagne it will be hard not to find the way home...

Ambition in the kitchen is high and so is the skill. Clever flavour compositions with both traditional cooking and surprises charactherizes the menu.
Wich can be had as 5, 7 or 9 courses.
For what Hisa Linhardt can deliver, the prizes are moderate and affordable for an experience of this kind.
Present prizes (August -23) are 89, 109 and 129 EUR respectively.

We had the 5 course and with one amuse bouche coming in after another we ended up with around 10 servings.

We took the wine pairing to see what the sommelier felt was right to the different courses. He was mostly spot on - with some few drawbacks. On the other hand much is of course about personal taste.

Amongst all that was being served we felt that the vegetable dishes really shined. Also when shellfish was presented, we admired the knowledge in the kitchen how to treat really fine ingredients without drowning them in other flavours.

On the whole a wonderful evening and the Michelin star is definitely well deserved!

Highly recommended!

I organised a birthday dinner for 10 people plus a small child and everything, from the planning stage to the actual dining experience can only be defined as exquisite! The restaurant is in a beautifully restored building; we were given a private dining room for our party. The service staff was both highly professional and kind and catered perfectly to various dietary needs. 

The dishes were all, without exception, delicious and beautifully presented. The vegan menu is as carefully and lovingly crafted as the ""regular"" menu, and I highly recommend it. All ingredients are locally and sustainably sourced. We chose local wines and were not disappointed. 

As a Michelin star restaurant, Linhart is the right place to celebrate special occasions. I would like to extend a special word of thanks to Marcela, who helped me in the planning stage and welcomed us with her warmth, and to Chef Uroš, whose delicious creations will never be forgotten. 

Thank you, we will definitely be back!

A beautiful spacious room with two bathrooms available.
A very welcoming breakfast room.
We were unable to taste the gastronomic offer of this renowned and starred hotel as it was closed, a real shame.
Great quality breakfast.
A highly recommended place.
Thank you ....","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/90/18/9e/caption.jpg

Hîsa Linhart can offer you all this and more. Rightly awarded the Michelin star (one of nine in the whole of Slovenia to have received the precious recognition) but also the green star of sustainability, it is the restaurant of the inn of the same name housed in an ancient building in the town of Radovljica, a stone's throw from the celebrated lake Bled. Landscapes with the unmistakable connotation typical of Alpine valleys, where woods and pastures are surrounded by mountains often covered in snow. We are just over 600 meters above sea level but thanks to the scent and clarity of the air it seems like we are decidedly higher.
Hîsa Linhart's cuisine rightly finds its products precisely in these areas and from organic and highly sustainable farms and crops and find their sublimation here.
The menus offered include 5, 7 or 9 courses.
It's true...it's New Year's Eve but the choice of seven courses will prove to be the right choice, the right compromise between hunger and gluttony. Mountain cuisine, certain cuisine, is particularly captivating also because it uses materials that can only be found in these places, materials that have the scent and flavor of natural, healthy, intact things. And the dishes, all the dishes on our menu will not betray this promise.
The service is enhanced by the affability and professionalism of the kind owner of the restaurant who always presented the dishes to us in perfect Italian with precision and friendliness.
A stop that allowed us to spend New Year's Eve in a new and unexpected way, in a different and original dimension, in tranquility savoring the proposals of excellent cuisine, far from the balls with unthinkable menus and crazy prices
Thank you Hîsa Linhart, we really had a great time!
Too bad the rain then ruined the street party...","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/33/9d/a4/caption.jpg
