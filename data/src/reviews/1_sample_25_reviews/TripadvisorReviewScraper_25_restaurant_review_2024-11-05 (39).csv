It's all just too much so there's not 1 dish that stood out, not 1 experience that we can remember. 
What we will remember is the hostess in a way too tight outfit who we haven't seen smiling one time. The staff kept walking around, we liked the seating which is informal and facing the center of the courtyard (we sat next to each other which was very cozy and pleasant) , service was great, but cutlery was not always clean. 
An experience definitely and we wouldn't want to have missed it (not even for 250 euro pp without drinks) but there's no 1 dish we will remember and we probably won't go back...  
oh and parking an electric car in the vicinity... the car park with 400 lotz in total has only 2 for electric cars...","0","","NONE","2022-07-31","2022-07-30","2022-07-29","en","De Librije","748025","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r850739637-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html"

This is probably the worlds most accessible three star Michelin restaurant. Very casual, very down to earth accessible with mind-blowing dishes with lots of thought, techniques and presentation both very old school and quite new school. Skill is not used for the sake of skill but to deliver the sensation, the experience and the emotion. Most memorable are the ‘ Broodje Paling’ and the ‘ Hunnebedden’. About the former: Based on local cuisine, the chefs personal taste, old technique, some table-side cooking and a very original cocktail this is a unique amalgation of both haute cuisine , Dutch Cucina Povere and originality. A very thought provoking take on eal sandwich. For me, this is Dutch culture at it’s best: Bravo!
Concerning ‘ Hunnebedden’: The young chef responsible for this dish deserves praise; this dish is a reimagination of ‘Desert’. Describing it does not do any justice to the experience. Surprise, wonder, reward comes to mind.
Highly recommended.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/14/fe/c3/photo1jpg.jpg

We especially enjoyed the fish dishes and the duck, but the best dish for me was the steak tartare from watermelon, mindblowing how much flavour watermelon can have. 

The reason we only give a 3 star rating is that the service was sometimes poor service. A few things happened that did not match our expectations of a three star restaurant and the price level. First, our water was not refilled automatically and after we notified the staff that we would like a refill of our water, we saw a waiter walking around with water and refilling the water at all tables except for our table. When our next course was served the staff saw that we still hadn’t got any water and then waiter came up to our table and said that there was a miscommunication and he asked if we want sparkling or still water. They should have asked directly and not waiting so long. Secondly, my girlfriends wine was served promptly, while I had to wait a while for my beer that matched the dish to be served. Finally, there was a mix up in the tea and coffee order. I got my girlfriends order and she got mine. Again, this wouldnt have bothered us at a “regular” restaurant, but it matters at this price point.

Positive regarding the service; Sommelier served me my  favoriete beer that matched our desert and did not put on the bill. We had discussed craft beers during the evening and he had figured out that I would really like the Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait.

Food: 4","A very special experience, but......","It was an old wish to have dinner once at the Librije. We did recently. We had the ten course menu, which was completed with some five amuses. Some of the dishes were delicious, many were 'interesting'. They were composed of many ingredients and beautifully made up. It was made and served with much care by the big (and friendly) staff. But. It is all a question of taste, but I did not like the concept. You can hardly and mostly not recignize the food you are eating. All the courses were very tiny, in fact you get 15 amuses. Besides, you get the food on black or dark plates, and I prefer white ones. So it is very special, interesting, very good. It is an experience indeed, but it is not my piece of cake (which they do not serve, by the way)","3","","NONE","2019-11-30","2019-11-10","2019-11-10","en","De Librije","748025","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r725387967-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html"

Food: 5","Memorable experience, natural feeling","We visited the Librije on a saturday evening. We decided to go for the  8 course menu, as 10 seemed a bit too much. We asked for pairing wines, with a focus on red wines (generally you end to get more whites than reds otherwise) .
During the menu we decided to extend with the cheese trolley.

The experience was nearly perfect (we only had to ask once for a refill of our water glasses) without getting pretentious.   The focus is clearly on excellent food, much less on posh appearance.  

We started off with a few amuses and then Jonny Boer came with the first course (as it is made from eel and other fish from his birth ground).
Then we got (a.o.) a crab salad, ceviche from lobster, a curry like dish, the famous librije egg with caviar, main was the dry aged duck and desert was fermented pineapple. 

All dishes are served with a small card, describing the dish, to take home.

Interestingly we drank  a variety of reds (and a champagne from Eric Rodez) with the dishes, that still were dominant (shell) fish (sometimes paired with duck liver). But they were were a good fit, a Regent from NL (""Kiss of Therese""), South African wine made from portugese grapes (Sijnn), a Montalcino wine (Troncone), Australian Cabernet Malbec Blend. Recioto Valpollicella .  During the meal we got a tour through the kitchen and later also through the cellars.   The meal ended with coffee and friandises.","3","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-10-29","2019-10-29","en","De Librije","748025","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r722244590-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html"

The desserts were nowhere near as good but still interesting and fine! Too bad the restaurant is over one hour drive from Amsterdam..

Upon arriving our party was led to a lounge where aperetifs and amuses were served. The champagne was alright, non-alcoholic variant was forgettable. Amuses featured very basic ingredients but flavour was great. 

The dining room itself is located in a skylit courtyard. The food itself is incredible, mostly humble ingredients with complex preparations from all over the world and balanced flavours. Some dishes were bold while others more subtle but all of them were refined.

Staff was casual, friendly and they didn't charge for extra coffee and wine which was a nice gesture you don't always find in this level of restaurant.

All in all a very pleasurable experience but don't expect them to lay down the red carpet for you, this really is all about the food.","3","","NONE","2019-08-31","2019-09-02","2019-09-02","en","De Librije","748025","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r705642411-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html"

We stayed in Amsterdam and caught the train to Zwolle and back. The train is a frequent service and runs very late.
The restaurant is a 15 minute walk from the station. No taxis in Zwolle was our experience so plan time for the walk.
Zwolle is delightful.
De Librije building is fabulous and I loved the art they had crammed inside.
Lounge and restaurant spaces very different but decor fabulous. Table spacing in restaurant very generous so other diners not intruding upon our space or conversation. 
Service. Almost perfect. Had to ask for water but only because glasses are badly designed and staff cannot see when they are empty. A very professional team and goodness they work hard.
Food. We chose the seven menu. There are a large variety of options for your degustation which made me nervous on their part as I wasn’t sure why they wanted to tempt fate by introducing the complexity of so many options. The execution was almost perfect. Just two waits that seemed oddly lengthy when it looked to me that they were synchronising diners. Overall the experience from in to out took four hours which felt 30/45 minutes too long.
Food. Presentation flawless. Variety of flavours and textures excellent.
Food. Seven was though courses for us. We counted 15 dishes including all the amuse bouche and others. It felt generous.
Wine. We chose the cheapest bottle in the menu which was recommended on the first page of the list. I was very impressed that the menu would recommend a 45 euro bottle. And of course it was very satisfactory.
Theatre. Yes there is some accompanying theatre, colour and movement. We were very impressed both jonnie and therese spoke to us ( and everyone ) as part of the experience. We loved the kitchen tour. 
Go to dish? For me it was langoustine so moist and flavoursome. Eggs, trout, duck and citrus all memorable dishes also. 

Value. We paid AUD 880 (for two seven courses with one bottle of wine) excluding train to Zwolle which was AUD 130 return for two. Conversion rate of Aussie to Euro is 1.64 today. It’s expensive. Nevertheless I thought the experience was fabulous. We are both very pleased we went. We recommend the experience to anyone contemplating booking.

Food: 5","Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride.","Three Michelin stars, a reputation of the best restaurant in the Benelux ánd a former designation on the list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. We had been very curious for prestigious restaurant De Librije in Zwolle, The Netherlands, for a long time and now we were given the opportunity to visit De Librije with our team. Our expectations were high.
 
We arrived at the impressive property, which used to be a prison from the 18th century. Five members of the staff were waiting for our arrival and welcomed us in an attentive and formal way. We immediately felt very welcome. While our coats were carried away by one of them, another one took us through the narrow corridors right to the lounge area. Well, this space did not always function as the ‘lounge area’ it is today: it used to be a prisoners cell. It felt strange and exciting at the same time to be aware of the fact that prisoners – men, women, children – served their sentences right at this place where at this moment a festive glass of bubbly Champagne was poured to us before our extensive royal meal would be served. Kind of sinister, but interesting and enthralling at the same time.
 
In this mysterious room surrounded by lots of natural elements, we were pleased to be welcomed by co-owner and renowned sommelier Thérèse de Boer. Her formal yet cordial hospitality and genuine interest secured us of the feeling we were in for a perfectly organized experience at her restaurant. Just in case we were not looking forward to our dinner already, several bites made sure to make us salivate for more, under which there was a crisp of Mangalitza bacon and a duo of celery and gherkin with mayonaise and piccalilli. The taste of each bite was delicate and refined and the presentation of the bites was purely outstanding. You could notice lots of attention had been given to the presentation and use of colors.
 
Our experience continued by Thérèse leading us the way to the restaurant area. A playful, open and light space full of round tables with rough, leather tablecloths on them. The place where the prisoners could receive their daylight was turned into a unique gastronomic ambiance. A nice thing about this space is that during lunch, you can enjoy the daylight because of the glass ceiling. Big plus is that you can really admire all photogenic dishes with optimal lighting this way!
 
At lunch, the same dishes are served as during dinner. During our visit, the impressive sounding 10-course ‘Librije menu’ was served to us, accompanied by 6 pairing premium wines selected by wine expert Thérèse de Boer herself.
 
Concerning the food and wines: in this article we will not explicitly point out that each dish and each glass of wine was so well balanced and tasteful. They all were, trust us. And even though the one dish could be considered more complex than the other, all courses – from the bread with butter on the table to the friandises – were of high quality in terms of the taste of ingredients, the presentation and originality.
 
All 10 courses of the menu had its own classical touch.
 
At first, chef Jonnie de Boer introduced himself to our table. While doing so, he presented several exciting amuses together with a little card from his small and typically Dutch hometown Giethoorn. Something personal, we like that! The presentation of the amuses made it worth admiring them all for a while before we had the pleasure to finally taste them. The soft tasting amuses truly did what they had to do: making us curious for more to come.
 
Oyster, goat cheese and seaweed is what came to us then. An unusual combination of unique flavors put together in a superb way. For the ones with a goat cheese allergy among our team, a plate of vegetarian steak tartare of dried water melon with piccalilli was served. Besides the subtle yet full and fruity taste, the contrast created by the combination of the spicy redness of the tartare and the grey plate made it a dish to remember.
 
De Librije is a restaurant where offal is a frequently used ingredient. Besides a piece of brown crab in juice of toasted celery, chicken liver and heart of veal could be found on the dish served to us as a second course. Classic and intense flavors. A glass of Chenin blanc full of acids and oak flavors was served with this course, which managed to create a rich, round taste in combination with the food.
 
The same wine turned out the be a great match with the third course as well: a tender piece of langoustine, prepared as ceviche in a fermented Japanese tea, combined with tomatoes, kombucha and snake beans. The sour tea found its balance through the high level of acids in the wine.
 
The fourth course – yes, we’re not even halfway yet – consisted of saibling, pumpkin, lovage and a juice of sherry and almonds. Now, how can it be possible that we have always eaten saibling without any juice of sherry and almonds?! The taste combination was exactly how it should be. An excellent wine, a Mâcon-Charnay of 100% chardonnay from 2017 from Winehouse Jean Maciat in France, was served in gigantic crystal glasses in order to bring out the specific, nutty character of the wine.
 
Oriental scents were coming out of the open kitchen when the fifth course came out of it. A curry with monkfish, nasturtium, screw tree and pandan rice was shining on our plates. Delicious.
 
‘Egg caviar’ was the name of our sixth course. This course is considered a real classic of De Librije. Lukewarm egg yolk with cream and a dash of 10 grams of the finest caviar on top of it – what is there not to love here?
 
Another classic on the menu formed the seventh course. First, Thérèse poured us a glass of Pombal do Vesuvio Douro from 2015, originating from the North of Portugal, which had been matured in wood for over 14 months. The wine went great with the natural and earthy tones coming out of the food: veal sweetbread with spicy pineapple and shrimps in peanut sauce. An interesting combination of ingredients that each had an intense taste on its own.
 
This dish illustrates one of the powers of chef Jonnie de Boer and De Librije: the ability to make dining an actual experience through providing surprising and tricky food combinations which can sometimes even be a bit uncomfortable. That’s when it gets fun. The art is to still let such a dish make sense at the same time and we think Jonnie de Boer is a true artist in this respect.
 
The eighth course consisted of ‘Ermelo’s duck’ which had been dried for two days, stuffed with hay and dandelion and then matured in parafine for ten days in order to draw the flavors as much as possible. After this process, the duck had been fried on its carcass and then cut in the form of a T-bone. Next to the duck, our plate was filled with marinated duck skin with meat offal in it, ragout of the stomach of the duck and a juice of fermented celery. Again, in our opinion this was an intense and deeply tasteful dish presented in a unique way.
 
A very interesting Macvin du Jura was brought to us to go with the ninth course: a traditional Macvin of chardonnay (non-fermented grape juice mixed with Marc de Jura) which aged on wood for three years and resulted in a fine dessert drink of 17,5% alcohol and sweet, earthy tones which immediately let us think of the strong, old tasting flavors of rye bread. With this wine, we received a dish of red cheese from the Bourgogne with chorizo, potato juice and tiny rabbit kidneys. Yes, cheese and rabbit kidneys.
 
A lovely intermezzo was created through introducing De Librije’s ice cream car at our table. We got to pick our favorite ice cream. All ice cream was homemade and inspired by summery blossom flowers.
 
Then the grand finale followed: a dessert made up of various citrus fruits, each in a different bowl. The first bowl was about salt. It was filled with orange and salted caramel. The second bowl had a sweet theme and had blood orange as a main ingredient. Sour was the taste of what was inside the third and last bowl: citrus with cucumber.
 
After our dessert, we were invited for a tour in the kitchen. It was impressive to see the hardworking staff fully focussed on preparing only the best for their guests.
 
Our dining experience – and it was an experience indeed – ended with a cup of fine coffee and friandises made by reputable patisserie Bontom, all nicely presented on wooden roots on a trolley.
 
All in all, our heigh expectations have truly been met. Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride. We don’t advise you to go here when you are someone who says ‘I rather don’t eat this or that’ in advance – but in case you are in for some surprises and oddities, De Librije is the food jail get entertained. Trust Jonnie and Thérèse de Boer to take you through the different spaces of the restaurant and be openminded for them sharing all the carefully selected fine food and beautiful wines with you. It’s truly a special experience, without any fuss, ending with a standing ovation.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/d2/a4/27/ohhcuisine.jpg
