Snacks and aperitif is served outside at a very nice terrace. Set menu is enjoyed inside. It has 5 courses, but it's an understatement since there are 16 dishes listed in the menu. 
There is a lobby upstairs you can have coffee and petit fours.
Both food and service were very good. It was quite hot in the dining room but not unbearable. Chef came to discuss with all the guests afterwards. Ambience was relaxed and joyful.
Really nice place, true 3 star!","1","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-17","2024-07-17","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r959943455-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 3","Expected the best, received much less","The welcoming at a beautiful location was amazing. I had a great glass of champagne in a cozy room. The dinner was served in a different room, where a movable heater had to be installed and the cold breeze had to be stopped. While aranging all of this, I had an interesting tour of the wine cellar. All fine...it is a very old building. They serve mainly local and seasonal food, which I very much appriciate. I selected a five course dinner, which started with four different starters, of which all of them were on the very sour side. The individual taste of each ingredients was noticeable on the tongue and palate for a very short time, if at all ...the only thing which lasted was the sour taste....till the next course....same again.. The main courses were ok, but far away from what I would call 3 michelin star quality. On all tables, next to me, people were eating a lot of bread offered aside.... if I write a lot ... real a lot. It seemed to be good, but thoughts are left behind! The service was impeccable. Andreas Caminada seems to be to busy to take care of his core business. Sorry, I am looking forward to eating real great wonders of food.. somewhere else... very high expectations ... but no match.","0","","NONE","2022-12-31","2022-12-15","2022-12-15","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r871823304-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 5","Incredible food but too many things missing","Came for dinner with high expectations as one of our party had been several times before and had fond memories. Incredible amuse-bouches served during the aperitif, each one more fun and enjoyable than the next which set us up for the dinner with great expectations. Then the dinner, great great food and so pretty too. However, wine waiter or sommelier, as was not clear, got the wine wrong twice. Service good but totally mechanical. When the chef came to the table at the end it reflected the service, seemed a chore rather than a pleasure, better not to come at that point. Overall felt more of a factory line which took away from the amazing food. Stayed overnight too and rooms very nice indeed but charging CHF 4 for a small bottle of hand sanitizer seemed bizarre for a CHF 600 / night  room.","0","","NONE","2022-04-30","2022-11-15","2022-11-15","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r868539901-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 5","A unique fantastic experience","After several months from the reservation we finally arrived at Schloss Schauenstein. 
Already the arrival from the parking slot gives a very nice view on the castle.

The multilingual welcome (we talked italian, english and german..) was very nice and the aperitif on the terrace brought the first interesting and tasting surprises. 

We took the full menu (5 course) with accompanying wines (the men) and non alcoholic menu (the ladies). Also an interesting and unique proposal.
The wines proposed were very unique and also an interesting discovery.

The quality, variety, fantasy in each plate was extraordinary from the beginning to the end. The rhytm between each plate perfect as also the service.

Last but not least, toward the end, Andreas Caminada came to our table and we had a nice conversation with some jokes.

An experience to do at least once in a lifetime","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1d/73/0e/ee/main-course.jpg

The great new addition that we enjoyed two days later is the newly opened restaurant Oz next door - also part of the Caminada set-up.. A dozen of vegetables based courses, all dramatically fresh and in a thoughtful Progression in a Counter setting was a great additional experience. Don’t miss it - currently you can get reservations on a couple of weeks notice we were told (rather than months for Schauenstein).","1","","NONE","2021-07-31","2021-07-26","2021-07-25","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r799823351-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

The experience starts with very moody, spot lights-lit tables and just the best restaurant staff I have ever come across. Guests are treated with wonderful attention, just as one would expect in perfection obsessed Switzerland. 
The dishes are an homage to the area but put together with amazing creativity. The sweetbread surprise dish was just perfect. And when the steaming bread arrives with the sea salt butter, it’s culinary heaven. The wine pairings have certainly been given much and thorough thought but cold-served red wine might not be to every wine lover’s taste. But a new option is readily made available following every whim of the guests. 
The meal certainly doesn’t come cheap but combined with the perfect experience provided, it is surely worth every penny and more. ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/00/d9/9a/photo0jpg.jpg

Food: 5","The best restaurant experience in Switzerland","Andreas Caminada is Switzerland's most famous chef, so of course we had heard a lot about his restaurant before we finally made it up to a remote little village in Grison for an extended lunch at Schloss Schauenstein. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We were overwhelmed by the quality and the creativeness of the food, even before we got to the first main course. Caminada starts his menu with plenty of outstanding amuse bouches and appetisers before serving several larger courses. He refrains from using posh ingredients like caviar, wagyu beef or foie gras. Instead, all the dishes are inspired by local produce and recipes. Nevertheless, the combinations of flavours are just heavenly. And on top of it, each plate looks like a wonderful piece of art. The cheese course is another highlight: next to an exclusive selection of Swiss and French cheese, a broad range of side dishes makes for an unmatched variety of exciting flavours to finish off the savoury part of the meal. Of course, there are several sweet courses too. The best of which, in our case, was an extremely fluffy and delicate milk soufflé. The staff is young, and maybe a bit insecure, but this hardly harms the overall experience. At the end of the visit, coffee, digestives and petit fours are served in an upstairs room of the ancient chateau. As the sun sets behind the Grisons mountains, you have all the time in the world to become aware of the breathtaking excellence in cuisine and hospitality you have just enjoyed. This is a restaurant experience second to none in Switzerland!","0","","NONE","2019-02-28","2020-01-18","2020-01-18","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r739827077-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

The service was absolutely outstanding throughout. We arrived on Friday afternoon with a overnight booking. 

The rooms are marvelous and the whole area of the property is very nice. 

The food was top notch, alltough i must say that if i only had to judge the food without the surroundings like service, ambiance, location, etc, i would feel that it was a tad overpriced as i had comparable/equal quality menus for a lot less. 

Nevertheless, we got to meet and chat with the chef, an amazing and very charismatic person, which even had his sous-chef give us a tour of the kitchen. 

Overall it was outstanding & deserves it's reputation as best restaurant of Switzerland.","2","","NONE","2019-11-30","2020-01-14","2020-01-14","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r739046047-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

","I know... I promised in my past reviews I wouldn't have visited any more 3 Michelin star restaurants... But I did it again. 

And result was the same.  3 Michelin stars -and Michelin star rates restaurants in general- are the most impersonal restaurants I know. No character,  no passion,  it seems they cook to get 3 stars.  In the old days instead,  you got 3 stars because you cooked.

Anyway.... 

Amazing location in one of the best cantons of Switzerland. Very nice atmosphere and very private dining rooms.

Chef Caminada may be a great food engineer,  no doubt about that,  but what he is totally missing in my view is the connection to the territory. 

We are in a Canton full of great mountains... So why the hell do I need to feel Asian influence in my plates?  I wanna fell the mountains and its smell.  If I want to feel Asian I would go to an Asian restaurant! 

The endless pre entrees tastings were just too much.  And, again,  this is a new fashion -probably requested by Michelin so that you can get stars-,  which never existed in the older days where the heavyweight was food and not its design. 

I can't tenner any main dish I would order again.  But for sure I thought twice I was somewhere between Vietnam and Cambodia,  and not in fantastic Graubuenden. 

Sweets were not amazing at all,  although perfect from the outside. 

Wine list honestly disappointing. Even more disappointing was that I asked something to the Sommelier and he couldn't answer -and me,  I'm not a professor at all...  I just know a few things about wines!. 

Even more disappointing was the cheese dish.  I asked only one thing to the cheese dish waiter and,  again,  he couldn't answer.  And my question was SO basic!  I couldn't believe it. 

These 2 people,  with all due respect,  shouldn't be working at a 3 stars restaurant!  This shows exactly today's attitude.  Great plates,  great designs,  amazing engineering in the food...  And no substance behind that. No passion.  No heart.  

As much as I like you,  dear chef Caminada, you won't see me back unless you so profound changes to your kitchen...  You may loose some stars if you do that,  but you may make many more clients happy and become special also without stars.

Service: 3
Food: 5","5* food paired with 3* service","Schloss Schauenstein is an institution in Switzerland: most people have to book (and maybe even save) several months in advance, many come to celebrate a special occasion, and most people who dine here probably also regularly visit other fine dining establishments... so the expectations are very high.

We came for lunch - which is what we would recommend, as the entire meal lasted 5.5 hours, and we didn't eat for 16 hours afterwards. We've ordered the 6 courses meal, and my friend also ordered the wine pairing. As expected, the food was world class. Andrea Caminada, clearly, is a culinary artist. Excellent produce, stunning presentation, beautiful flavors. We especially loved the langoustine which was one of the best dishes I have eaten in my life. You get a huge selection of snacks and amuse-bouches before the starters, and I loved the small booklet to take home which included our menu as well as some seeds to plant at home. 

When you dine in a restaurant like Schloss Schauenstein, the service needs to be on a par with the food as it shapes your entire experience... you might not remember most of the dishes that you ate, but you will always remember how you felt when you were at the restaurant. In this regard, unfortunately, our expectations were not met. 

- The restaurant offers a free pick-up from Thusis which is very nice. We were warmly welcomed by a cheerful young lady who knew our names and immediately made us feel like we were old friends. 

- Schloss Schauenstein is a beautiful little castle, and all the surroundings are also very charming. We took our apéro with the first snacks on the pretty terrace, this is where we met our main server who didn't seem to like us very much. One of the various small snacks was a ""foie gras bonbon"" but because I had mentioned in advance that I don't like foie gras, I got a little tartlet as an alternative. My friend whispered to me that she had forgotten to mention that she doesn't like liver, so I asked the server if he could bring another tartlet, and the response was: ""The tartlet is the alternative for the person who had mentioned in advance that she does not eat foie gras."" (???) We did not get another tartlet, so I told her to eat mine. 

- We only had 3 tables in our room with 4 other people, and we counted 8 servers in total. Most of them were very friendly and nice, except the aforementioned gentleman who was professional but we could tell that he did not warm up to us. Unfortunately, I didn't ask for his name so let's just call him ""Mr. X"" for this review. 

- My friend got her first glass of wine and immediately said ""I can mostly smell dishwashing detergent"". She didn't say anything but when it happed again with the third glass of wine, she mentioned it and immediately got a new glass, but the waiter said that they had had the problem before and had tried various solutions... to no avail. If you have had this problem before, I just wonder why servers don't ""check"" glasses before pouring guests wine? At a restaurant of this calibre, you simply can't have glasses smelling of dishwashing detergent! 

- Mr. X didn't seem very well-informed with regards to the wines. He would e.g. confuse Spanish and Italian wines, even though he was looking at the bottles when he introduced them. 

- We absolutely loved the cheese course which came with various delicious snacks (cured meats, Maluns, a gorgeous panforte, tiny potatoes etc.). A lovely lady explained the different cheeses and put together a little selection for each one of us. At the end, she said that she'd be happy to come back if we'd like another piece of one of the cheeses. Because we loved the cheeses, we did want a little more cheese after we had finished. When we asked Mr. X, he was clearly not amused and told us, that the cheese cart was already gone but if we told him EXACTLY which cheese we wanted, he could MAYBE get us another small piece. I didn't remember the names of the cheeses that I wanted and because he seemed irritated, we just asked for the only one where we could remember details. At this point, our happy mood had vanished, because we felt like a nuisance.  

- Our neighbors couldn't finish their bread and asked to take it home with them. The waiters brought out a new bread in a nice box for them (very nice gesture), and when I saw that, I said (more as a joke) ""ohhh, I want one too!"". Mr. X then looked at me with indignation and said ""SERIOUSLY?"". 

- At one point, Mr. Caminada himself came out to say ""hello"". He was very professional but also seemed very reserved, it didn't feel like he enjoyed the interaction with the guests, and it was more of an obligation. Our neighbors celebrated their 22nd anniversary and had eaten at Schloss Schauenstein several times in the past. I would expect a Michelin*** restaurant to do something special for such an occasion, and I would expect the chef to know... but he didn't. The couple had to mention to him that they were here for their anniversary, Mr. Caminada said ""oh, congratulations"" and directly moved on to the next table.  

- We went back to the terrace for our coffee/tea and the petit fours (beautiful!). I wanted to order a jasmine tea (which is not a very unusual tea choice), and Mr. X told me that they didn't have it, because ""nobody else orders it"". Slightly disappointing as I'm a tea sommelier and would expect at least the most common tea choices in a restaurant like this. We chatted with the lovely couple next to us (who were celebrating their anniversary), and they told us that they had ordered 3 courses for CHF 216 + an extra foie gras starter. What they didn't know, and what nobody told them, was, that the foie gras starter was CHF 95.- extra = they ended up paying CHF 311 for 4 courses, when the 6 courses meal was only CHF 270. 

All in all, our experience confirmed why Andreas Caminada is one of the best chefs in the country: All his accolades are well-deserved, and the food was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the service was not. When I pay this kind of price for a meal, I expect the staff to go the extra mile to ensure that I have a fabulous experience, and I want them to HAPPILY bring me whatever I want. I want the same attention to detail which has been poured into all of the dishes which we ate that day. It's just such a pity that so many people work hard to create an experience for the guests but at the end of the day, you will mostly remember the weakest link... 

We went to IGNIV the next day and had a better time there: While the food was in our opinion on a similar level, the service was so much warmer, and we felt truly taken care of.","4","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-10-05","2019-10-05","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r715578014-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 5","Excellent meal, super expensive wine","My wife and I had a wonderful, but costly, experience dining here. The service was impeccable. The ambience was terrific, sitting on the terrace for apperitivi and snacks and later for coffee and dessert, as well as inside for our lengthy meal (since we chose to have multiple dishes from the menu rather than choose a la carte). There were multiple samples of amuse bouche as well as desserts served with the coffee, not counting the multiple different dishes on the menu. Frankly, we did not have any that we thought were less than very good, many were excellent, and also many were surprising in taste combinations we had not previously had nor considered. We have eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants; sometimes we have questioned their stars, but not the three stars awarded here. My only quibble was with the drinks: everything was very expensive. Wine on their selected list to compliment the meal was good but not really exceptional. Furthermore, comparing the price of two wines with which I was familiar on the list of their wines showed a mark-up of >3 times the price easily available elsewhere. My guess is that they make their profit on the wines to pay for the excellent service and food preparation that we experienced.","0","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-09-22","2019-09-22","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r711964898-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"

Food: 5","All I can say is WOW","My husband and I knew we wanted to take a fabulous trip to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had no idea where we wanted to go though. We love tasting menus so he did some research (shocking!!) and he discovered this amazing hotel & restaurant. We booked our entire trip around this hotel and restaurant. It was definitely worth it. We booked a night at the hotel in the castle and had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived to the train station in Thusis, we had a really kind woman (I can't remember her name though..) pick us up in an Audi A8 which of course my husband loved. She drove us to the castle and the minute we pulled up, I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew from the pictures that it was going to be incredible, but pictures don't do it justice. It is GORGEOUS! The grounds, the flowers, the castle...everything is picture perfect. Check in was super easy and she gave us a tour of the property so we knew where everything was. There are so many adorable little nooks and places on the property for various activities. I won't like - there were so many that I forgot them all! We went to the pool area for awhile, went to the beautiful lawn across from the castle, went to the terrace, went to another outdoor terrace for a few drinks....it was all just perfect. It was so quaint and beautiful, yet really welcoming which was nice.
When we got back to our room (we stayed in the Kastanie which has low ceilings, just FYI if you are traveling with anyone tall) and got settled in. The room is so charming. We loved it. Staying in the hotel was the perfect setting too. Anyway, we got a knock on our door while I was getting dressed in the bathroom, but it was the chef's wife! She explained there was a little issue with another hotel guest and the guest needed a special room to accommodate a health concern. My husband and I were happy to move rooms, so we packed our stuff and headed downstairs to the lobby. On our way down, we passed Marco (more about him later) and he was determined to carry our luggage for us, but my husband refused to let him. He was so kind and really wanted to carry it, but my husband is stubborn. Ha! Anyway, we ran into Sarah and Enna (I think that was how it's spelled) on the stairs. Enna oversees the dinner service I believe. They explained that the guest had solved their issue by switching with another couple they were with so we didn't have to change rooms after all. Sarah was soooo apologetic and kind, and we could tell she felt really bad about us packing our stuff. We really didn't mind though and we told her it was completely fine. I joked with her and told her I just wanted to meet her husband because I had researched the restaurant and the hotel and was seriously fascinated and inspired by him. She said she'd gladly tell him to come meet us during dinner. Needless to say, I was really excited.
We got dressed, and headed to one of the loveliest rooms for the Apertif. Words can't explain the beauty of this room. The ceiling detail was stunning and so beautiful. The walls were painted with these gorgeous paintings. I can't even describe it because it's simply stunning, but in a very charming and welcoming way. My favorite colors are pink and green and there were accents of them in the room, which also was just so pretty! They seated us at a small table and greeted us with a glass of complimentary champagne from Sarah. It was really nice of them. They also took our picture for our anniversary which was a perfect momento from our evening. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I won't go into detail, but the dinner was AMAZING. It was absolutely the most exquisite dinner we've ever had. It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. Marco was one of our main servers and he was the best. He was funny, charming, so kind and really made our experience an even better one. All of the service team was very nice. He and Alexander were the ones who really made the best impression because they were so friendly. We are from Texas and like to talk so they were really nice to talk to us. I could tell they read their diners really well because a few other diners didn't seem as chatty as we were and they weren't as chatty with them. Anyway, they were great. Towards the end of our dinner, Chef Andreas came to our table and talked to us. He was so friendly and it was surreal. I'd read so much about him so the fact that he comes and introduces himself and thanked us was so impactful. He greeted all the tables, but I asked him if I could take a picture with him and he said he'd be happy to. We went to the lobby, snapped a pic and mentioned to him that it would be great if he was around the next day so we could get a picture of him with something we'd brought (something from my husband's job which wouldn't make sense unless you're from Texas). He said he'd be around in the morning and to let the front desk know when we were available. We said bye, got a cocktail to go and walked outside to the terrace to look at the beautiful grounds again. They're illuminated at night and it's like a fairy tale.
The next day, we went to breakfast (which was soooo good. The croissants are the best I've ever had) and then we strolled around again and decided to stop at the Casa Caminada (his newest hotel property on the grounds which is a little more casual). It was really cool and obviously didn't have the history of the castle, but it was really beautiful, yet trendy, yet classic. Hard to explain. The floors are awesome though. Anyway, there is a bakery in there and a coffee area in the restaurant so we got a cup of coffee and went to sit outside. We had mentioned to the front desk that if Sarah or the Chef was around and available, that'd be great, but no worries if not. We didn't really think they'd come by, but about 5 minutes later, they did! We chatted for a bit, took another picture and Chef went to go about his day, but Sarah talked to us for a while. She is wonderful. If you get a chance to meet her, definitely do because she's one of the kindest women I've ever met. She and I had a lot in common because of kids, etc. so it was really nice talking to her and learning more about the hotels and IGNIV. If you don't know about it, look it up for sure. 
After a lovely chat with her, it was time for us to go back to the train station. I was so so sad to leave because it was just incredible, but it was the PERFECT anniversary in the perfect location. It's breathtaking and the food can't even be put into words. Simply put - if you're planning a trip to Switzerland, you MUST stay at this castle and dine at the restaurant. If you aren't planning a trip, do it because you won't regret it and you'll make memories that will last a lifetime. They made such a great impression on us and we absolutely cannot wait to go back.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/61/82/fa/us-with-the-chef-and.jpg

Attentive and knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, high level of complexity in courses and an interesting wine pairing. The most disappointing course was the cheese which I found unremarkable in taste and in which I believe made my stomach sour at the end of the evening. I could appreciate the time and care that goes into creating, preparing and serving a multitude of complexities on a dish, but in the end, it’s a long evening (from 19.00-almost 23.30 when we finally finished dessert in the main dining room) of hodgepodge different courses that don’t necessarily go together or complement each other. I was looking for more harmony in what was presented. I’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, this was the first 3* and I would hope that 3* and the prices that go with it would warrant something especially creative or special but it wasn’t my opinion of the evening at the Schloss. Everything was executed to an extremely high standard but it just failed the wow factor for me, it was just lacking soul. I left thinking that the price wasn’t worth the evening. It’s a pure question of taste, of course, as the quality is definitely there, but for me it was just a technically ambitious variety show of amouse bouche, tasting dishes and desserts. The expectations for a 3* restaurant are probably unreasonable, but I think the main reason people are drawn to these restaurants is to leave feeling inspired in one way or another by the chef’s creativity.  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I suspect that Caminada’s taste is perhaps just not my taste, and that’s ok, because it seems he impresses and inspires more than enough people!

For me, a restaurant has to satisfy me in three dimensions: Food - Ambiance - Staff and Andreas Caminada and his team make sure that all these dimensions are taken care of. You really feel welcome and at home, there are no stiff upper lips or french-style waiter snobbishness, everything goes easy but, as you can expect, is highly professional. This time round, we were very happy with the food which had the seasonal touch of fall-winter, but was still colorful and presented a happy contrast to the weather outside. Leave room for the cheese board which is full of excellent specialties from the region and even comes with some small blue local potatoes. Ms Junge does an excellent job with the wines. And last but not least, this is the restaurant where the chef shows presence, bids farewell to the guests. Overall, again a great experience.

And also in a nutshell, overwhelming. This comments reflects also the hotel experience... from the first contact up to the last view there is absolutely nothing to complain about. 

Hotel:
We stayed in the room ""Wasser"", which is a double room located at the top of the main building. As we arrived pretty early a very nice host showed us everything and explained all facilities and possibilities. You have to imagine, that this is a relatively small castle, but there are hints and secret corners to relax, to sunbath, to crab some food & wine - simply to enjoy. Many thanks to the complete staff.
But if you are interested to stay here, please have a closer look before choosing a room. In our room the shower was a bathtub in the middle of the room, the toilet was separated with translucent glass. Actually we liked it. 

Restaurant:
As many others wrote, marvellous. The weather was great, so we started with the aperitif and small snacks on the beautiful terrace. Here we also enjoyed the last glass of wine and petit fours after the marvellous dinner. Between these two delicacies we were faced a incredible genius menu, based only on local food (and it is incredible what is possible with this local stuff). Ok, two courses were weak compared to the others. But this is highly depend on personal taste. Last but not least not to forget the highly professional - but always with a twinkle in their eyes - staff. 

So even if you have to travel a lot to reach this restaurant, it is worth to do.","3","","COUPLES","2018-06-30","2018-08-02","2018-08-02","en","Schloss Schauenstein Restaurant","2069731","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r602025082-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html"
