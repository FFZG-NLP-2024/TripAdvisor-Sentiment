Atmosphere: 3","Massively over rated and over priced.","The restaurant is elegant and the service was suoperb.   The food was over complicated and virtually every dish was swimming in butter, or cream or both.  Every dish has some form of dairy - cream, cheese or butter.  The key ingredients were often buried by over complex and elaborate side ingredients that dominated the flavors.   Also, the price was $520 and not anywhere close to $350.    Would NOT recommend or return","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-21","2024-08-21","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r966056139-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

There are no words for me to say that will do this place justice. We had the most incredible food and the service was absolutely second to non. We always expect a certain level when we visit Michelin star accredited establishments, but this went beyond. The staff were so attentive but at the same time you didnt know they were there. Everything was so discreet. What a superb team of people and the best best food, so worthy of its two stars. We will be flying back to Copenhagen again in the near future just to visit Kadeau. If you havent been then get it on your list immediately!!","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-05-03","2024-05-03","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r949309886-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

I do recommend you going but have to warn on price  hence 4 stars - I spent £1300 on a meal for two with one middling bottle of wine and a shared flight of (amazing) fruit juices.   That is too much.    For that the food and atmosphere have to completely blow you away and that didn’t quite happen.

All of the menu is inspired by an Island between Sweden and Denmark which - best will in the world - restricts variety of ingredients although they are valiant with what they had.   The meal was amazing with much time and care obvious - stand out - walnut tart - but struggle with another big winner of the 14 courses.   Juice flight was stunning work - brilliant and I was mightily impressed and inspired by that - 

Each course had an explanation - whole thing spookily like the film “the menu” If you’ve seen it!    

Was I glad I went - yes very nearly.   The price feels wrong by about 20/30%.  But you can see where the cost comes from.   You can see I have mixed feelings as it’s a huge effort of will and creativity.   Restaurant was full too and all seemed happy - 

If you can afford reasonably easily - go.   If it’s a one off and you want your socks blown off - then it’s a maybe.","1","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-04-17","2024-04-17","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r947056992-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

The restaurant offers a fixed menu with 14 different servings, wine, or juice pairings (don't miss the incredible juice pairing). Dietary needs are considered (you have to tell them in advance). There are only eight tables; the kitchen is open-sight, and the chefs themselves serve the menu and explain ingredients and preparation. The style is minimalistic, with the accent on fish, vegetables, and preserves, most of them coming from the island of Bornholm. The service is impeccable, and the ambiance is friendly and elegant.

The food was well presented and so unique - flavors we wouldn't have just anywhere. The space and team were so warm and friendly - the waiters were very chatty and made us feel welcome. Some nice restaurants are pretentious, but Kadeau was humble and inclusive. Good cocktails (we event went to Ruby bar the next day) and wine pairing.

If not, I don't know what else to tell you. Nor do I have the vocabulary to tell you how good the food was, or the extreme hygge we were enthralled by at the end of the night. I would actually get the juice pairing over the wine to get an additional suite of tastes that you haven't had before.

Food: 5","A most memorable meal in an exquisite setting...","What a little gem: small and intimate, elegant in every detail - from the dark and woody interior to the masterful light that made the patrons and the food the focus of attention, to the inviting inner courtyard with plants, flowers and herbs (some of which during the evening ended up on our plates), to the incredibly knowledgable and caring staff, to the super friendly chefs that did not skip a beat at the kitchen. Every bite was a delightful explosion of flavors, probably with the exception of one - pork - which was delicious yet a little heavy for me (mostly because I am less of a carnivore than I thought I was). Worth repeats and definitely worth a visit, especially if you are looking for a smaller, not-pretentious-yet-exquisite fine dining location in Copenhagen","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/73/b0/34/a-few-snapshots-from.jpg

The team was amazing and attentive and there when needed, but otherwise not hovering. Everyone was friendly and it was a pleasure seeing how the kitchen staff worked on the dishes. 

Except for the prawns which were a little too rich for me, all dishes were amazing -- especially the peas wrapped in fig leaves which reminded me of a Peruvian childhood dish. The smoked salmon was to die for, so was the hake. Desserts were delicious, too. 

The vibe was not pretentious or stiff at all, which made the evening even more fun. Definitely worth 2 Michelin stars! ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/6f/7d/70/caption.jpg

Every dish was beautifully presented by knowledgeable chefs, their care and enthusiasm for what they had created was infectious and elevated their creations to a level I have not previously experienced. The wine pairing was presented expertly and knowledgeably and perfectly complimented each and every dish. It would seem unfair to single out individual dishes as each course was stunning but the hot and cold smoked salmon with onion and lavender was salmon on a whole new level. As for the Queen scallop ice cream what genius not only conjures that one up but executes it to perfection!

Where every dish is a culinary masterpiece and an objet d’art in the skilled hands of its many passionate sous-chefs under the direction of its chef. A soft spoken man with an eye for detail. This establishment is a 2 star Michelin deserving the third. It is understated maintaining an air of hospitality than arrogance away from the normal attitude of restaurants at its level. Attire is INFORMAL which bodes nicely and removes all pretence from its guests and staff. Every member of the staff is conversant on the particulars of each dish. This epitomises their passion for their craft and not some burnt out staff waiting to collect a paycheque with an air of arrogance that one sees and expects from restaurants of this calibre.

A little disappointing that the none fish option was either vegetables or they just couldn’t bother making the effort, enclosed a photo of the caviar dish served for two.

Other than not catering for none fish eaters everything else was delicious and exquisite, the sea urchins dish was superb as was the prawn and caviar. The wild duck had a wonderful gamy flavour. Outstanding flavours throughout. Unfortunately we found the juice flight very disappointing, would of like more herbal  flavours rather than sweet fruit flavours","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/21/40/c9/45/caviar-dish-for-two.jpg","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-29","2021-10-29","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r816576643-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

Copenhagen is deserving a food capital nomination at par with Tokyo and San Sebastian. This is a Nordic version of a Japanese Kaiseki dinner. Service couldn’t be friendlier.

So rarely have I had a tasting menu where every dish was a joy to eat. Each plating was served at the table by a different chef; it was a wonderful and personable way to get to meet all the kitchen staff. Rasmus curated our drinking experience with warmth and great humor, and Daniel kept an eye on our table so we never wanted for anything. This was an evening I will remember for a long, long time.","1","","NONE","2021-09-30","2021-09-10","2021-09-10","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r809299382-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

Service is flawless and the definition of gracious without being haughty in the slightest.  The dishes are food as art, and the ingredients are the epitome and essence of themselves if that makes sense.  As fine as dining gets and distinctions in this ethereal realm between 2 and 3 star Michelin eateries are hard to discern.  The only tiny critique: the non-alcohol drink pairings were a little one-not and on the sweet-tangy side.  A couple had the main fruit juice component overwhelm the other flavors.  A bit more variation with tonics, bitters, kombuchas and the like would elevate the “flight.”","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/bc/37/9f/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2021-08-31","2021-08-29","2021-08-29","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r807063539-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

Best meal we had for years, and truly a 2 Michelin Star experience, which can not be said about all Michelin Star restaurants...

Great service and knowledgeable staff going out of their way to answer our many questions, highly recommendable!","1","","NONE","2021-06-30","2021-06-17","2021-06-16","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r792870595-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"

The cuisine is regional, yet they are inspired by the whole world. 
They cultivate their own herbs, vegetables, fruits, and berries, and the result of these dishes that are coming from a Danish Island located in the Baltic Sea in the south of Sweden is surprising.
It’s not cheap but it’s worth trying it... 
The team is super nice, the service impeccable and the location hidden.

We loved it. ","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/a6/64/9e/photo7jpg.jpg

Food: 5","An Amazing Culinary Experience in Copenhagen","A truly unique culinary experience. This was an 18 course, four hour extravaganza that is a real splurge but well worth it for the experience. The staff was truly amazing. It was not the typical stuffy 2 star  Michelin restaurant. It was real fun as the staff freely interacted with the guests in conversation about their backgrounds, the food and anything else you might like to engage them with. The chef graciously showed us how some of the dishes were prepared. The food was truly amazing Danish modern. Many of the ingredients were organic from their farm in Bornholm, where they also foraged for some of the more unusual ingredients. 
though it currently does not have the cache of Noma, it is on par with it .It truly is an experience not to be missed if it is in your budget and culinary liking. Though it is stirictly a prix fixe they are more than willing to accomodate your likes and dislikes and any reasonable dietary restrictions. Just let them know when you make the reservation.","4","","NONE","2019-08-31","2019-09-08","2019-09-08","en","Kadeau Copenhagen","3842483","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d3842483-r707981375-Kadeau_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html"
