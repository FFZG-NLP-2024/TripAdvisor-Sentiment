Food: 5","A one-of-kind experience in a top-notch setting","We could only secure a table for lunch and the last one at that, several months in advance...
Setting: top of a hill, bay windows with views of wild grasses flowing in the wind and trees in the distance. Large dining area, airy, light and comfortable. 
We all had the degustation menu and the execution was outstanding in all respects: exquisite presentation, perfect execution. Excellent service. We had a total of 6 courses with many ""amuse bouches"" in between; We never waited more than a few minutes before being presented with a dish or some preparation meant to intrigue us.   We were a mixed French/American family and party of five and the staff was at ease conversing with everyone in their preferred language,
I would venture that such an experience should be lived once (at least).
We would definitely return if we could plan our visit far enough in advance.","0","","NONE","2022-08-31","2022-09-01","2022-08-31","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r857728470-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","Expensive But So Excellent A Dining and Hotel Experience","When any French Michelin 3 star restaurant chef/owner tells me that he appreciates my comments about a fairly priced wine list and not gouging his customers with only a list of expensive bottles, as so many of his peers do,  I know I am going to love his place. And we did. What a meal. Reserving for the few spots six months in advance so worth it. From the glorious surroundings of the dining room itself to the exquisite menu and all the extra little dishes that show up along the way. Mushroom foods and things everywhere. Everything is so creative and delicious. Each course a delight. The service so superb—even beyond expectations. The wines we chose by the glass and bottle so reasonably priced. One of the major complaints I have had over the years in France is dining at these 2 and 3 and stars and leaving feeling abused by the wine prices. Regis and Jacques disagree with their expansive and fair list list but many under 100 euros for the bottle, and reasonable by the glass, too. A tour of the kitchen conducted by Jacques himself and the fromage room just splendid. The breakfast looking out into the countryside  equally a delight. The hotel itself built into the side of the Auvergne hill is so interesting and rooms so comfortable. Perfect. Well worth the cost. Travel to little St. Bonnet Le Froid and enjoy the total experience.","1","","NONE","2022-05-31","2022-05-31","2022-05-31","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r840818759-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","Son and Dad around the same passion","Nested in the middle of nowhere, there is little chance that you come to the village by chance. Like Vonnas and Georges Blanc, the village lives thanks to the Marcon. At the entrance, there is a nice bar, and you can buy souvenir or food in one of the shops. And the village keeps its true character.
If you do not have the chance to have a room in the main hotel, no problem. We stayed in the Clos des Cimes and everything was nice. The restaurant is some hundreds meter from the hotel but there is a limousine service that takes you to the restaurant and back. So, you can let your own car in the dedicated parking for the night.  
The dining room is very elegant, and the view is just great. We were there for dinner but visited the dining room at daylight and the landscape is so beautiful and very changing (we had bright day coming and fog and storm the next morning when departing). 
I suggest, as meals are prepared according to the seasons to follow the Maitre d’Hotel’ suggestions, do not worry, all is just excellent, fine, well-prepared and good-looking. Staff is great, kind and very professional. The sommelier we had was very helpful and made us discovered some unknown designation.
Among all 3 stars restaurant we visited, the Marcon is the one of the most exotic one which brings us a very refreshing break even in our own country.","2","","NONE","2020-09-30","2021-08-12","2021-08-12","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r803363742-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 4","airy location, airy food","I've dined here several times over the past 20 years or so.  I've always liked it, but after the last couple of visits I'm geting the impression that the recipes are going off in a somewhat different direction, with very lightweight, gelatinous, frothy textures that don't really seem to satisfy my tastebuds.  It may be my own taste that has changed over the years, but the menu does mention that they are making an effort to serve light, healthy food...  Anyway, I find the cooking impressive, and I enjoy tasting all the various mushrooms, but the final effect doesn't quite hit the spot for me anymore.  By the way, be sure to reserve months in advance, it's hard to get a table!","0","","NONE","2019-10-31","2020-01-05","2020-01-05","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r737105846-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","It gets better every year","We always hope to visit this restaurant when we visit St Bonnet and have been doing so for many years.  I have already reviewed the restaurant several times, but feel that I should repeat my views, for me eating anywhere in the world does not get any better than this.  

This really is the best meal I have ever eaten.  

The menu follows the seasons and the traditions of this part of France.

It is not just the great food, lovingly prepared and to an extent based on local traditional recipes and produce, but the whole ambience.  Great food, great service, great wines, but without the pretentiousness of many one star or two stars in France, let alone three stars. Everyone can feel comfortable here.

The service here is immaculate, attentive and efficient, without being overbearing.  The dining room is wonderfully managed and the sommelier, so well informed and helpful.

If the food and service was not enough the location is superb, with views from the dining room over meadows and the Doux valley.

If you visit here keep your eyes open you may spot the red kite or other raptors soaring over the valley from the dining room.

This is the place I will always want to return to, as long as I can continue to travel.","0","","NONE","2019-07-31","2019-08-27","2019-08-27","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r703572904-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

The whole evening was an amazing experience from start to finish. The staff were by and large very impressive, attentive and helpful without being intrusive. We decided to go for the full tasting menu with matching wines. The wines were delicious and matched perfectly but we would have enjoyed more description, albeit we appreciate our language differences may have been the reason for this. The food was amazing, with mushrooms playing a part in most of the courses. I wondered how someone who didn’t like mushrooms would fare but we were reassured that they would happily cope with this or any other dietary requirement. A highlight of the evening was a trip around the kitchen when we were able to meet the charming Regis Marcon. A night to remember. Thanks so much. 
I have included only 3 photos. Most of my photos were taken after I started the course!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/02/31/7c/photo2jpg.jpg

It was always going to be a challenge for me, as a guy why simply detests mushrooms! That, in a restaurant who’s greatest Signiture Dishes are based around some of the very best mushrooms from around the world, you get the picture. I lost count after course number 10 but the whole experience was one that I can only hope I experience somewhere again as it was total perfection. From our arrival to departure, totally seamless and possibly in one of the most beautiful restaurants in the world.

From the early evening to the end of all courses - I don't remember how many - late at night our small group was hosted professionally but with no pressure at all. In the moments we had a question somebody was right away with us, but we never noticed anybody waiting for us. The proposals of the servers were relaxed, friendly and always with a valuable choice. Even we were eating all the time and for hours we did not feel overindulged, and we were not hungry either... :-D","0","","BUSINESS","2018-11-30","2019-03-14","2019-03-14","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r658403452-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","Definitely a destination","One definition of a Michelin 3 restaurant is it is a destination. This one truly was for us. We were traveling Southern France and Switzerland and based on a friend's good raves, we sidestepped by a 3 hour drive and 24 hours of our itinerary to experience Regis & Jacques Marcon's restaurant and lodging. It is definitely a highlight of our entire trip and will be an everlasting special memory. To begin with the hotel was amazing. The pictures did not impress me so I was expecting to be underwhelmed. Instead I encountered minimalism but in the design hands of architectural genius. Even the parking garage was amazing! The meal also went beyond expectations. The food was creative and balanced and delicious, the service was attentive, and after 4 hours of eating what had to be 17 or more courses we were pleased to only have a few steps to walk to our room!

I am devoting another paragraph to give some help in getting reservations. The diners are mostly French and the staff is all French although most had a decent comfort with speaking English. However, I found the securing of reservations very confusing. Their website is only in French and all of their email communications were only in French. There is a restraint on advanced reservations. When I was finally allowed to make our reservations I could not find a way on the website to reserve a single night at the main lodging. I therefore sent an email and was promptly given confirmation of our lodging for 1 night and our dinner. (There is an alternative lodging but if you are going the distance go the whole way!) With the confirmation email which, again was in French, we had a very detailed instruction on how to secure the reservation. It involved going to our local bank and they had to transfer the money to the French bank. We have never had to make such a transfer for a reservation before and having it all instructed in French was difficult for us as well as for our banker! The good news is that we had an amazing experience.","0","","COUPLES","2018-06-30","2018-06-22","2018-06-22","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r589776904-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","Unforgettable experience","This is more an experience than a meal. Experimental flavours, incredible presentation, generous additions (we counted more than 19 'courses'). It's the sort of meal that stays with you for the next day in the memory of the tastes and textures. The only disappointment was that during the evening of our visit there was a lengthy power cut (2-3 hours). The staff ensured a fantastic atmosphere by candlelight and it's quite incredible that they managed to continue to cook and present such amazing food working by candlelight and cooking on gas in the kitchen. All the same, it meant some delays, which led to us waiting long periods in between the early courses, and being rushed through the final courses. In the end the meal we started at 8:30pm didn't finish until 1am. I credit the staff for continuing, and it didn't affect the quality of the food, but had we known in advance (the power cut was before we arrived) then I think we would have postponed, because we were so tired towards the end of the meal that we appreciated it less than we might have done. I would advise people to go for lunch, in order to enjoy an afternoon of culinary excellence without getting sleepy!","0","","FRIENDS","2018-06-30","2018-06-10","2018-06-10","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r586390296-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","The mushroom king!","One of the specialties of this fine restaurant is the local mushrooms, which of course are available in abundant variety in October.  I was served a little frying pan containing an assortment of delectable mushrooms, and the chefs also used them to good advantage in the recipes.  I've dined here 4-5 times over the years and have always been satisfied.  The standout dish for me this time was the perfectly cooked rouget--one of the two best fish dishes I have ever eaten--with its tender, juicy flesh and crispy skin, accompanied by delicious sauces and vegetables.  The cooking style in general is light and airy, without much fat; still, I ended up feeling stuffed after a ""small"" menu, and the couple at the table next to me had to ask their waiter to omit a considerable portion of the (larger) menu they had ordered, because they were already full!  There are a lot of little extras along the way, so I think the chefs need to scale down the quantity of food served here.  The dining room is spacious and comfortable, featuring large windows that offer a pleasant view of the hills and forest during daylight hours.","0","","SOLO","2015-10-31","2015-11-13","2015-11-13","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r326531594-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Food: 5","Friendly and Perfect","My wife & I stayed at Clos des Cimes which belongs to this group. When comfirming my reseravation, they offer that the seats are available for dinner, and I accepted it immediately, of course. There is limousine service to and from the restaurant. The car is not limousine but big luxury SUV. Driver took us to the restaurant reception. Restaurant is gorgeous and should have panoramic view in daytime. In consideration of our appetite & capacity, we will order 2 or 3 dishes course, but floor manager highly recommended 'Tasting course'. He said they can prepare small portion for each dish. He was right. I could enjoy from starter to dessert with greatest satisfaction. When the starter was served, I was really surprised, not was impressed. In my impression, it will show picking nice food from the forest. Following it, all did not betray may expectation. During the course, we are offered kichen tour. It was very impressive as well. He, Chef Regis, has absolute confidence for his policy.  Dinner ended up around 23:00.
Next morning, when I had morning walk around our hotel, big SUV stopped in front of Bistro and a guy got out. He was Regis and after I said hellow to him, he went into the Bistro kitchen. He must be a hard worker.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/76/86/45/surprising-presentation.jpg

Food: 5","A top gastronomic experience !","We went there for dinner and one night at the Relais & Châteaux hotel. We took the discovery menu which comprises of six courses (properly sized so that you enjoy each and every one) + cheese + dessert not including mignardises and a couple of other surprises. The meal was outstanding be it for fish, meat and of course vegetables (asparagus, forgotten vegetables...) / mushrooms (morels) which are a local specialty. The waiter offered a visit of the kitchen where the chef and the entire squad work with razor sharp efficiency and smile  The dining area oversees the mountain and it is beautiful and peaceful to look at. The architecture of the building is a mixture of modern style and more local treats. You are in the middle of nowhere in the mountain (1.200 m high) with fog pretty often which gives a rather surealistic touch to the experience that my wife, my father and I loved. As we said during dinner, this is in restaurants like this that you experience what ""the Genius of French cuisine"" is. Even though this is an expensive meal (you are in a 3-star Michelin restaurant), you pay a fraction of the price that you would pay in Paris for the same experience. You can run there for a 24-hour romantic getaway eyes closed! The rooms of the hotel are very cosy as well. we will most definitely come back.","3","","FAMILY","2015-04-30","2015-04-23","2015-04-23","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r267485210-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"

Everything from the views (both in the room and the dinning-room) to the overall feel of quality in the place is remarkable. Food is breathtaking, the tasting menu, recommended by the restaurant manager, is worth every penny. The service is flawless and the dishes (about a dozen) come and go at a very steady stomac friendly pace, We spent 4 hours dinning and it did not feel that long at all, the theme is clearly ""mushroom everything"" and the chef is truly a master when it comes to cooking them and making them part of the experience (you even get mushroom shaped sugars with your coffee!).
Pricing is high as you'r dinning in a 3 michelin stars restaurant but compared to a similar place in a big capital city it isn't bad at all.We only found one thing a bit odd, none of the silverware was polished, it was very strange for this kind of establishment but maybe there is a eco concept behind it (the entire hotel complex is built with green sustainable enery in mind)?","1","","COUPLES","2015-04-30","2015-04-13","2015-04-12","en","Restaurant Regis & Jacques Marcon","967560","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g950950-d967560-r265394119-Restaurant_Regis_Jacques_Marcon-Saint_Bonnet_le_Froid_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_.html"
