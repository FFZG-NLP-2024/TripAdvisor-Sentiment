Set in the beautiful countryside in a renovated barn, this is an institution of French cooking. The food is fantastic, yes, but it's the whole package that elevates the experience, especially if you stay at the hotel. 

Every guest at dinner is given the chance to tour the kitchen, and your table is yours for the night. We walked through the gardens earlier in the day and saw a chef coming out of a poly tunnel - that's how fresh some ingredients are. And although the classic salmon and sorrel dish is not part of the menu anymore, the kitchen will happily cook it for you ahead of time. The acidity and freshness of each dish comes through in every bite, and I didn't feel overly stuffed at the end. 

After dinner, both Michel and César appeared in the dining room, and César stopped by each table, even though it was Sunday. Truly a special meal if you get the chance to eat here.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/6e/ac/63/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","Great Cooking","Having visited Troisgros 20 years ago and enjoyed a fine experience at both their inn and restaurant, we were inspired to make a return trip after watching the four-hour film ""Menus-Plaisirs – Les Troisgros,"" a 2023 documentary edited, co-produced, and directed by the esteemed filmmaker Frederick Wiseman. The film delves into the Troisgros family's operation of their Michelin-starred restaurant in central France.

Their new restaurant and hotel were wonderful, offering a Michelin three-star experience (unlike some three-star restaurants that I believe deserve only one star or none). The food was delicious, from the simple asparagus to the Charolais steak. The selection of cheeses was impressive, with probably about 50 varieties available. Dessert was also good, and the service was excellent. The food's presentation is not particularly artistic, the focus here is more on taste.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-07-03","2024-07-03","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r957875686-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

Part of the experience is the beautiful location and the buildings as well.
The menu, presentation and quality  is without need of explanation and reflects the 4 generations of Michelin stars.

Food: 4","excellent and consistent","Troisgros is among the iconic 3 star restaurants in France and indeed in the world. Cesar Troisgros has taken over from his father Michel in the fourth generation, and the culinary sparkle is still there. We chose to eat à la carte, and all dishes were very good to excellent to memorable. Cesar Troisgros is not afraid to offer some bold flavour combinations, such as in the (cold) starter of langoustines with vegetables (beetroot ravioli) and flowers. The aiguillette de saint pierre au shizo was superb, showing some of the Japanese inspirations of the chef (he had some training in Japan).  Only my dessert, an Ali Baba with pear au calvados, was not quite in the same league.
We had a superb bottle of 2014 Meursault Coche Dury and a half bottle of 2006 Santenay. Service was superb throughout, and we had very nice chats with Michel and Cesar Troisgros. Take all that together with the superb  setting and the magnficently designed V-shaped dining room with glass fronts throughout designed by Patrick Bouchain, and you have a memorable experience.","0","","FAMILY","2023-07-31","2023-07-18","2023-07-18","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r903855749-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

The location is stunning, simply as beautiful as it gets. The Maison is built in such a way as to make it seem that you are dining in the middle of nature, in the middle of the forest. From the bread to the last dish of the tasting menu I've had, everything was just delicious. The style of the cooking here is my favorite one : perfect textures and memorable sauces with acidity to be the host. Just perfect for my taste. I don't know if this big Maison is the best restaurant in the world because I've not been in every restaurant of the world but I can surely say that this is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. The level here is unattainable. Spectacular service and a spectacular wine list with correct prices. Five is not enough, it deserves six balls as a mark in TripAdvisor.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/e2/54/cb/troisgros.jpg

Food: 5","Fantastic but ....","We are part of a group of diners (Gastropotes) and went as a group of 10 friends on Oct 19th for our annual fine and exclusive diner. 

Menu découverte for us. Fantastic dining experience. A great progression in the  dishes. Top quality, top service top everything. You do not get *** from Michelin by accident. The dining room and the place is close to extraordinary. 

All this said, at some point you get a bill. We had chosen local wines 125 & 250 EUR / bottle. Nothing fancy. 388 EUR / p at the end ! 28 EUR  (x 10) for the welcoming cocktail ... (which was very good)

My point is we all have a psychological price we ca accept. Clearly above my standard here. We have tasted last year 2* Michelin which was nearly as good at less than 1/2 the price !  

Do not get me wrong ... This is a UNIQUE experience. It is worth the trip from anywhere on the planet. But ... too expensive in my opinion and you do not get the 'value'. Purely a personal appreciation.  

NB: Can't you offer different type of bread during the service ? That was truly  cheap :(","3","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-10-25","2019-10-25","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r721320872-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

I was curious what a 51 years in a raw 3star restaurant could still have to discover. The place itself as well as the cuisine took some risks: probably decoration as well as culinary choices were taken at risk and this is precisely the reason why you feel like nowhere else. Don't take me wrong, I would never dear talk about ""faute de goût"". I am saying that experience here includes risk into the model. I would not share my views on the taste of the food as we are all unique and taste is personal. But I would certainly advise you to live the Troisgros experience fully, staying at the hotel being part of it. Some goodies can be purchased such as beautiful glaces, water carafes, oil lamps... at the lobby. The key word experience for me is ""TASTE"".","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/43/93/2b/troisgros.jpg","COUPLES","2019-04-30","2019-04-23","2019-04-23","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r668639174-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

This is the first critical  review I have given.
I have read the reviews from others, many of which are excellent, but  importantly there are marked similarities with our experience and others critical comments, that for me indicates a worrying trend.
Before I get into the detail it is important to remember that many guests are, like us, coming to celebrate life’s milestones and achievements. The questions for you are why do we and why is  a 3 star restaurant so often a choice. 
I think it is because we expect you to create a sense of wonder, of excellence, of the weaving of beauty and surprise.
We want to be charmed and amazed by your creativity and skill
I didn’t experience this particularly through the food.
The restaurant setting and architecture are stunning and as the outer layer they are marvelous.
The next layer are the staff and their skills.
There were inexperienced. One would talk to us in English and another in rapid French that we cannot follow.
When we questioned a wine match we were just told why it was made and our left over wine was just removed.
They leant over us to serve rather than walk around. When a fly landed in my wife’s glass and crawled out the waiter just shooed it away and left.
Towards the end of the meal the staff  were saying goodbye to each other in the restaurant. This regular pattern of life is not what we come for.
The food itself was simple. It could not create wonder because it was so obvious. I know what kidney and crayfish looks and tastes like with or without fruit flavors although they were so small I couldnt wonder about the flavor but about how little it must have cost.
The panna cotta on the melon is still as others have said totally overpowered by the hastily cut melon slice under it.
There were no wonderful dishes.
The whole tasting menu came out quickly and coupled with the wine pairing per course we were drinking too fast and eating too little. We felt rushed and processed.
This continued for the whole meal.
I sat for a while and asked to speak to the most senior staff in charge. They asked if I wanted an autograph....
His reply was I didn’t understand what they were trying to achieve which was elegant simplicity and it wasn’t possible to please everyone.
There is a fine line between elegant simplicity and plain simplicity and I think it has been crossed.
I don’t need to pay these prices for simplicity.
There was no beauty or wonder in the food experience for us. We felt like a profit centre.
Today we went to Lameloise that restored our faith.","2","","COUPLES","2018-09-30","2018-09-28","2018-09-28","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r620300185-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"

As for the food, it is a HUGE disappointment! Pictures speaks for themselves, very poor preparation, absolutely no taste for at least 3 dishes. Only one sort of bread, nothing worth more than 1 Michelin star. We have been visiting other 3 Michelin stars restaurant (Pic,Donkel,Marcon,Savoy,Blanc,Ducasse) and I would definitely not put Troisgros on the same level. Yes you do have a great background and atmosphere to eat, everything is clean, the chef actually comes and greet you but at the end of the day, SERVICE and obviously the FOOD are the main things you are expecting to be top notch , especially at 270 euros per head...

Please save yourself some money and visit a better place to enjoy an actual # Michelin stars restaurant!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/41/69/ec/not-worth-it-just-a-fish.jpg

Food: 5","One of the finest in the world...","It took me 40 years to get to dine at this temple of gastronomy and in their new location in Oches.   A bit hard to find but well worth it.  Cab fare from the train station is about 16 -17 E .  

  The new location in Oches is incredible as it the decor and visual stimulus on a spring day  is worthy of mention.   It doesn't get much better that this 
This place is legendary and I went with the full tasting menu with pared wines about 450E, with service included which for a place of this caliber for a 3.5 hour meal is not unreasonable..  
   I noted  that they do have a mini menu for children.   However  I dont recommend this place for for children  who can not grasp the experience any more than they could at Burger King.   ( I did see an american couple who brought their 7 and 8 yearold girls to dine.  The girls wore head phones and played with their phones the whole time oblivious to everything...What a sad waste)
I traveled here from LA...6000 miles just for the experience as a pilgrim to a shrine. Cuisine has always interested me to the extent I took professional training to better appreciate its nuances.The tasting menu is 7 courses  + 3 amuse and +3 deserts 

It was a further treat to me to be invited into the kitchen to talk with the chefs, who were both as great at their meals. Chef.Ceasar Troisgros has studied  with Thomas Keller of the French Laundry, and several of his dishes reflected some of Kellers technique.. It was a pleasure to watch the brigade from Gard to Sous working with such focus and attention to detail.    I think I enjoyed that experience as much as I did the meal.   It was food for the soul.
    The wait staff, too, was warm and outgoing, and eager and would carefully explain in detail each course answering detailed questions as to ingredients. 

At Troisgros, turn your self over to their  skill and passion. you will not regret it. I have dined around the world seeking out the best of the best  Troisgros is one of the finest and has held 3*** with Michelin  for 50 years !!      Come here with  having done some research and reading in it's history and  background. and it will be more fulfilling than you can immigine !!!!

I liked it a whole bunch................... ..","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/b2/8c/cb/dining-room-in-glass.jpg

This new place is stunning architecturally but the cooking has not changed. Great food and service. Get the ""menu"" - It changes seasonally. These are great cooks - let them serve you what is the best on the current market. Very expensive - worth every $.

Excellent service - though sometimes a little too fast! Interesting range of wines. Unusual architecture but allows for well spaced tables. Really enjoyed the ""drunken mussels"" - through my serving  was predominantly other shellfish - and the oyster dish. I was surprised that the cod fish went so well with cocoa! I was surprised that the amuse bouche and the first course of the trading menu were so similar in composition (and taste) and the pana cotta was rather lacking in any flavour.","0","","FRIENDS","2017-10-31","2017-10-19","2017-10-19","en","Troisgros","12334831","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r534371301-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html"
