This was our fourth visit to La Cote Saint Jacques, spanning four decades. We had a wonderful time at this extraordinary venue. La Cote Saint Jacques has continued to evolve and reach new heights during its long and illustrious history. There is no better “base” from which to enjoy the marvelous wines and the charming village of Chablis and the villages of northern Burgundy.

We note that although Michelin has awarded two stars to LCSJ, in our judgment, LCSJ has always been a three star experience, offering far warmer hospitality and spectacular cuisine than we have experienced at three MIchelin star establishments in Burgundy and throughout France. In fact, we have had disappointing experiences at three star restaurants both with respect to the food and service at other venues, which pale in comparison to the service, graciousness and superb cuisine of LCSJ.

From the moment of arrival, guests are greeted warmly by the Lorain family and its long time staff, led by Marine Lorain. Ms. Lorain is deeply committed to maintaining the family’s great traditions of hospitality which extends over three generations and begins a fourth generation. As in past years, the service throughout our visit was impeccable, from the housekeeping to the spa and the massage therapy was excellent.

Sine our last visit, rooms at this “country inn” have been renovated. The accommodations are spacious; the bathrooms generously proportioned. Many rooms have views of the Yvonne River. The hotel  is situated on the bank of the river; its grounds have been beautifully landscaped, featuring spectacular cast iron sculptures from Sylvain Subervie which are illuminated at night.

The cuisine at La Cote Saint Jacques is extraordinary, a reflection of the culinary wizardry of Jean-Michel Lorain, now joined in the kitchen by his talented nephew, Alexandre Bondoux. In past years, the exceptional cuisine at LCSJ may have been considered to be “classical”; it has evolved and reached new heights, brilliantly marrying classical French techniques with modern, international influences. It is astonishingly refined and delicious. LCSJ also offers instructive cooking classes which we have enjoyed during previous visits. 

Our dinners at LCSJ had many highlights, from the ethereal oyster terrine to the Flottante with Caviar, richly textured foie gras de canard, delicate blanquette de hommard and outstanding Ris de Veau (with ginger accents) to Agneau de lait des Pyrenees, a springtime lamb delight. However, the “piece de resistance” of our weekend was a birthday surprise for my wife - a magnificent Poulet de Bresse cooked in a coquette sealed with pastry dough and served with a melange of baby vegetables cooked with the famous Bresse bird. The Poulet de Bresse in coquette, a traditional technique for this renowned bird, was the idea of Matthias Lermercier, the restaurant’s adroit and acutely attentive manager and Stephen Guyard, the Maitre ‘ d who was our culinary guide throughout the weekend.Mr. Guyard is one of the most skilled, knowledgeable and gracious servers we have ever encountered in France. For a birthday dessert, Mr. Guyard presented a stunningly delicious “Mille Feuille”  with the lightest of crème filling, a fitting end to this incredible evening, a perfect interplay of opulence and elegance.

Together,  Matthias and Stephen worked to ensure that this was a special celebratory weekend for my wife and helped us to navigate through the spectacular dishes coming from the Lorain-Bondoux kitchen. Together with the outstanding Chablis and Burgundy in the LCSJ cellar (including a 2012 Les Clos from Dauvissat and a 2017 Valmur  from Raveneau), we had dinners that ranked among the finest we have had  -  truly at a three Michelin star level. The service in the restaurant  from Stephen and Matthias was so remarkably gracious and professional (and with abundant good humor), that it was reminiscent of the legendary service team at Taillevent from its late, revered owner Jean-Claude Vrinat and his long time lieutenants, Jean-Frederic Guidoni and Jean-Marie Ancher.
We thank the Lorain family and the entire La Cote Saint Jacques team for its extraordinary hospitality. We look forward to returning to this elegant and magical venue.

We thank the Lorain family for a memorable weekend and extraordinary hospitality. We look forward to returning to this magical venue.

The lunch menu was small but lovely - our highlights were the lobster starter, duck main course and raspberry desert all of which were exceptional. 

The wine pairings were good though perhaps a little predictable. Service was excellent and there is an English version of the menu and good level of English for most staff. 

Definitely recommended if you’re looking for something special - with prices that are high as you’d expect from a 2 star Michelin restaurant. 

Do book well in advance.

Food was great, service excellent despite the COVID and the mask weared by all staff .  My only point of unpleasementless was the sommelier which was quite passive and did not help us to make the best choise. 
I recomment the Ile flottante au caviar “Kristal“ and the lamb as well as the Homard “Pattes bleues“.

Food: 1","This thing is a rape of a restaurant","We wanted to visit this restaurant since September this year (2017) and we finally ended up going in December. It was a disappointment. First of all, it is in the middle of nowhere, we drove 2 hours from Paris (where we live) to get there. 

Since we arrived at 7:00PM and the restaurant opens at 7:30PM, we were kindly invited to sit in the hotel lunge area and had a cocktail and an 'amuse bouche'. Then, the waiter asked us, @7:45PM if we wanted to be escorted to pour table: we gladly said yes, and got up... by the time we did, he was gone, and we would up sitting there for a good 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us what we want. For a Michelin restaurant with pretentions, this is unacceptable in terms of service.

The restaurant is at -1 on the hotel's floor plan: while descending with the elevator, my wife remarked it reminded her of going down to the OR when she had her last surgical operation. 

The dishes are well prepared, at least for the main course, but very off balance: basically, you get a chuck of mean with no side (garniture), for some 76 EUR. They could at least have thrown in a third leaf of spinach to the two they forgot on the plate. If you also go for the starters, please take out another 88 EUR for two small scallops (per person). The gentleman next to our table had to put his glasses on to find them on his plate... don't get me wrong, I do not mind paying for quality but this is ridiculous.

For desert, the 3D chocolate that my wife had looked like a nightmare from a spacial geometry class, and was so sweet she could not eat it. My desert, the 'millefeuille' was way too sweet and wound up giving me acid burn, so I wound up taking a pill to try and bet able to digest when I got home. And by the way, the breadcrumbs that were on the desert plate brought pompously to my table by the waiter, and then wiped off in hurry by the waiter...

This place would have potential, if they had any sense of getting the portions and proportions right, but they have no idea. Honestly, go to Le Pret Catalan in Paris or Le Oiseau Blanc, you will pay less, have a hugely better meal, and won't have to drive 4 hours to the middle of nowhere and back again.","1","","COUPLES","2017-12-31","2017-12-09","2017-12-09","en","La Cote Saint Jacques","1440197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r546288365-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html"

The Zander - a delicate river fish - had too much sauce and ""bready"" elements in both sauce and as additions. The snail dish was very nice although presentation could have been more refined. The flavours in the lamb were wrong and overpowering.

From the moment we arrived the service and food was of the highest quality and continued throughout or meal. Our party of six all enjoyed every dish with suitable wines to compliment them. The staff are a bit formal as expected but soon mellowed with our relaxed and jovial enjoyment of a lunch with great food and company. A wonderful start to a canal barge holiday. Thank you and highly recommended.","0","","COUPLES","2017-07-31","2017-08-09","2017-08-09","en","La Cote Saint Jacques","1440197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r510613347-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html"

There was also a buffet bar where we could help ourselves to croissants, bread, cheese and fruit. Soft drinks, fresh juices, water and beverages were included. To finish with,  we were served three very tasty small desserts. All the dishes were full of flavour. I particularly enjoyed the eggs meurette, the mackerel, the muscles in foam and the pasta with citrus fruits. We'll definitely be visiting CSJ again on our next trip to Joigny","0","","FAMILY","2017-07-31","2017-08-04","2017-08-04","en","La Cote Saint Jacques","1440197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r508800554-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html"

We had a lovely table with a marvelous view on the river. The food, as it is to be expected, was very good, and some dishes were excelent. The service was friendly and professional and not too stiff - which we liked. The wine list is exceptional and the lady somellier was friendly and helpfull. My only complaint - prices are rather high, even for this class of restaurants, especially if you choose to dine a-la-carte.","0","","COUPLES","2017-07-31","2017-07-22","2017-07-22","en","La Cote Saint Jacques","1440197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r504420257-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html"

We had the full menu, and all dishes were perfectly made, though i cannot recall one that stood out (i go to many such restaurants).

The desserts were especially interesting. i am attaching pictures.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/d7/ba/b7/lamb.jpg

It was even better than the last visit as we were able to sample the spring/summer menu. Service was outstanding, attentive but not hovering. The dining room is quiet yet not stuffy. We asked the som to suggest a wine given our description of preference in a white wine. He suggested a modest chablis (60 euro) rather than a super pricey selection. It was spot on for our taste. Multiple choices for the fixed price menu, plus an excellent a la carte listing offered variety and quality as well. Be sure to order the oyster ""pate"" that appears to have been made with whole, raw (uncooked) oysters. Excellent.  The dinner will put a dent in your wallet, but you will remember the food and not necessarily the cost.

This came 3rd as one would expect but we only had the set lunch at €78 which was excellent value, and was still a hugely enjoyable and fabulous meal.

Fantastic location with lovley views over the Yonne.
Food very good across the board.

Excellent wine list with some real value when looking for finer growers, such as the wines we had from Ramonet and Angerville.

Lovely coffee on the terace afterwards. Good part not whole collection of Michelin guides to Peruse.

If you havent been, go !","0","","FAMILY","2017-04-30","2017-04-30","2017-04-30","en","La Cote Saint Jacques","1440197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r480237539-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html"
