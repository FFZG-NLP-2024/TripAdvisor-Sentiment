Atmosphere: 5","The Best","OMG yes! If my only dish I could eat for the rest of my life was the Oysters & Pearls, I'd be in heaven. What you don't expect about The French Laundry is how approachable not only the menu is, but how unpretentious the space and the atmosphere is - the music is all upbeat and contemporary. The staff is, as you would expect, super friendly. And the food - well it's what you've come for and what you won't be disappointed with no matter how much you've built the experience up in your head. I enjoyed every bite - even the one bite of lobster I had before giving the rest to my wife, because I really don't eat seafood. But by all means, make sure you get the Oysters & Pearls, you might be tempted with the supplement, but you'd be making one of the biggest mistakes of your life. Also, be prepared that the upfront cost is really just a down-payment - once you get done with the wine, you can easily double the cost of the meal. But it's worth it - because how often are you coming back?","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/c7/a7/d1/caption.jpg

Our expectations were so high and we worried we would leave with some disappointments (as we have done with a few other of the world’s bests), but nothing disappointed.  The staff was amazing – attentive, congratulatory doing several things to recognize our anniversary, engaging, and proud of what they were serving.  The food did not disappoint either.  So many top restaurants stretch with gastronomic “art”, but TFL is just incredibly well done fine dining.  Each course was amazing but really enjoyed the mainstay Oysters and Pearls (it stays on the menu for a serious reason), lobster, truffle mac and cheese (most tasty supplement), and Elysian Fields lamb.  Even the salmon cone amuse was great and the perfect start.  And the whole complement of desserts did not disappoint.  Unlike many fixed menu restaurants, they do not have a fixed set of wine pairings, but our sommelier worked with us on about five half bottle selections to pair perfectly.  It’s a one-in-a-lifetime bucket list meal that we definitely want to find the next special occasion to go again.  Get the kitchen tour too – unbelievable!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/ef/44/4e/caption.jpg

I honestly forgot to do a review and we’re planning another trip to Napa for September. When someone asked me if we were going back to French Laundry and my automatic response was “no”, I thought maybe I should do a review.

We know a fair number of people who have been to TFL and loved it, so honestly, maybe we just were there on an off night. Firstly, our server was a woman with dark hair (can’t remember her name), and she was just kind of cold and unfriendly. My two biggest complaints are 1. They seemed like they were rushing us the entire time. To the point where they had brought out half the courses in less than an hour. I actually had to ask them to slow down, which they did, but it felt like we were an inconvenience. Kind of strange and disappointing- you go there expecting to spending close to 3 hours, and I think we were out in 2. And it would have been less if I wouldn’t have asked them to slow down.

2. The second issue was that several of the courses were lukewarm, at best. For what you’re paying, that’s pretty unacceptable. Normally, we would have said something but the server was so unfriendly, and we’d already asked them to slow the service down, so it just didn’t feel worth it.

Some of the courses were quite good, and the wine list is amazing. We also loved that the have you a peek in the kitchen at the end.

Again, it might been an off night. Maybe the woman that was serving us for a good portion of the meal had a bad day or whatever, but between that and the fact that several courses were cold, we probably won’t be back.","0","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2024-07-22","2024-07-22","en","The French Laundry","493634","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r960713938-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html"

But, we returned this May for our UC Berkeley student's college graduation dinner, and I love every bit of it, as did my three dining companions. Yes, it's expensive, maybe even over priced.  But the service is AMAZING...each course was AMAZING, and when our college graduate reflects back on this experience, I think it will be a cherished memory.

We were greeted by a very friendly waitress and given some background about the restaurant.  Did have to wait about 30 to 45 minutes beyond the time of our reservation to actually be seated but then settled back for a unique dining experience.  There was a lot of different foods to sample from poultry to seafood to meat dishes.  All of them were well prepared, but honestly some were better than others.  The buttered lobster was a personal favorite.  As the evening was winding down, overwhelmed by an onslaught of various desserts.  This is probably the type of place you actually visit once for the experience but it was an enjoyable evening.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-09","2024-03-09","en","The French Laundry","493634","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r941567530-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html"

The food was good, but not exceptional. The staff was super attentive and the space was nice, but in the end it is about the food. I had a piece of lamb that was quite difficult to cut, and tough. The desserts all came out rapid fire. Everything “looked” great, but once again it came down to the flavor, which was for a quarter of the dishes, not there. Hated to give this place 3 stars. Went to KOMI in D.C. years back that blew this out of the water! Turned to my friend who said the same thing when leaving.","1","","FRIENDS","2024-03-31","2024-03-05","2024-03-05","en","The French Laundry","493634","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r940901595-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html"

We did the chef's menu, gave the sommelier a wine budget for us, and allowed them to choose our wines. The food was amazing. The wine was terrific, but the service and attention to detail were most impressive. Perfect, but not staidly formal. The playlist was great. I am sincerely looking forward to another visit, perhaps in the summer months, so we can enjoy the gardens.","1","","COUPLES","2023-11-30","2024-02-05","2024-02-04","en","The French Laundry","493634","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33300-d493634-r936903716-The_French_Laundry-Yountville_Napa_Valley_California.html"

I had been looking forward to a 3* Michelin experience, but while the food was (mainly) good, it was not exceptional. I believe Michelin are threatening their own reputation as the leading guide for fine dining if they allow French Laundry to retain their current rating.
The Sommelier was most interested in how much he could extract from the group (when the first question is what is your budget it should have been a clue) rather than trying to ensure the best match of wine to the various dishes.
I found the Cobia delightful and the Duck excellent, but the rib of lamb was not tender. The desserts were also good, but too many.
The overwhelming experience was one of a restaurant that was living on its reputation and had become complacent. The manner of the staff was a little pompous and yet there are much better 1* establishments around and nothing could ever justify the price this place charges.

It looked like sludge (see picture attached) and tasted worse.  The cheese course was also bad.  My dinner companions who had the regular tasting were equally disappointed.  The lamb was tough.  The fish was also bad.  The wine pairings were very average and astronomically expensive.  None of the wines were particularly good.  Some were not yet ready to drink and most did not complement the food.  It was obvious the sole objective of the sommelier was to increase the wine tab.  All of the other 4 restaurants we ate at in Yountville were significantly better and were 1/4 of the price.  I am shocked this place has 3 stars.  The only thing that agrees with that assessment is the price.  ","5","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/de/38/94/caption.jpg
