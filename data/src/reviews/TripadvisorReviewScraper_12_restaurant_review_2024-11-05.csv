Staff is friendly. The food was great and the menu was well planned around local ingredients. What was little annoying that staff did not communicate with each other. For example, when we ordered drinks and I asked my aperitiv and wine same time. My wine came after a second course or the wine pairing drink came AFTER the food. Not so professional. Or if we ordered more drinks, after somewhile someone came to ask do we want something to drink. We had to explain these kind of issues over 6 times, ""we already ordered"". 
We asked a bill and after 15minutes someone came to ask do we want something more? Very frustrating when we had to explain many times ourselves. Not a relaxing way to have a dinner. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/fa/28/b0/caption.jpg

Also there was said that there is some puree with the fish, but was there any? Tempura was not crispy, it was soft and doughy, and missing salt or taste over all. The egg butter dish could have had also more salt, as well as the ""left overs dish"" from the fish. In Michelin star restaurant You should be happy without questions after dinner. So now not totally ""fine"" dining.","0","","FAMILY","2023-10-31","2023-10-21","2023-10-21","en","Vår","23612770","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315777-d23612770-r922341484-Var-Porvoo_Uusimaa.html"

The restaurant is small, it resides in the old part of Porvoo, and the interior is very well designed. Staff is friendly and so is the atmosphere. This was our second visit and we will come back soon.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/77/e2/96/caption.jpg

It is a small boutique restaurant decorated in a modern Nordic style. Polite service, unfortunately spoke in a very low voice in English with a Finnish accent and it was therefore difficult to get the full description. The dishes and accompanying wines were well put together, Can definitely be recommended.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/26/b3/05/f3/just-one-of-the-many.jpg

It was a few weeks ago, and they wrote that otherwise good menu, there was too much salt everywhere.
And yes, I can confirm that there is salt (I would rename the menu as 'Salt in different dishes'). I am not a low-salt a person, so, if it is way too much for me, how is it for low-salt persons?
I cannot appreciate chefs who does not read reviews or do not care, so, I recommend not to go there unless you like way oversalted food. A waist of your time and money.","0","","NONE","2021-10-31","2021-10-21","2021-10-21","en","Vår","23612770","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315777-d23612770-r815415636-Var-Porvoo_Uusimaa.html"

The staff seems enthusiastic and staff is needed for this level of food. The price is high, but this is not an everyday lunch place.
Miljöö was the only one who took the star. The music was really strange and unnecessarily loud. There was one toilet, it somehow feels like it's not soundproofed, it's scary that intimate sounds belong in the dining room...","0","","FAMILY","2024-01-31","2024-01-14","2024-01-14","en","Vår","23612770","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g315777-d23612770-r934009165-Var-Porvoo_Uusimaa.html"
