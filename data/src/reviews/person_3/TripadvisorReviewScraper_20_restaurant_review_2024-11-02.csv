Food: 5","Best oysters in Valle de Guadalupe","This place is GREAT - best oysters and raw fish in all of Valle de Guadalupe. Fantastic customer service!  We go every time we are in the area and will continue to visit each time.  Only downside the last 2 visits was (several) piles of dog poop on the way to the bathrooms.  Hard to go back to happily eating raw fish after you see that.  Otherwise, this place is perfection.

We lucked out with a warm, sunny day which made it even more perfect.

The seafood was so fresh and beautifully cared for. Fresh, clean flavors that enhanced vs distracted from the high quality ingredients. Both raw and grilled oysters were amazing and the oyster tacos were out of this world! The only course we didn't love was the uni, which is typically one of my very favorite foods. Sadly this was the one item I felt was overworked, with the tomatoes outshining and overpowering the uni. That said, would go back in a heartbeat. In fact, we would have gone again the next day if they'd been open.

We also had some of their sparkling wine from the winery on premise, which was a perfect pairing.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/28/57/e3/2e/caption.jpg

Funny enough, after we ate here we looked up online 'how many oysters can a human eat before it becomes dangerous'. THAT is how good this place is.

Food: 3","AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY-RESTROOM SITUATION- AFRAID OF THE DARK OR BIG DOGS?","The bubbly and the food are right on spot! However, I am giving only 3 stars to this place because with the prestige that they hold, one would've think they have the resources to spent in proper lighting for the guests to be able to go to the restroom safely. If you have a problem walking in the dark and feel unsafe about it, either do not visit this place in the winter months when sun goes down early in the afternoon or just avoid going to the restroom while you are there or just go during the day. I dared to go to the restroom by myself in the absolute dark, when I saw how dark it really was I came back and asked the waiter if they had any sensor lighting or if they could turn on some lights back there, he just said ""no we don't sorry"" so I proceeded to go back to my table and pick up my phone to help myself look after my steps using the phone's flashlight...Once I got to the restroom which is fairly far from the tables behind another part of the construction beside, there was a man inside the restroom next to me and I felt completely unsafe in that atmosphere...since it was so dark outside. Once I was trying to return with the same operation of turning my iphone lantern on, I started stepping in the gravel in the dark and that must have tipped off the dogs they have because I was surprised with the huge german shepherd they have unleashed on the property barking at me right beside me, which was very frightening considering the whole scene. ...Not a great end to the whole visit. Uncomfortable.","0","","NONE","2022-02-28","2022-02-21","2022-02-21","en","Conchas de Piedra","11746469","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499403-d11746469-r828812533-Conchas_de_Piedra-Valle_de_Guadalupe_Ensenada_Municipality_Baja_California.html"

Service was fast and friendly. 
Be aware they only serve sparkling wine. The rose was very good. Red wine could be purchased at the bodega next door. 

The setting is very nice  however during  lunch time in July 2019 the place needs more  shade. Seating is bar style with very uncomfortable rustic stools. Not conductive to linger and enjoy your meal.

Having  some normal tables and chairs would make the  whole experience perfect!

We stayed in wonderful Villa del Valle B&B, on top of a hill with excellent views.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d1/43/15/conchas-de-piedra-valle.jpg
