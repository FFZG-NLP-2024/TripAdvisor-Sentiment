6 course menu which is tailored and as a vegetarian I have never been treated as well in a fancy restaurant.
They had to create a course for me because they had planned a celery ravioli with wakame and I’m allergic to seaweed …
It was green asparagus - one of my great favourite vegetables! 
Everything was beautiful from the truffle potato mash mise en bouche to the mushroom gnocchi, the leaks in a mustard seed mousseline with some citrus (yuzu?) to the two asparagus feasts, an incredible mingling of some lemony light coulis and on the other side some kind of tawny marmalade gravy. 
The cheese course was also light and fantastic : a fromage frais quenelle (mini) 
As was the pudding with a secret “orange sanguine” sorbet touch at the core.
Also loved the mignardises- amazing pate de fruit (not sweet) and chocolate with a ganache and of course, the two bouchées d’accueil- one with caramelized onion and the other puffed rice as a base for a creamy dollop with an Iranian spice. 
Everything is delicate, and yet extremely tasty and you can discriminate each main ingredient, nothing is drowned nor forgotten but underlined or highlighted depending on the intention. 
It is a variation on the range of acidity and the textures that envelop it. 
Even the zataar bread was to die for. (As was the pain de campagne) 
Very creative, an enchanted journey in a lofty atmosphere neither dark nor bright. 
A wonderful gift for the eyes and … especially the taste buds","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/b3/df/a4/caption.jpg

Food: 3","Some serious flaws","Based on a friend’s recommendation we were really looking forward to this meal. We got the 5 course with wine tasting. A few of the dishes were good, some like the snails with a spinach sauce not to our taste at all. But there were 2 major problems 

1 where’s the protein?  At the end of the meal I lifted my spoon and said to my wife, do you realize we ate every dish with a spoon.  No fork or knife needed for what was served and nothing other than the small bits of snail, which have no taste on there own. There was absolutely no substance to the meal and at this price you expect more. I think they know that as the bread kept coming so we weren’t hungry when we left.

The wine pours were tiny, really 1 or 2 small sips. Smallest I’ve had on a tasting menu.  Not enough to really enjoy and certainly not enough to get a sense of with the food which is the point

Clearly disappointed","1","","NONE","2022-09-30","2022-10-20","2022-10-20","en","Anona","17448877","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r865270922-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Food: 3","Creative but….","I admired the creativity of the meal, the freshness and delicacy as well. However, we ate the five course meal and had to eat several bread rolls to feel full. I am not a big eater either. The meal was light to a fault, with almost no protein. The wine pairings were not particularly interesting and were such small pours we couldn’t really even enjoy the wines deeply enough as they were gone in 3 or 4 sips.  Since they do change the menu regularly, other diners might have a completely different experience. We definitely saw the effort and thought that went into each dish. We enjoyed four of the five courses, and found the snail dish not good due to the very bitter and tough herbs used to make the sauce.  The creative cheese course was perhaps my favorite course of the night.  My husband would give us a much lower than a four score but I really did appreciate the effort put into the dishes but….","0","","NONE","2022-10-31","2022-10-08","2022-10-08","en","Anona","17448877","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r863713383-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Food: 3","Better attention would have elevated the experience","The reason I wanted to eat here was because they have a focus on sustainability and I really wanted to learn more about how they implement that, to how they select their ingredients and where they source them from etc, and we were told that it would be explained to us later, but it never happened? I think it’s especially important for a fine dine restaurant to be elaborate on this part, so I found that incredibly disappointing first of all.
The service from the waiter was very smooth, and I do appreciate that. However whenever dishes were served to us I felt like it was so rushed in a way. The chef himself would describe it at a very swift pace as if he's in a rush and then he'd leave in a blink of an eye. I found that a pity because it felt a bit careless in that aspect.
Another thing that's a minus was when I explicitly said I'm allergic to cherries, they ended up serving me a dish with cherries in it anyway by mistake. They did kindly replace that with another dish with green beans and lemon jelly though and that was really good. But I still find it a bit messy on their part.
The dishes themselves were good, but I wouldn't say they were super innovative. There was also an escargot dish that I didn't quite like, but I think escargot just isn't my thing. I had some feedback on the sauce that was accompanied with it and the chef listened but then brushed it off, I didn't really feel like it was appreciated.
I did thoroughly enjoy the rest of the courses though, especially the 3rd, 4th (the green bean lemon jelly one) and the first dessert. Those were my favs!
I still think it's a good restaurant, but I feel like the personal attention part is lacking, as I explained earlier. I hope this will be seen and be taken into consideration for the future!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/64/a2/90/1st-course.jpg

Food: 5","Lovely dinner","I took a very good friend of mine last week for dinner for her birthday (Aug. 12). For dinner is only  a discovery menu in 5 courses for €75 (€120 including wine pairing), and a tasting menu in 7 courses for €95 (€155 including wine pairing). For lunch you have ""à la carte"". We opted for the 7 courses without wine pairing. It was indeed a lovely discovery. Thibaut Spiwack is the Chef and his philosophy is: local and seasonal products, waste reduction, minimal use of water and electricity, We started with a wonderful combination of tomatoes followed by an excellent mixt of Normandy beef and Southwestern duck with red fruit pickles. Then we had  amazing snails from Poitou, with its cream of herbs... it was so light! They served us after  tuna from the Bay of Biscay, marinated and grilled tataki style with Paimpol coco beans. The highlight then was the cheese with a foam and some red fruits. The first desert was a wonderful peach tart with a delicious sorbet of peaches of the grapevine. We also had a second dessert with caramel, peanuts (not really my favorite one). We loved the decoration and the blue colors of the dining room. Service is attentive and professional.  We loved the cuisine of Thibaut Spiwack. There is always a good twist of acidity which really makes the dishes very interesting.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a2/d5/f5/the-mignardises.jpg

We opted for the 5-course menu and it was filling but because the portion size was quite small it suited us.

All courses were interesting (not exotic), creative and well presented. A bit surprising was that 2 of the 5 courses were desserts. I guess the chef had more dessert ideas that day. But we were happy with that.

A dessert, fresh fruit tart on white cheese basil and chilli, without interest

Cooking: it’s already winter!
Dishes without generosity, using products found on the January stalls (it is nevertheless the full season of mushrooms, figs, grapes,...): leeks, potatoes, onions, corn, pig, place... nothing extravagant except a careful presentation (even if you must recognize a certain inventiveness to cook such products!)
A dinner that ends with an unimaginative tzatziki: cucumber and Greek yogurt.
And finally, never seen in a starry: you have to pay 20€ more because you don’t eat pigs!
One emerges from Anona with the unpleasant Impression that for Thibaut Spiwack the turnover and margin matter more than the pleasure of the customer (addition to 3: 570€).
I do not recommend!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-22","2024-10-22","en","Anona","17448877","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r974950245-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

The environment is pleasant and the service great, friendly, efficient. What really lacked was quality in the kitchen, or rather, taste!!! The appearance of the dishes is great, but definitely did not make my type of taste. Of the six tried dishes, amuse bouche plus 5 of the menu tasting, only one was very good, one good and the rest reasonable. Very good wine options in glass. The bill of more than 400 euros for a couple was excessive.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/a1/42/cb/caption.jpg
