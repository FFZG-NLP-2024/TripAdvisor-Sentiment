Their booking system is suspect. I booked a table for 2 people on July 14, 2023 at 8 PM, and paid the 400 Euro deposit - instead, the confirmation came back and said my table was booked for two people at Noon on July 14, which there was no way I could make, because I was just getting into Paris around Noon that day. I tried to call the restaurant repeatedly to correct this, but no one would ever answer the phone. I emailed, and they told me they were booked the evening of July 14 and could not accommodate me that night - which happens to be the only night I will be in Paris. They have refused to refund my deposit, despite the error on the part of their booking system. They were very smug and snarky in their written communications with me, simply pointing to their no-refund policy for the deposits. Again, I repeatedly explained to them that the booking error was on their part, not mine, yet they refused to refund my deposit.","7","","FRIENDS","2023-07-31","2023-07-08","2023-07-08","en","Table by Bruno Verjus","26262850","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d26262850-r901471408-Table_by_Bruno_Verjus-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
