Service: 1
Food: 1","Shockingly bad","We were hugely disappointed with our experience here. 

The restaurant is on a busy street with no signs for parking and no direct signage where to enter.

When we entered the restaurant there was loud banging from the open kitchen. Chef Anthony was banging something in a large pan then several of the other staff took their turns. The waiters were all dressed in chef whites while Chef Anthony wore a t-shirt and baseball cap.

The restaurant was not busy. The waiters were nervously busy, walking back and forth. It was very distracting. After Chef Anthony left they seemed to calm down without their nervous energy. 

I ordered the vegan menu. My husband ordered a non-vegan menu. 

The waitstaff was cordial however we waited a good 15 minutes before being asked if we would like an apéritif. We were served an amuse bouche. Mine was some sort of plant-based sushi. The rice was like concrete and it looked like a child made it. Not a good first impression of the food. Up to that point the wine menu had not been presented and my husband asked to see it. 

My husband ordered wine and the bottle delivered did not match the description on the menu. We signaled to one of the waiters and he apologized, agreeing with my husband that the wine served was incorrect. The bartender (sommelier??) came immediately and loudly berated my husband for being wrong. Thank goodness for the Vivino wine app because my husband was able to show the bartender the wine label that should have corresponded with the wine menu. The bartender still argued, so loudly that the diners beside us stopped eating to see what was going on. My husband is very patient and quiet - he did not argue but let the incident go. Afterwards the bartender came again, making his point once more about the wine served was indeed the wine on the menu but the only label was incorrect. If a wine menu states that it is a certain wine, then that is what should be served, not an arbitrary one. Nor should the customer be loudly berated for the restaurant’s error. The wine incident was very stressful.

The food was not delicious. Some of the plates looked very nice but they lacked any flavor and seasoning. Hardly what’s expected in a Michelin star restaurant.

Since my seat was facing the kitchen I had a bird’s eye view of all the busyness. I saw a small styrofoam box on the floor. I didn’t give it a second thought until shortly after. The waiter put that same styrofoam box directly on our table (after being on the floor) to prepare a dry ice sorbet. I was shocked it went from the floor to our table. The sorbet had a showy presentation but had zero flavor. 

My main course was some sort of architectural stack that fell over when the waiter put it in front of me. He tried to correct it with his long tweezers but was unsuccessful. He then used his bare fingers to correct the presentation. It should have immediately been taken back to the kitchen. This is the same waiter that plunked the styrofoam box from floor to table. That’s when we decided to leave. 

We did not finish the rest of the courses because the experience had been such a disaster. The waiters looked visibly shocked and gathered to have “meeting” about our bill.  They reduced my husband’s portion while charging me the full price. They also did not charge us for the wine problem and neither did they apologize. 

Before we paid, I went to the ladies room. The door handle to the stall came off and I couldn’t get out. The bathrooms have dark walls and low lighting and I could not see to reattach the handle. My phone was at the table so calling was not an option. After 15 minutes was able to wiggle the mechanism to open the door. Since the handle would not reattach, I took it to one of the waiters and he never blinked an eye for the inconvenience. I’m not making this up - the photo is below. 

We will never go back to the restaurant. Even if it was inexpensive (which it wasn’t), in addition to all the faux pas, the food had no flavor and the service was not on par to any Michelin restaurants we have visited.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/9e/54/08/two-teaspoons-of-food.jpg

Food: 5","Very Interesting Place","I come to this area about 4 times a year. This was my first time at Antony's. 
The first impression: There is no parking dedicated to the restaurant. You can park at a physician practice next to the restaurant but it is not obvious. The interior is a little dark but very modern.
The Service: Very friendly and knowable.The sommelier is very good and their wine list is good.
The food: The food is outstanding and very innovative. Their menu is limited and they want to sell their fixed price menu. We ate ""alla carte"". As an appetizer we had an open ravioli. This was awesome. It had a healthy portion of lobster inside. The ravioli was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a very light champagne foamy sauce. It was just great. We both had a USDA prime fillet stak with a port wine reduction sauce. Fantastic vegetables and some nice potato parfait rounded the dish of. A very nice chocolate and yogurt ice cream desert rounded the meal of. They have one Michelin star and it shows. We enjoyed the food and the ambiance. We will be back.","1","","COUPLES","2018-03-31","2018-03-29","2018-03-29","en","Anthony´s Kitchen","8065598","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g230063-d8065598-r569542330-Anthony_s_Kitchen-Meerbusch_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"

First of all we complimented Anthony on his first and new awarded Michelin Star.

He had available for us a salmon ~4-5 kg plus 2 x beef filets vacuum sealed from the US.
First of all we learned to judge the quality of meat as well as the quality of a fish. His communication was easy going and combined with lots of laughter from us and himself. The whole atmosphere was gorgeous. Next to the fact that we all learned a lot about cooking in general and especially about our self prepared dinner we had so much fun.
Anthony is an intelligent, charming and very knowledgeable person who can transmit the difficulties of cooking in a super easy way.
The food: We were breathless when staring to eat our self made dinner. Anthony even joined us for the main course and explained about the spices he used and why sometimes funny combination taste great.
The served Champagne, the vines red and white ware great and bottomline we all had a fantastic evening. 
Next time we will join Anthony's kitchen to eat without working ;-)","1","","FRIENDS","2017-11-30","2017-11-19","2017-11-19","en","Anthony´s Kitchen","8065598","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g230063-d8065598-r542004311-Anthony_s_Kitchen-Meerbusch_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"

Each dish was a true work of art – perfected in taste and presentation. Anthony and his team keep managing to go up a notch.

The subtle redesign of the restaurant has been extremely successful – even more elegant and stylish. Especially the new round tables open up completely new possibilities for how to sit and communicate with each other. They not only promote togetherness, but also exchange, which is particularly important in many cultures, such as West Africa, where people traditionally eat in circles. Anthony has shown an impressive touch here.

The West African-inspired star cuisine is in a nutshell! Even diehard gourmets can look forward to a whole new taste experience. The team is absolutely attentive and courteous – the chefs responsible for the respective courses come personally to the table to answer any question, no matter how small.

The in-house shuttle service picked us up with a glass of champagne and brought us safely back home after a fantastic wine accompaniment.

This is star cuisine according to the rules of art!

Keep it up – I wish you the second star with all my heart!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-29","2024-09-28","en","Anthony´s Kitchen","8065598","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g230063-d8065598-r971797879-Anthony_s_Kitchen-Meerbusch_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"
