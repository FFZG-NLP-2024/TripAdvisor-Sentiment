However, even though the food, which is vegetarian, tastes magnificent, the restaurant is extremely expensive for what it is offering. If not for the bread, you can end up hungry after paying the amount you'd pay at a high-end steakhouse. Same for the wines; nice pairing but not great. That's why I gave it 3/5 and not higher. For a 2 Michelin star restaurant I was expecting something different.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-19","2024-10-18","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r974480015-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

    Prioritizes flavor above all else
    Masterful use of textures
    Expertly transforms ingredients
    Innovative, if not avant-garde
    Conceptual
    Possesses a distinctive, immediately recognizable style

These qualities make him the best chef I know. In my opinion, his cuisine surpasses that of many winners of the ""50 Best"" list, including The Fat Duck, Noma, El Celler de Can Roca, Osteria Francescana, Eleven Madison Park, Geranium, and Disfrutar.

The staff, from the restaurant manager to the waiters, perfectly embody ""Berlin coolness"" with a high degree of professionalism.

Given these attributes, I can't understand why he hasn't yet been awarded a third star.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/d9/54/68/caption.jpg

I’m with those who say “wow.”  I found each dish to be delicous. I enjoyed finding out what can be done with familiar ingredients, prepared and combined in unfamiliar ways.

I was lucky enough to dine there on a beautiful evening, when dinner was served outside.  All of the servers — including the chef himself — were friendly, efficient, and full of information about the meal and wines.  The whole evening was a delight.

If you are just looking for a good traditional meal to fill up on, this is not the place for you. But if you are up for a culinary adventure, give it a try.  You may enjoy it as much as I did.","0","","SOLO","2024-06-30","2024-06-02","2024-06-02","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r953383961-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

Then we come to Hováth. 

Staff super-friendly, cozy-sophisticated ambiente. And yes, the cuisine was sophisticated too, even creative. 

But consuming it was decidedly less enjoyable than paying a French speeding ticket, a year late, with triple fines, like we did this morning. 

Twice as expensive though. 

And with about the same relevance to actual Austrian or European food. 

Two Michelin stars, five Gault Millau hats. Using those too as a door stop from now on. ","1","","COUPLES","2023-11-30","2023-11-01","2023-11-01","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r924013786-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

As a result, we felt something was missing. Nothing was bad, a lot of dishes tasted great (ice cream from apricot seeds and the mushroom ""foie gras""). It would be great if the menu had at least the option of one or two fish or meat dishes...for the more conventionally mind guests.","0","","NONE","2022-12-31","2022-12-25","2022-12-25","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r872745332-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

Food: 2","Disappointing to the core","The beauty of deception, pretending to be something that you’re not, lies in the element of surprise. The villain turns out to be the hero, the enemy to be a friend, and the fish to be a mushroom. Horváth jumps into the deep ocean waters of pretending, pushing the notions of what is and what is not from your eye, through your nose, and into your mouth. 

A game of deception is as old and basic as we are. It goes back to childhood memories of Hide & Seek, Halloween parties filled with dress-ups, and your mum telling you it’s just an incessant piece of chuckled when it’s actually medicine. When we set down and had the first two dishes, everything was exactly where it should have been, with no deception. The wine was carefully chosen, the oyster mushroom false liver (foie gras) was spectacular, and the bread was simply on point. What can go wrong from here? 

Do you know this art exhibition that doesn’t make sense no matter how many philosophical abstractions you make? That one friend that keeps arguing and arguing and takes it a bit too far to the point of incoherency? That techno track that should have just ended on minute 7:37? That’s your food experience at Horvath. A culinary attempt that fails on its own premises. You see, when things pretend to be something else, when food and dishes try to musk themselves and create a whole new experience, there are two options: they are either exceptionally interesting and mind-blowing or fall under their own weight into a bland, unsatisfactory mash of mushrooms. 

No matter how many abstractions we will make, how post-modern we may be, a cucumber can not be a Sirloin, and a carrot is just a carrot. 

In the end, Horváth fails. The food leaves you empty, unsatisfied, and mainly wondering what if: what if the chef tried to make actual food, and not abstractions of food concepts?

A word must be written about the Chocolate Sorbet 'Hunter Style': I've never had such a catastrophic dessert in a fine dining restaurant. Never.","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/26/66/66/8c/2.jpg

We have visited many times over several years before Corona and this was our first visit after the pandemic restrictions have been lifted. The restaurant has been recently renovated removing some of the cozy atmosphere in favour of a more international look. Unfortunately this also has affected the acoustics so it can be quite noisy. The service is very good and friendly, However, this time the food did not resonate with us. The first amuse was lukewarm milk with butter - not good. This also goes for the desert of roasted carrots with caramelised fish broth. In between five very small dishes heavily depending on vegetables where added sauces stood for tastes and were quite similar trending towards no or sour tastes. Visually pleasing but not outstanding. Sadly not good value for money.","1","","COUPLES","2021-09-30","2021-10-01","2021-09-30","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r812545761-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

Yes because it is fine dining at its best","0","","COUPLES","2019-11-30","2019-11-11","2019-11-11","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r725721767-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

The wines were also interesting but nothing to write home about. The juices were a clever and appealing offer for the non alcohol drinkers. The service was competent and the ambiance relaxed. The sad thing is that one left the restaurant, without really remembering which of the courses was worth remembering!","1","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-11-06","2019-11-06","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r724556038-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

And then something started that only exists in Berlin: highest enjoyment with absolute ease and nonchalance. No star fuss, no expensive cloche, no gourmet bells and whistles. A restaurant like a cozy Berlin pub. Simply puer taste, unexpected flavors and a product kitchen at the highest level. Unpretentious, easy, without allure. Of course, that does not like everyone. But we just liked it. The food is above reproach. At the center is the vegetable kitchen. But the piglet was a greeting from paradise. And the smoked trout was good for kneeling. A service that is always cheerful, attentive and unobtrusive. The evening was a dream. We rarely ate better in 2019. And we saw some starred places.","2","","NONE","2019-10-31","2019-10-07","2019-10-07","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r715964782-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

The decor includes a pretty wooden bar near the entry, and polished wooden tables.  The service was impeccably professional yet friendly. We enjoyed the elegance of  receiving the small cards with descriptions of each course, and how each course's silverware was presented in a box by staff with gloved hands. The food was wonderful, with unique combinations and unusual ingredients.Each course brought special flavors and presentations.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/19/2f/0d/42/bread-service-sourdough.jpg

While the food itself is rather interesting (it’s a blend of typical German/Austrian/ Hungarian cuisine served the french way), it didn’t strike us as particularly well presented, tasty or well matched. The wines were all from the same regions as the food; they might have been good vines for where they come from, but neither of the countries are wine powerhouses. The worst thing was the decoration (german style rugged down minimalistic nothingness) and lackluster service (uninspired and with no proper training). I have visited quite a few Michelin star restaurants. I only understood the rating when we got the bill.","3","","BUSINESS","2019-07-31","2019-07-19","2019-07-19","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r690969636-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

And then there’s all the extras “compliments of the kitchen”. We loved every morsel. 
Couldn’t fault the food
Or the attentive wait staff
Or the wine list and advice given. 
Some advice to the restaurant though. Please ask before a new bottle of mineral is poured, especially at the end of the meal. It carries a 9€ charge which is s waste if none is consumed.","4","","COUPLES","2019-07-31","2019-07-16","2019-07-16","en","Restaurant Horváth","1182072","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r690159542-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html"

Very informal but in a good way. Patio was lovely. Some items were fabulous (salmon with chocolate sauce) while others were just ok. Overall I cannot say I would recommend this place.  By the way water was 9 euros per person.

- setting, feels like a country style restaurant 
- food, with exception of the pre course (onion soup) dishes had odd flavors 
- drinks, limited selection of champagne and only by the bottle 
- service, cafe style no personal touch at all
