It was fairly pricey - 3 courses E47 per head - but well worth it.  The staff were charming and extremely courteous.

Unfortunately we cannot be as generous about our room.  This was situated in the Pavilion and was dated and clumsy in appearance.  The bathroom had mould around the shower area which needs addressing.  There were no toiletries (only a used shampoo and sewing kit!) or bottles of complementary water which tends to be standard in many hotels if this calibre.  

The Spa!  This was super and we made use of it twice being able to book it out privately for E15 per head.  Such a treat!","0","","COUPLES","2022-09-30","2022-09-10","2022-09-10","en","Chateau de Beaulieu","2092708","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g207342-d2092708-r859422904-Chateau_de_Beaulieu-Joue_les_Tours_Tours_Indre_et_Loire_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

Food: 2","Was staying here, but you must like Foie Gras if dinner is included!","Stunning looking building. lovely room, and our dinner was included in our tour.  However, we were not asked if we had any choice, even if we wanted to pay for something else, in fact we were not given an menu.  Just given Foie Gras and a bun of some sort.  It was my husbands Birthday and I let them know ahead of time, but still no options.  I did ask for a cake and well, we got a lemon with a candle in it.  So, no, I would not recommend this place.  Especially if you are vegetarian or VEGAN!  Ack!  Which I am not, but I still would have liked to have something other than Foie Gras. 

Place is very quiet- I would suggest some light background music.

In the morning we had breakfast, limited selection, help yourself, and I noticed they didn't set any of the tables with a view of the grounds,  Just us 2 different couples in one corner, at the back of the room.  Not sure why?  The view is pretty!","0","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-10-16","2019-10-16","en","Chateau de Beaulieu","2092708","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g207342-d2092708-r718811290-Chateau_de_Beaulieu-Joue_les_Tours_Tours_Indre_et_Loire_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

In short the dinners were brilliant, the first evening with seefood and the other with meat on the menu. The meals were well made and nicely presented and the recommended local wines matched the food superbly. 

The service was a little bit formal, but still friendly and forthcoming. There was no problem when I the second evening wanted cheese (from a very rich offer) instead of the sweet desert.","0","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-09-13","2019-09-13","en","Chateau de Beaulieu","2092708","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g207342-d2092708-r709410590-Chateau_de_Beaulieu-Joue_les_Tours_Tours_Indre_et_Loire_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

Good service, helpful people. You can see this must have been a great place at a time, I guess in the '80's. Erosed plastic terrace furniture... The dining room spreads a touch grandeur, but once again, '80's-'90's, dated colors, carpets ...and this strange mix of beamed ceiling and plastered chimneys that shouldn't be mixed. In this case, the beams should be hidden behind decent plasterwork to fit with the rest of the athmosphere. Food was not up to what we expected. The egg in the starter was raw. The lobster sauce with the fish was not tasteful, too salty and too prominently present. However desert was magic! Succulent. This seems to be, without any doubt their strength. Drinks were very highly priced (10€ for a standard glass of white wine?) We feel what's offered is not up to the price you pay, the dinner as such being totally overrated. It needs a fresh wind to get in line with the standard they're aiming at.","1","","NONE","2018-07-31","2018-07-07","2018-07-06","en","Chateau de Beaulieu","2092708","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g207342-d2092708-r593686460-Chateau_de_Beaulieu-Joue_les_Tours_Tours_Indre_et_Loire_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

Initial impressions were really beautiful place, nicely restored and very friendly staff.  Grounds well maintained and very nice. Room was lovely if not a little tired however that's sometimes 'the look' in these places. Fine. Went to the restaurant and had really great service. Food however left a little to be desired. We went for three courses. My fish dish consisted of scallops - when they arrived they were underdone. I know there's a fine line with scallops but they were cold in areas and translucent. There was some kind of mush in the middle which didn't add anything to the dish at all. The lamb was a bit tough. Would have expected better from a French restaurant. However the 'dining experience' was a nice one in that the service was brilliant and tables set out nicely, room was well appointed.

Beautiful rooms, grounds and reception area, plus an excellent restaurant where we had a wonderful meal. Service was excellent, the staff very helpful and we felt pampered. The tie up with the Relais de Silence hotel is not prominent, but seems to have provided investment in good facilities without taking away the personal service you would expect from a family run hotel. Excellent all round.

Maybe Monday was the chef's night off but we were offered a set menu with no choices.  The foie gras was delicious but not difficult to do, the steak was very tough and not well cooked, the baked peach was delicious, but again the sort of dish which didn't need a huge amount of skill.  There was a great cheese trolley but we were not offered it, even as a supplement - maybe they have underpriced their half board and this was why.  It was certainly very quiet in the dining room with only a handful of hotel guests.","0","","COUPLES","2016-09-30","2016-10-01","2016-10-01","en","Chateau de Beaulieu","2092708","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g207342-d2092708-r424076929-Chateau_de_Beaulieu-Joue_les_Tours_Tours_Indre_et_Loire_Centre_Val_de_Loire.html"

   The evening's menu changes according to what the chef wishes to make. We had a lovely fish dish and an amazing dessert of chocolate macarons served with a butter hazelnut ice cream that I will go to my deathbed remembering. 
   Don't forget to pack a swim suit. Chateau Beaulieu has a spa where you can lounge in the hot tub for two hours as their guest. There are also a number of spa services that you can book ahead.
