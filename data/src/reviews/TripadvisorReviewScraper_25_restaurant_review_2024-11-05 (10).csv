Atmosphere: 5","The Michelin star is not fair; it deserves more","Very unique approach where all tables are served at the same time, where all comes from the local area, where the entrées is an abundance of dishes all executed to the millimeter and where the guests are invited to be active and find out what are they tasting.

The view to the kitchen shows that everything is being tested before is is sent out; this is a very impressive machinery and the amount of work produced in the kitchen is herculean.

Note on the bread, it is home-made too and in such a nice way that it has been years since eating such bread, and it will be years till the next one.

This is a moment suspended away from time in a very intimate room. The dinner takes easily 4 hours: we come here for taking time and taking things slow.
Due to the nature of the fact that all is prepared on the spot and the room is served entirely at the same time, there can be some moments that are a bit long.

It is worth noting that none of the tables ordered any alcohol; the cuisine is self sufficient and no pairing is required. Also, there are so many dishes that if you had to take a glass even on every other dish only, one wouldn’t be able to get full tasting capabilities by the end of it.

It is also a very unique approach that there is no vertical management, and it shows on how peaceful the team is. Each team member is handpicked to be sure they fit in this unique management style, and talking with them is already a travel by itself.

It is a success all throughout and it deserves more than 1 star; maybe 1.5 star. The washroom is maybe the only thing that is not fully on par with the rest of the establishment.

Booking in advance recommended, table near the windows and the cliff will mainly make sense for lunch.

Food - interesting and unusual taste combinations, some very tasty, but no “wow-moments “. Instead there were a few dishes I definitely disliked. The chef should perhaps focus on balancing/perfecting selected dishes, rather than producing a multitude of tastes. Far too much sour (and I mean REALLY sour) flavours for my taste. Also, two chicken main dishes in a set menu is not really ok. In general, except for the multitude of colourful starters, it felt quite cheap, especially for the prices they are charging. The strongest point for me was the extensive use of fresh herbs/flowers from their own garden in every dish. It did elevate the taste and overall experience.
Drinks - generally very good wines, well matched with the dishes. A very tasty and original aperitif of the house. Nice selection of digestives. For environmental reasons they use their own filtered tap water, which is ok (although the taste was not great). What is not ok is to charge for it as if it was an exclusive bottled water.
Service - very friendly and attentive, but lacking the smooth excellence you expect in a star restaurant. Three waitresses for the whole dining room (including the sommelier) is not really enough and the service was sometimes delayed, or not synchronised. Their English was also not really fluent. The explanation/presentation of dishes was much more limited than in other star restaurants.
Setting - except for the nice view, the place really lacks some style and refinement. The decor gives a cosy, but cheap impression. The napkins looked and felt like they were my grandma’s age and they were not even nicely ironed. You are expected to use the same cutlery for multiple dishes. The tables outside would fit better in a roadside cafe and the walk to the entrance makes you wonder if you’re entering someone’s (not very tidy) backyard. It is not even lit in the evening - don’t forget your flashlight!
To sum up - Aponem is a nice restaurant and definitely worth a visit if you are a foodie and don’t care much about prices. It is definitely overpriced for what is delivered and it definitely doesn’t live up to a Michelin star experience.
If you want a real star experience, drive around 15-20 minutes towards the coast and restaurant De Lauzun - that is a star restaurant!","1","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-08-15","2024-08-15","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r965037627-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"

The Michelin star is well-deserved. We recently went back and had another over-the-top amazing meal and evening at Aponem. This time we started with a cocktail that Gaby created based on a few ideas of things we like, and it was a sign of the many more good things to come from the Aponem team. The entire meal was incredible, from a dizzying spread of appetizers, to magical main courses, and desserts that were as delicious as they were beautiful. Dinner lasts for hours, and we enjoyed every moment.","0","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-21","2024-07-21","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r960570341-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"

Food very interesting, a bit too fussy , so many different flavors hide the beauty of the natural product. Too many, too long explanations about what we’re going to eat and patronizing, condescending staff and sommelier .

The food was typical of nouvelle cuisine - beautifully presented and full of subtle and delicious flavors. 
So NOTHING wrong with the food! 

But the co-owner barely left us alone. She treated us as if we had never been in a Michelin star restaurant before! Every dish was laboriously explained and often quite condescendingly. Such obsequious intrusion spoilt what should have been a very pleasurable experience. 

There is simply no place for pretentiousness of this sort in any restaurant.","6","","COUPLES","2020-01-31","2020-12-01","2020-12-01","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r778253582-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"

Our reservation was at 7:30pm, which was when the restaurant opened. As we were a few minutes early, the gate was closed. There wasn’t anywhere to sit whilst waiting and it was quite dark, something the restaurant might want to address. However when they opened the gate it was a warm welcome. The restaurant decor was understated, the tables unfussy and the lighting just right. It was clear we were there for the food and my goodness it certainly took centre stage. We found the food innovative, surprising, delicious and beautifully presented. The staff were attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and happily bilingual. A lot of the ingredients came from the restaurant’s own gardens which meant the food was very fresh and so flavourful. It was a wonderful evening and we can’t wait to return.

And what a beautiful location; clearly we are not alone in thinking it is more than worth the slight effort to get there.

Set menus - one standard one 'gourmet' - are both, in effect 'gourmet'. Wine is fairly priced, the sommelier is hugely knowledgeable and will not be steering you to the more expensive bottles. Our friends insisted we try the ""menu Midi"" @ €45. Yes, you read that correctly.  Two bottles of the recommended regional Chateau Bas came to €76. Great local cheese plate is a mere €13. Total, including water and coffees, came to €285 for a memorable meal, with delightful service in a lovely dining room with spectacular views.  Yes, we loved it - next time it's the more expensive menu though it's likely to be just different, rather than 'better'...","1","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-10-25","2019-10-25","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r721158370-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"

Aponem truly gives you an experience you've never had before. Every dish was a piece of art and mouth-watering.
One gentle advice to the sommelier is to serve a broader variety of drinks for non-alcohol drinking guests accompanying the marvelous dishes, that would really make it complete.

To be honest I cant really improve on the first review, which accurately describes our experience. We did book in advance and were lucky to be given the last table available for the day, in the winter months when the veranda dinning area is unavailable the internal restaurant is limited to only 7 tables. When presented with the menu we were a little confused to read : menu of 38 euros, menu of 55 euros, no idea or description of what was on each menu. This was later explained by the charming staff, and we were given the impression that all we had to do was sit back relax and enjoy the culinary experience, which we did. 
The wine list is extensive and slightly confusing as we had no idea what we were going to eat, so unsure what the best wine to go with it was, we just went with the sommeliers recommendation, which proved to be excellent.
Sadly I had to come back to England, but I know my family plans to revisit the Aponem  in December, I am jealous.","3","","FAMILY","2018-11-30","2018-11-25","2018-11-25","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r635610383-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"

Fortune had smiled upon us this Monday for having discovered all other restaurants were shut we were blessed to be offered the last two remaining covers at this recently under-a-new-team opened gem of a place. From the go this tiny shrine to the gods of gourmand presented impeccable service and charm, the front of house welcoming and attentive - as well as fluent in spoken English which we found essential when the various plates were explained, my grasp of French sadly rusty. From the menu of two choices (the accompanying wine suggestions sadly not taken due to chauffeuring duties) we sensibly opted for the full Aponem. What followed was a succession of impeccable plates of creativity, beautifully executed and cooked with great passion and love. Organic ingredients sourced from either the region or their own garden had been prepared to maximise flavour and the presentational skills displayed showed the young team have all learnt their craft from the best and will no doubt make this a rising star to be watched very carefully. 
We will be revisiting Aponem again very soon - next time I'll make sure I'm not driving so as to include the accompanying wine reccomendations. 
Merci a tous au restaurant et Bonne Chance!
(Oh - Booking Essential; they were fully reserved until end of the month!!)","3","","COUPLES","2018-09-30","2018-09-20","2018-09-20","en","Aponem - Auberge du Presbytere","15027610","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r618178792-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html"
