Like other commentators, I am also not a vegetarian  and when I saw the menu was skeptical. Well, it was awesome food throughout the dinner. Tasty and savors, tastes never tried before. The chef uses little known and local herbs, plants and vegetables,  masterfully combined in delicious dishes. 
Portion and the menu are well balance. Service excellent with the chef in the room almost all the time.

Food: Excellent 5/5

The location is great, the staff is good, the food is ok. The fact it's a vegetarian only restaurant has nothing to do with it. Or maybe it does, as prices are extremely high. Higher than most Michelin starred restaurants I've been to. certainly more than most 1 star restaurants.

Overall the experience is worth it, once! And this only if you don't care about the bill at all.","0","","FAMILY","2023-04-30","2023-07-06","2023-07-06","en","La Distillerie","1015502","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r900848687-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html"

And I must say that I'll do it again, and again, and again... :-) The place is gorgeous, in the castle of Bourlingster. Really impressive. We were then warmly welcomed by the team and started with the menu. It was an amazing vegetal journey... Wine pairing was very good too... All the flavours were perfectly balanced, I never missed meat or fish :-) The chef was also actively present around the tables, answered our questions and is also very sympathetic.

Because the menu we had at La Distillerie was a truly eye opening experience! From the radish served in the edible soil until the heart of the sunflower every single dish was spectacular! The balance, and the way each flavor complimented each other, was simply perfect! The service was top notch, as one would expect in this level establishment, and the timing of the dishes was impeccable.

Food: 5","Fantastic","I had booked a table for 3 (my wife, 6 year old son and myself) for lunch on Mothers' Day at the restaurant. I am  a regular customer of the Brasserie (which is great and has in my view the best price to quality ratio in Luxembourg), and the second visit to the restaurant.
My wife and I opted for the vegetarian menu. There are not many words to describe the food other than to say that it is a true revelation; compared to the earlier visit, I think it still has gone op a notch. The research that the Chef is putting into the local flora, the range of (local) herbs that he uses in his food, the complexity of flavors that he creates with vegetables and herbs only, and the extraordinary combinations are a testimony to the chef's talent and passion.
My son had a smaller version of the menu (which does however feature the same dishes) - and I liked the fact that all of the amuse-bouche came for the 3 of us. 
We really enjoyed this fantastic meal.
I have been to many Michelin restaurants, most of them are great - with the focus on herbs and vegetables at this level, the Distillerie is however special - and in my view, one of the best vegetable based restaurants in the world.","1","","NONE","2020-06-30","2020-06-16","2020-06-16","en","La Distillerie","1015502","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r757532703-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html"

All you can hear is other customers talking. its a chateau, they should have had a fireplace, or atleast curtains at the very least. all wuld have been forgiven but the meal was just bad, the central theme was smoke, the smokiness in some of the courses was actually the only good taste, we tried the veg and the non-veg course,  understandably the vegetables were seasonal and one would expect them to be tasty or interesting. It was neither, from a potato dish that had a lot of  raw potato pieces, to oven baked cabbage leaves, celery bits on cabbage, nothing tasted good. The dessset was the biggest let down, i left most of my dishes on the plate and the hostess would only smile and say hope it was ok, well I left most of it so .... I really wanted to like it but it was below par, the wine was good not standout, but at 400 euros for two people, i would take my money elsewhere. I was still hungry when i left the restaurant.","0","","NONE","2020-01-31","2020-03-05","2020-03-04","en","La Distillerie","1015502","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r749192023-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html"

When I told my son where I was going he said "" I hope your not hungry!""
One of the couses was literally one cherry cut in half covered with some cheese. 
As a special effect for dessert the waiter brought dry ice in a bowl and poured Hermes Perfum over it so the table would be covered in perfumed smoke ( what the heck?)
When we left with a bill of 630€ for 4, the chef who had sat down at the table next to us, did not even look up let alone said good-bye. 
If they want another Michelin Star they need to step it up and polish up on their manners! Also, the toilets are not up to standard.
Will NOT go back!

The service was great and the food - WOW! Most outstanding was the vegetarian options and the sorbets for dessert. You can really feel in the taste that the products used are no less than the best available quality. 
So if you want to spend a fortune without getting half of the kingdom, by all means eat here!","0","","BUSINESS","2017-09-30","2017-09-24","2017-09-24","en","La Distillerie","1015502","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r527073182-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html"

It offers four signature menus with seasonal foods, each with a regular and a ""vegetarian"" version, starting at 150 € per person and with the possibility to have a wine selection, namely one glass of wine coupled with each dish. Make sure you can stand several glasses of wine if you opt for the wine selection :). The cuisine has clearly a French base, but revisited with a lot of creativity in the use of ingredients and a presentation of courses which itself is worth the price. We took the ""small"" signature menu and I can say that you really don't leave hungry. I will not go in detail with the courses cause it is subject to change and available on the website, but I can say that if you like a creative cuisine and you don't want to stick to traditional dishes, this place is worth a visit. The great location and the supportive but not invasive staff makes the rest.","0","","COUPLES","2017-06-30","2017-08-23","2017-08-23","en","La Distillerie","1015502","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r516607978-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html"
