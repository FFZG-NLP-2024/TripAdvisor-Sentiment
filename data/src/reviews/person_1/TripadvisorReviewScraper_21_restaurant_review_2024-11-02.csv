The salad with seeds didn't really taste good and the tortellini with cream could get you in jail if the restaurant was in Italy. The tomatoes were excellent though, as well as the tamal (sort of mais-cake) and I liked the dessert too. Kind of sad having asparagus in the menu but not putting them in the tasting experience since it's basically the most representative vegetable of the season. We even asked to  asked to have them but nope. Anyway the staff is very nice and suggested us good wines. The price is just too high, they probably raised it because of the Michelin green star I guess. There are better (vegi) restaurants in Zürich. Thanks for having us anyway.","2","","FRIENDS","2022-05-31","2022-05-04","2022-05-04","en","KLE Restaurant","20049239","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188113-d20049239-r837228287-KLE_Restaurant-Zurich.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Below our (perhaps too high?) expectations","We always wanted to eat at Kle during one of our trips to Zurich. So our expectations were high when we finally managed to reserve a table in time. Unfortunately, our expectations were not fulfilled at all:
We were informed that we had exactly 2 hours to eat in this Michelin-starred restaurant. When we arrived at 5:45 p.m., there was a sign at the door asking us to wait outside, which is not exactly pleasant in autumn temperatures. Once we were let in (5:55 p.m.), we ordered the 4-course menu. We were asked each time whether we liked it, and we answered ""too sour, too raw, just not an explosion of flavor, just not savoureux."" In response to our criticism, we were brought an additional course without asking us whether we wanted it. Unfortunately, this one wasn't great either, although it was a little better than the others. At least the dessert was good and met our expectations.
We have to admit, we have traveled a lot around the world, spend a lot of money on eating out and have been to a few vegan/vegetarian restaurants, but we didn't understand Kle's cuisine. The friendly service and homely atmosphere don't help either.","0","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-30","2023-10-30","en","KLE Restaurant","20049239","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188113-d20049239-r923640772-KLE_Restaurant-Zurich.html"

Very fine food with attention to detail and great service, where we felt very comfortable.

We were a little concerned at first with only 2 hours, but it was completely enough and you can see that a well-harmonized team works together at 
KLE.

I am a chef in Lucerne myself and really appreciate evenings like this of this quality.

I just wanted to report back, because feedback is very important these days

And encouraging, because unfortunately there are other voices on the Internet that I have seen that are absolutely not appropriate! 

You can never please everyone and if these people would take a little look at your concept, some things in this world would be a lot friendlier! ;-)

Keep it up! We think it's great
