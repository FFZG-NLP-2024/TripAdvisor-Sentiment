The service is fine, it's about what you'd expect at that price point, but not beyond. Don't go in expecting fun surprises, but your water glass will remain full and your napkin will (usually) be replaced when you get up and go to the bathroom.
The food is so jaw-droppingly unremarkable you'll wonder if someone is playing a trick on you. I just finished dining there, and this was the big occasion dining experience of my honeymoon, and no joke the best things I had tonight were some broth and a nice little bite of brown butter ice cream. That's not acceptable at a such a price point.
Do I regret going to Maaemo? Obviously, but at the same time, it was kind of funny and inspiring. It makes me want to work harder and now I'm quite certain that if I spent a few months preparing, I too could make a Michelin quality meal.
Service: four stars, Food: one star.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-08","2024-09-08","en","Maaemo","2447055","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r968892334-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

Atmosphere: 5","Unique, intimate and understated.  Interesting juice pairing.","The hardest lunch choice is what to drink.  I’m normally a fan of pairing wines and Maaemo does what I really like and offers three different quality packages (at three different price levels).  But buying wine in Norway is a bit overextravagant under any circumstances - the NOK 16000 ‘Holy Grail’ pairing, while it would undoubtedly have been divine, was no exception.  Many guests limited themselves to water but we went for a juice pairing which was an unexpected delight.  Mixtures like cherry juice with a hint of nettle and toasted hazelnut were surprisingly successful (especially when pairing a dish with hazelnut in the sauce) - I’ll have a go at making some of the mixtures myself now.

Food (in the 14 courses) mostly superb, some merely very good.  For me the starters and main courses beat the desserts (three ice cream dishes perhaps one too many) with the signature oyster/mussel and king crab/reindeer combos as highlights. Coffee weak. Unlimited water.

Ambience superb, service formal and a little subdued but extremely attentive, around 10 tables each of 1 or 2 people when we were there.  Amusingly we sat next to one gentleman whose vacations consisted mostly of visiting the world’s best restaurants (and told everyone in earshot about his visits).  He felt the restaurant lacked a star performer on the service team (maitre d’ or whatever) which was to him essential in a top restaurant.  Maaemo indeed works with a flat org structure front of house so for someone to whom a star performer out front is critical to their enjoyment - well go elsewhere or forget your prejudice and just enjoy the dishes.  No background music until the last couple of dishes were served.

Prices as advertised - very high; but that’s Norway for you.  Watch out when reservations open - I tried for supper the day of our visit and the restaurant was fully booked half an hour before reservations were supposed to open. Lunch was still available.  Maybe there’s a secret trick that increases your chance of success ….","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/41/05/14/caption.jpg

The service professional even so maybe a little bit lacking genuin warmth, The food of course in general good as you expect from a 3* Restaurant, especially the oyster, the mackerel and their sliced lamb-suckling were delicious. Just compared to other 3* places most dishes were lacking elaborated details and surprises. The non alcoholic pairing was as well a little uninspired and starters (amuse bouche) as well as the sweets towards the end of the dining experience (the parts to be taken on the lower floor) a bit too simple “sweet&fatty” and thus a bit disappointing. Maybe they are a bit too much reclining on old accolades and their fancy location.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/1d/d0/e8/caption.jpg

It reopened in 2019 and was awarded three Michelin stars. Its predecessor (which won three Michelin stars in 2016 but closed 9 years after its opening) is located above the train tracks leading to Oslo Central Station and is only 300 meters away from the old site. The name comes from the Old Norwegian translation of ‘Mother Earth’, although its chef Esben Holmboe Bang is actually Danish. But since he has spent most of his culinary career in Oslo, his cooking style is to explore the flavors of local Norwegian ingredients. According to him, 85% of the ingredients come from within 30 miles of Oslo, and the rest of the seafood on the menu, such as wild salmon cooked in salt butter, comes from the pristine waters of the northern coast of Norway.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/04/04/3a/dish.jpg

Food waaaaaaaay below 3 star quality.  Small bites were good, their oyster dish was very fishy, crab too salty, we asked for no mushrooms (and they said yes but had to remind-several times), there was a 30 min gap between one dish, we sent back a glass of merlot that was quite bad (from the Rhone) and rest of dishes very average.  Wine list not up to 3 star restaurant (but reasonably priced…for Oslo)-but we bought a 500$ Mersault which was quite good.  Very nice room.  BIG problem is Chef who thinks he is Guy Savoy (and is not)-they asked for feedback and we mentioned the above and Chef came to our table HOT and berated us-mentioning he did not have a microwave and suggested we could end our dining experience.  We gladly we took him up on that and saved a lot of money.  I have always believed that Norway is a kind and gentile place but when a 6 foot +++ Chef lords over your table and you have in your party one of the only non-white people in the restaurant you have to wonder…sorry Norway but don’t worry Chef is Danish.","4","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-20","2024-02-20","en","Maaemo","2447055","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r939050902-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

Found in the Oslobukta neighborhood diners begin and end in the lounge while a high-ceilinged dining room utililzes organic materials and dramatic lighting to draw attention to an open kitchen working in near silence across 15 courses.

Danish by heritage, though Esben’s plates consistently pay homage to Norwegian traditions, it comes as no surprise that Dinner begins with Potato Lompe topped in Cod plus Horseradish before proceeding through bites including Foie Gras, local Cheese and raw Beef topped in Pine Cone Vinegar.

Occasionally giving in to ""New Nordic"" ideals, though Butter and Fat see Maaemo’s flavors trend more rich than its contemporaries, plates in the dining room began with smoked Vendace Roe perfumed by elderflower that paired beautifully to 2020 Benjamin Leroux Chassagne-Montrachet.

Benefited by faultless service, every staff member executing at the highest level of personal yet professional engagement, Scallops arrived next with tart Fruits preceding Bang’s iconic Flat Oyster with Blue Mussels and Dill that has been a mainstay since 2010.

Pulling back in terms of intensity with a subtle plate of Turnips and Nettles, then serving a recently added slice of Char in a complicated Sauce that vacillates from sweet to savory, the night’s “main course” featured half a roasted Quail with Plums and Sunchokes alongside golden Milk Bread and a decorative spread made from Mushrooms with Garlic.

Cleansing the palate with earthy Consomme, bold but nuanced and a good bridge to Dessert placing Rhubarb amidst florals, it is here that diners return to the lounge for Coffee and sweets including Maaemo’s historic Brown Butter Ice Cream and hot, sticky Cinnamon Buns.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/5b/72/4c/caption.jpg

Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive.

When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.

I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars.

I can't recommend this place unless you're rich and cost doesn't matter much to you.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/07/19/43/caption.jpg

Food: 5","An extraordinary experience that is highly recommended","The only trouble with this establishment was finding the entrance, something that took a walk around the block, as we missed it at first glance.  It is discretely located on the corner of a block,  with an unassuming wooden door, where the only clue is a small brass plate above a door buzzer.  
Other than that a perfect experience.  We found the difficulty in finding the entrance something to laugh about, not troubling.  Nonetheless, be sure to arrive a bit early, in order to locate the entrance.
We appreciated being given a small folder with a  list of all of the courses, once

Once you buzz the door, you enter the vestibule where your coats are taken.
Then you proceed to the ""living room"" downstairs, where welcome drinks and the first three to four courses are served.  Beautiful pieces of art to look at!  To describe these starters as an explosion of tastes would not do them true service.  These hors dóuevres are a carefully orchestrated gustatory  symphony of contrasting and complimenting tastes.  Be aware that the champagne costs extra.  

After the starters,  you proceed to the dining room on the main floor, where several more courses are served, each one an experience in itself, with balanced combinations of flavours that I would not have imagined.  Each dish was lovely to look at, delightful to tase.

Then it is back to the ""living room"" to wind down with desserts.

The service was excellent, formal and highly attentive, yet still friendly and approachable with any questions.  The staff worked as a well-orchestrated team to ensure that the diners were served their courses with precision, and that any questions were answered.
You can watch the cooks make the final preparations with precision.

We were a party of four, where I was the only one to take the wine package, which was very good, but perhaps a bit of a let-down given the price tag.  Nonetheless, I would probably go for the wine pairing again if I did it once more.  Be aware that each glass of wine is for about three courses.  One of the others took two glasses of wine, one white and one red, with the main courses. and were very pleased.  One member of the group  took a non-alcoholic beverage pairing which was remarkably good, an unconventional combination of ingredients that resulted in an impressive drink.

Yes, this experience does costs a small fortune, but it is worth it.  It was impressive on so many levels.

Be aware that this is a set menu.  I doubt that it would appeal to vegetarians or those with special dietary needs.","1","","NONE","2022-11-30","2022-11-14","2022-11-14","en","Maaemo","2447055","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r868403022-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

Food: 5","Pure bliss","I still cannot stop smiling when I think of what a good time we had at Maaemo. The interior, the decor, the atmosphere and last but not least the staff and the FOOD! I had been wanting to go since they opened twelve years ago but somehow I never managed to get a reservation and when I finally did, I had to cancel because of covid. But it certainly was worth the long wait. My husband and I could not even decide which dishes we liked best. Normally, we enjoy the starters, but it’s downhill from there because the main dishes are too large (and boring) when one would prefer to have more, and smaller, dishes to be able to taste more things. Not so here. Everything was perfect. And the dishes included all our favourite foods! We particularly enjoyed the innovative and creative takes on traditional  foodstuffs like the outstanding dish with reindeer hearts as well as the dishes with caviar from different sources. And pinnekjøtt more interesting than any I have had before. And lomper, shrimp, scallops, king crab, mushrooms and strawberries as well as  duck leg, beef, turbot, peas, quail and brioche and rhubarb. Even now, I am unable to say what I liked best. Interesting matching wines, too. And did I mention the outstanding staff? I was smiling all evening. Pure bliss.

Oops, I almost forgot. A good review needs something negative. Mhh, well … I couldn’t eat my second cinnamon bun. In retrospect, I would have loved to take it home. They were quite tasty, after all  Sorry, but this is all the negative I can come up with.

Food: 3","High Hopes--Disappointing","I was thrilled to get a reservation at Maaemo, the northernmost Michelin three-star restaurant in the world. I'm sorry to have to say I was disappointed. I expect any three-star restaurant to have pretensions about its food, but I found Maaemo beyond pretentious. The servers were nice enough but so formal that the effect was chilling. First we we were taken to a dimly lit basement room for our starters. I could barely see what I was eating!  As each of the five  one-bite starters were presented, the waiter recited the ingredients--each of the five seemed to have five ingredients!

Precisely one hour later (everything here is timed to the  minute), I and the other diners were escorted up  to the dining room. The decor was stark but attractive and there was was more light here. My waitress stood  at my table and recited the ingredients of each of the eight main courses. Again, she was nice, but stiff. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, ""So, what's the next course going to be?"" ""Oh, I can't tell you that ahead of time."" (To be fair, she gave me a hint.)

The food itself was generally good, but only a few dishes stood out as excellent--disappointing for a three-star restaurant. And  I'm all for innovative food pairings, but the ""shoulder of crab with reindeer heart"" took this concept a bit over the top. I must say that every course was artistically plated. An hour and a half later, to the second, it was downstairs again, for dessert. I enjoyed most of the desserts more than I had enjoyed the starters. 

Half an hour later came the check, which was exorbitant, but not inappropriately so. This was not my favorite restaurant meal, but it was my most interesting restaurant experience.

Maaemo, please lighten up a bit!","3","","NONE","2022-07-31","2022-08-08","2022-08-08","en","Maaemo","2447055","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r852898542-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"

Food: 5","A magical place","There are very few restaurants in the world that take your breath away when you enter them because you realise: This is something special, something magical! Maaemo definitely is one of them. Within the first few minutes of entering the building, chatting with the staff, and climbing downstairs to the living room, you realise you are in for an unforgettable night. Maaemo has a unique, elegant and focused but still very cosy style. It elevates your mood immediately. And the food is right up there with the very best in the world: Every single one of the small bites served in the living room at the beginning of the meal is spectacular in all preparation, presentation, and taste. Entering the main dining room upstairs is another wow moment. It is one of the most beautiful restaurant settings I have seen, with an impressive open kitchen, a fire place, and spectacular art on all walls of the very high room. Throughout the meal, the interactions with staff and the quality of food are kept at highest level. The absolute highlight of our menu was a filet of line caught Norwegian salmon that was by far the best piece of fish I have ever tasted. It had nothing in common with the regular salmon you get in other restaurants or supermarkets. With its perfect combination of a light sea taste, seductive fat layers, and creamy texture it seemed to come from a different world. After that, the main course of the menu was the only disappointment of our visit: A piece of lamb, proudly presented at the table before being roasted over the grill, had barely any taste. An anticlimax to an otherwise flawless meal. The night at Maaemo ends with delicious friandises and coffee (roasted and brewed to perfection on-site) served downstairs again. The cinnamon buns are so good that you should seize the opportunity and take a few extra ones with you to enjoy the next day. This is one way of prolonging this fantastic experience for a few more hours. The memories, however, will stay forever.","1","","NONE","2022-07-31","2022-07-11","2022-07-11","en","Maaemo","2447055","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r847291755-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html"
