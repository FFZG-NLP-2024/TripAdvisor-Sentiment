We have never had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant so thought we would take the opportunity and visit. 
From our arrival being met at the bottom of the stairs, we were treated like long lost best friends, very spoiled and very loved :) The food was sensational and the service was spectacular. We booked a table at the open kitchen bench which was fab so we chatted to Chef Jimmy all the way through every course. Wonderful degustation journey and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Phuket - it's about 15 minutes north of Laguna where we were staying.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/37/44/65/caption.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","3 star aspirations","Recently reopened after an extensive renovation PRU focuses on ""community-to- fork"" gastronomy from Chef Jimmy Ophorst, a location just steps from Phuket's most exclusive resort affording visitors a luxury experience previously unavailable in the area.

An acronym for “Plant. Raise. Understand.,” Jimmy and his team going to great lengths in explaining why Ingredients are chosen and how they are showcased, guests are welcomed in the lobby where Thai Sparkling Wine begins a progressive tasting that soon proceeds to a fully open kitchen. 

A short ride from Phuket’s top Resorts, nearby Trisara playing host to a modern building with on-site gardens, it is in the lobby that diners nibble on small bites including a Kimchi Pancake before taking a front and center seat in front of chefs that are friendly and engaging.

Truly a celebration of Thailand’s bounty, Ophorst willfully choosing unique ingredients, course one places Durian amidst Shiso and Caviar with spectacular results before moving onward to a slice of Giant Travelly perfumed by  Ceylon Oak that grow 50 meters above the ground.

Obtaining many ingredients from co-owned PRU Jampa Farm, 1.6 hectares of organic soil available for tours, Bread arrives with too much (IE just enough) local Butter prior to Black Crab Curry given complexity by Tea and a Fennel Bulb baked in Pastry atop Sauce bolstered by Vanilla.

A bold and concise sort of cuisine, no extraneous additions but every dish an expression of the Chef with faultless cooking, Coral Grouper is perhaps the most straight-forward presentation of the night – especially in comparison to Squid in Blue Cheese with laminated Rolls to sop up the excess. 

Finishing savories with rosy Duck Breast in a peppered Sauce as complex as Mole it is by way of Guava Granita heated by Pepper that the palate is cleansed en route to Banana with Salted Plum and Citrus.

Back to the lounge to finish, four Mignardises followed by Coffee and Chocolates, PRU may only currently hold 1* from Michelin but the cooking achieves at a 2* level with 3* aspirations and the means to get there.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/15/ca/f9/caption.jpg

We had a cocktail in the bar prior to dinner made by Tus, which was amazing then we had the 5 course tasting menu with premium wine pairing. The service was impeccable especially Alfredo, Chalong and Pla. The food was incredible, very intricate and we enjoyed most of the dishes. There was an amuse bouche that wasn't to my taste at all but that is personal taste nothing to do with quality!  I was beyond amazed and grateful how they catered for myself being allergic to gluten. My dishes were created the same as my husband and super impressive and that is a rarity! You just need to allow the team 48hrs notice to cater for gluten free. 
We were also informed on booking regards the dress code 'resort chic' and states no swimwear or flip flops, so we were very disappointed when the table we had to look at all night in front of us had been allowed into the restaurant in beach wear - swim shorts, t-shirt and reef shoes!!! Not what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant at all, cheapens the experience and disappointing that the team did not refuse the guests to enter and enforce their dress code. 
We would also feedback that the wine pairing was great but we would have liked the sommelier to elaborate on why each wine was paired with the dishes to give a more detailed and elevated experience.

Really happy with it. It may possibly be the best dinner I have ever had. 
The asian ingredients were fused seamlessly with western ideas and ingredients.
There were nice suprises like 2 amuses before the dinner. A little bag of treats to take home. Interesting bread and butters and a complex palette cleanser towards the end.
The portion sizes were pretty good. Our booking was at 7pm and we both had a dish at around 3pm before going so by the end of it we were both happy. If we didn't have the 3pm dish and hung out all day I imagine we would have left a bit hungry. However, in my view it's an experience you are going for, not a big feed.
I think if we just opted for the 5 courses it may have perhaps felt a little too light. I would recommend the 7 course.
The dishes were all incredibly intricate. I have eaten and worked in michelin starred kitchens in the past and even compared to my past experiences this was very very detailed and intricate food. 
I had to put my glasses on to see all the components so I can't imagine trying to plate these up.
The flavours and textures were pretty good. I particularly liked how they infused the pea tart with a BBQ flavour.
It was phenomenal but I do have some feedback. My friend commented the butters were lacklustre. They wern't bad but I felt the tamarind butter was a little underwhelming and the salted butter tasted like Anchor with salt on top. Could be improved.
The main thing was the descriptions. We are both Chefs and do the dinner for a bit of inspiration as well and like to really analyze everything and understand what each component is. 
I get the short menu descriptions. I don't particularly like long old school descriptions either. The staff explained each dish pretty well but even asking them to repeat sometimes it is hard to understand and we didn't want to be throwing 20 questions for every dish. I imagine we understood about 70% of what we were eating and a person that's not a Chef probably like 40 or 50%. Maybe a more detailed menu available on request I don't know.
Other minor thing was odd questions before the dinner on the phone and during the dinner. ""What hotel are you staying at"". ""Did you come by car or"". Happy to answer. I'm not a secret agent but would be nice to know why they need this information.
The atmosphere was nice and relaxed but that's another area they could really do something cool and improve with. 
Service for the most part was great. They had a good knowledge of the food they were serving and English was pretty good just a few words we got lost with. 
Anyway overall it was a lovely dinner. Total cost for 2 people 7 courses and a few random drinks each was around 20,000 baht. 
Certainly worth it if you appreciate the food but if you don't appreciate the food then I wouldn't bother spending so much on a dinner.
Look forward to returning in the future if they ever have a new menu to try.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/4c/ec/08/caption.jpg

I have always asked myself if I really need Michelin starred restaurants in Phuket where there is so much food readily available everywhere you turn and the answer is simple, yes you do. Of course you do! Phuket is developing fast and it's only right that Pru is rated so highly. From the start, you know that you are in for something special, the welcome is genuine and the service, food and the location are all spot on.

Special occasion location at prices that are very easy to achieve if you like to eat in Singapore! I think it is well worth the price tag, love the steak knives by the way (and have ordered from the factory!) cannot wait to return later in the year!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/db/3f/ea/the-chateau-muscar-an.jpg

Concept, services, and presentations are similar to French Laundry in Napa Valley, California; but honestly, not even closed!  Food taste with lack of convictions why they taste the way they should, I find the food as though the chefs wanted to create a highly complexed of inventing Thai food to international discoveries. Sorry to say, I think most of the dishes failed miserably as such!  I remember the time we visited French Laundry several years ago, some of dishes I had I wanted them to linger in my mouth forever. PRU’s creations were far from the mighty sensations. 
Service was great, the verbal presentation of both food and wine paring were confusing.  Price  was expensive, at $400 per person for 7 - course meal including wine parring, it wasn’t closed to “wonderfully delicious”.  Wine parring choices were a bit of second or third grade comparing to Napa Valley or French wines.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/21/f4/51/cd/caption.jpg

The menu appears unassuming but each course included more than we thought it would. We did the 7 course meal with wine pairing and added on the caviar supplement offered. The meal itself included way more than 7 courses - 3 bites as an amuse-bouche, various breads and butters, a beautiful cheese selection of cheeses from all over Thailand (creamy, blue, goat, etc) with jam and honey, a small “pre dessert” of Phuket pineapple and ice cream, and a final tasting of multiple different desserts aside from what was included on the menu. 

The duck was amazing. The sauces on the grouper were delicious. My favorite dish (which is hard to choose) was the red mullet with black garlic - had a crispy sour dough crust with delicious sauces. 

We left full and incredibly happy - even with a little bag of goodies from the chef! Pricing is on par for a higher end Michelin star restaurant..might even be a tad cheaper than some. Would recommend coming here for an amazing meal with wonderful hospitality - Tong and Kat were great as was the rest of the staff.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/21/65/00/ed/caption.jpg

The result was the same as last time: it's pretty good, but nothing special.

In addition the following:

It is fantastic that all the products that are served here come from Thailand and that the cuisine can be described as extremely sustainable.

The products are all very good, the combinations in the dishes are sometimes very good and sometimes not so good. So it was more of a mixed experience. But that's just a matter of taste.

But the following has bothered us: if they commit themselves to sustainability, but at the same time they serve water from Italy, it is more than irritating. If I want to eat sustainably and do this with Thai products, I don't want to drink water that was transported 10,000 km here. This is ecological nonsense. We therefore only ordered good Thai water.

Given the very high prices, one can expect a sommelier to be on hand to advise. that is not the case here.

The staff are very difficult to understand, their English is not too good. But the staff is extremely friendly, that has to be said.

The Thai cheese is extremely good, really. With a view to sustainability, it is very strange that the morning buffet at Trisara serves only imported cheese - I would prefer much the Thai cheese!","2","","FAMILY","2021-10-31","2021-10-25","2021-10-25","en","PRU Restaurant","11913607","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r815984790-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html"

The food and the experience is as good as the narrative of PRU story - i e what the chef wants to tell us both conceptually but also in every taste created. I went for the 7-course menu, which was not too much at all considering the portion of each course (not a complain). Clearly this is an European style cuisine but definitely inspired by Thai A LOT, for which I enjoyed it very much. Overall I would recommend this however if i can be a bit picky: 2 things didnt work out well for me. 1) the perfume smell of the restaurant and the oshibori/wet towel was too strong till a point I felt bit distracted and annoyed. 2) I would recommend the dish of the wild mushroom can be served later as the taste and smell was fairly strong, which was carried over to my taste for the subsequent course (despite I drank a whole class of water!)","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/85/f1/72/caption.jpg

The food itself isn't the best that I have ever tried, but the service is impeccable and they try hard to live up with their brand on sustainability and connection with ingredients. 
As a vegetarian, I always appreciate it that the restaurant can have a dedicated vegetarian menu to ""normalize"" our status instead of just making us trouble makers with special dietary requirement. PRU is doing good with it. :)
Before the meal begins, the view outside the restaurant was already a feast to the eye! They also pulled out a special box of ingredients to give a preview on what I will be eating. What I would suggest is that they make a nice e-brochure and attach a QR code with the presentation box so that interested audience can check out more details online.
I ordered the vegetarian menu with non-alchoholic drinks for food pairing. The juices come along with the dishes are interesting gem themselves. Too bad that they did not come onto the menu too. 
The food came in 5 dishes, plus a P.R.U. signature appetizer, bread to begin with, cheese tasting, pre-dessert, and lastly tea with condiments. I later found out that the cheese and tea came with additional price only when I paid the bill. I don't have a problem with that but they should have told me in advance. 
 I was a bit surprised when they served bread at the beginning and in fact there is so much food to come. Given the price of the dinner, the bread was definitely the most expensive artisan bread I have ever tried. I was a bit hungry after the ""main dish"" but the ""cheese tasting"" later made me totally full! The waiter introduced various cheese produced in Thailand and I had the chance to taste them all - definitely a dream came true for a cheese lover! The soft ones made from goat cheese were stronger than I would have thought, but I prefer them to the cow cheese ones.
At the end when I left, there was also a souvenir of two bottle of jams but I have not tasted them. The hand-written card was sweet too.
Overall I think the food was great and all staff endeavored to make it a great experience beyond tastes. Thanks for the great evening and the great food!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/7a/fe/c8/caption.jpg
