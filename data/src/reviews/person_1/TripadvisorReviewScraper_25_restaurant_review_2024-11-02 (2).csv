The restaurant looks small from most photographs but it is not but it feels quite intimate.

Be prepared to have a bit of a wait to be seated however you will be given a glass of something to help the time pass.

We were lucky enough to have a view of the parilla and to see so much prime steak being cooked was a total pleasure.

As soon as you are seated food is delivered ,perfect empanadas to whet your appetite.

Starters are varied and we found the ember baked beetroot carpaccio delicious especially with a whole baked sheep’s cheese.

The sausage selection was first class.

The steak was of course perfect and we found a Tbone and a butterflied sirloin more than enough for four.

The sommelier had excellent knowledge of the extensive list and gave first class advice.

All of the staff were very attentive and added to the enjoyment of our visit.

A wonderful experience in this outstanding and very lively restaurant","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r978347010-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

Excellent empanadas and chorizo for starters, an absolutely huge and truly delicious steak, washed down with a great Argentinian Malbec.

The staff were first class and very friendly and the ambience was authentic old style with a classy feel.

Be prepared to wait in line outside even with a reservation, although we found the greeting staff to be polite with them offering a welcome drink to those waiting.

Whilst it’s not a cheap night out here, it’s certainly worth a visit and is highly recommended.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r977103132-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

Despite of Reservation we had to wait in the queue and get atiny table outside instand of inside","I reserved a table in the Restaurant 2 Months ago because I read an Artikel in a Swiss Newspaper. I reserved a table inside the Restaurant and had to confirm it twice one day before Arrival.
When we arrived there was a Long queue in Front of the Restaurant. I Said ‚I have a Reservation‘. They told me: ‚Go in the Queue‘
We had to wait half an Hour. They told me they have overbooked. In the end we received a small table outside - it was a rainy evening. 
The mushrooms I ordered were out. The Food and the Service at the table were good. But I am still disappointed that they overbook and that it is not possible to get the table at the time and Place it was reserved.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e1/42/77/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-24","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r976426837-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

They responded promptly and confirmed  our reservation. The restaurant was quite busy for a Monday. Reception staff were warm, friendly, and efficient. She showed us to our table as soon as she confirmed our reservation. Wait staff were outstanding. They gave us time to get settled in and go over the menu. Their wine list is extensive. We started with arugula salad. Fresh, tasty, and enough to share with two people. Our T Bone steak was simply delicious. It was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly as we requested. The grilled mushrooms were sweet and smokey. Their desserts were well worth the extra calories. This is a great place for steaks.

We showed up a little ahead of time for our reservation and they seemed very confused and disorganized.  We had to wait more than 10 minutes past our reservation to be seated, standing awkwardly outside with the smokers.  The service was good.  Not quite what I was hoping based on the expectations.  The starters were excellent, the meals were good.  Yes, you are going to get a good steak here.  You can do that in MANY places in this country, though.  The prices you pay are not returned with a higher value or quality meal from our experience.  We had multiple meals at a nearby steak restaurant that were superior to this and MUCH cheaper.  I'd say, find another option.  It wasn't worth the hype for us.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-09-20","2024-09-20","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r970609335-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

They welcome you with a glass of white sparkling wine and a empanada before you are seated. We sat at an outside table, and even though it was around 14 celsius outside, they had a lot of warmers and blankets.

We ordered a traditional provoleta and they brought a chorizo too (for free). This appetizers were very good, not to out of the ordinary but very good still. Then, we ordered an ojo de bife (ribeye) and a cuadril de bife with a side of mashed potatoes with trouffle shavings and a side of Brussel sprouts. Meat was excellent, maybe the ribeye was a little bit dry but that is just expected from the cut, but the flavor was intensely good. The sides were way out of the ordinary, they were delicious, specially the Brussel sprouts (ordering this is a must).

After a meal made for the gods, we ordered some ice cream for dessert and they brought three flavors, two of which were free (they apparently liked us very much). We had the dulce de leche, samboyan and milk ice cream covered with hot chocolate. The three were very good, I have tried some dulce de leche ice creams that are a little better but the other two were out of this world!

In regards of price, we ordered a lot of food with the outstanding service of the waiters and it was only $60 each including drinks. We also ordered a very expensive wine pairing but I am not reviewing that..","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/33/08/ca/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-19","2024-08-19","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r965645724-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

As there has already been a ton of prose written about Don Julio, I’ll bullet point key observations:

- Reservations: You absolutely need to get a reservation way in advance. As soon as you know you’ll be going to Buenos Aires, go to Don Julio’s website and try to book a reservation. Even if it’s before the roughly 80 days when you can actually reserve the table, you can/should enter your e-mail address to be notified when reservations open up for your desired date/time - this is called a early-access request. Then, when you get the e-mail notifying you that reservations are open for your requested date/time (“Convert your early-access request into a reservation”), immediately go and book a table. But it doesn’t end there - you will get two additional e-mails as your reservation approaches, one to confirm, and then another to confirm again and enter a credit card in case you are a no-show. Obviously, keep an eye out for those in your inbox and respond promptly.
- Arriving: Arrive a few minutes early and expect that you will wait in line to check in for your reservation - for our opening 7p reservation, we waited maybe 7 minutes in line to get to the receptionist. Happily, every now and then a waiter will come by and offer a complimentary glass of spumanti (a carbonated wine drink, like champagne but a bit sweet) to make the time go by faster. 
- Ordering: If you’re not sure about which steak to order, ask your server to take you up to the central open grill where the different cuts are laid out, to show you what’s what.
- Dining: Note that the steaks tend to be lightly salted, at least compared to the sodium-heavy US standard. We found that adding a nice pinch of salt, thoughtfully provided as a matter of course in a small bowl alongside criollo and chimichurri, really brought out the amazing quality of the beef. I might be wrong, but I suspect some of the other reviews mentioning lackluster flavor was due to the lighter salting.
- Service: Our waiter was super friendly and responded enthusiastically to any request we had, like additional oil for our bread, adjusting the table, etc. Just be aware that the service can be more akin to the Argentinian style, where they consider it rude to pester or rush you, so if you want anything, e.g. another glass of wine or the check at the end of the meal, just get your server’s attention and politely ask. Unlike the US, they won’t constantly check on you and then plop a check on your table to turn it over ASAP.  

Is it pricey compared to other parrillas in Buenos Aires? Absolutely, though it’s only mid to upper-range by New York standards. Does it cater to tourists? Yes, at least based on the clientele when we visited. Really, though, the bottom line is that our dinner was the one of the best experiences we’ve had dining out. The lovely ambiance, the amazing food, the thoughtful little extras like the spumanti, and the top-notch service made it a lovely night to remember.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/04/70/f9/caption.jpg

Although close friends, residents of Bs As, recommended we NOT go, we still went. Unfortunately, VERY disappointing meal, inflexible in their salads and very mediocre Entrecôte. Would not go back and would NOT recommend. What a missed opportunity for Argentina. Friendly Somm, one of the nicest cellars in the city. But that was not enough.","0","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-31","2024-07-31","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r962564086-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"

Don julio is the best parrilla in Buenos Aires and among the best in the world. You can argue you will get similar quality elsewhere but this is the best meat and the best representation of what Argentina parrilla is supposed to be. Everyday with consistency. Well worth the star and big proud for Argentina","1","","BUSINESS","2024-06-30","2024-06-16","2024-06-16","en","Don Julio","1066728","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r955407692-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html"
