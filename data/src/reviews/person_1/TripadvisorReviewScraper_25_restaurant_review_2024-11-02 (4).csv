The 45-customer restaurant continues the Catalonian focus but given spectacular depth and scope by Joan’s adaptive creativity.  Feasting on a signature degustacion offering like, say, the “Festival Menu” that we enjoyed, the questing diner understands why Joan’s impressively realized gustatory imaginings made El Celler de Can Roca one of the only four restaurants with multiple “Best Restaurant in the World” accolades - at par with Napa’s “The French Laundry” with two, and only behind the legendary “El Bulli” and Copenhagen’s “Noma” at five Firsts each.

The lagniappe to the experience was to encounter Joan himself three times during the night and engage him in increasingly playful interactions.  There is nothing like a great chef unencumbered by grandiosity but crowned with a wonderful sense of humor.","0","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2024-09-30","2024-09-30","en","El Celler de Can Roca","996088","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r972087809-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html"

Atmosphere: 4","Not Worth a Special Visit","We travelled to Girona specifically to visit this restaurant.  We were so excited to get a reservation and built our trip around this visit.  We wanted to visit after seeing the Chef's Table episode on Netflix and were expecting something very special.  We have been to many Michelin restaurants with a few 3 star under our belts.  This experience was very average and does not align with what one would expect for a 3 star rating.  It was awkward from the moment we entered where there was no one at the front to greet us and we stood around looking for someone to help us out.  We thought maybe we came through the wrong door!!  Not a single question was asked of why we were there (Anniversary, Birthday, etc.) , where we were from, etc..

The restaurant itself is very nice - very comfortable setting with a beautiful natural landscape in the center and nicely spaced tables.  After sitting we waited a while again for the menu and water service, which in Europe I am OK with, but for a place like this it is not acceptable.  These are little things, but definitely not what is expected for a restaurant at this level.  We were at Disfrutar a few nights earlier and the service was exceptional and they made a real effort to appreciate that you were at their establishment.  

As far as the menu goes we opted for the short menu - our mistake - if you do go be sure to get the longer experience because the timing isn't much longer and some key dishes are missing from the short menu - especially the desserts.  The food was good but nothing was exceptional.  Execution and quality of the ingredients is what you would expect, but nothing was good enough to talk to your friends about.  In fact, the main meat dish, which was a take on a beef Wellington, but used poultry elements was just not good and not incredibly original.  The ratio of the dough to the filling was off so there was more crust than needed and not a very tasty execution of the proteins. 

 The biggest letdown was the desserts, the primary reason we came, which were very average.  The first dish was an ensemble made from sheep's milk - this was pretty good and had a cone that had the scent of a sheep which made it kind of fun.  The next dish was confusing.  It was supposed to be a take on the memories from reading books, I think, where the aroma is supposed to based on the smell of old books.  We were given a splash of oil on the hands that was supposed to be this scent, which you licked before embarking on eating the dish.  The dish was not interesting and did not provide any sort of continuity both in flavor or texture and did not seem to align with the theme that was explained to us.  The dish also did not go well with the first dessert because both desserts were pretty heavy milk based recipes.

Finally - in fear of sounding pretentious, when I went to go to the restrooms I was super confused on where they were so I walked back and forth across the mirrored walls looking for the door, which ended my night in a similar way that it started - awkward...  Most Michelin restaurants walk you to the restrooms and ensure that you know your way around.

Our opinion is that El Celler de Can Roca is at a Michelin level but definitely not worth a special trip nor did the service or food stand out as anything special.  We have had more creative dishes both in presentation and flavor at many other restaurants and service was not on par with the other 2 and 3 star restaurants we have visited.  Even many of the one star restaurants had a more immersive and welcoming experience than El Celler de Can Roca.","0","","FAMILY","2024-05-31","2024-05-21","2024-05-21","en","El Celler de Can Roca","996088","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r951771154-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html"

Atmosphere: 2","Do NOT Bother!!!!","We've tried for two years to get a booking as we've lost out to the bots, so we had high hopes for our one-year wedding anniversary dinner after staying up until midnight to get this booking (we got married near Girona, so this place had a lot of meaning.) We also chose to have our wedding dessert from rocambolesc last year so this restaurant meant so much to us. We actually told the staff this, and they didn't care at all!!!!. The last 3 Michelin-starred restaurant we ate at was HÉLÈNE DARROZE last month, and wow, did they bring out all the stops!!! (they made a special newspaper for us and as soon as we entered they told us how grateful they were to choose them to celebrate our lunch with them. From the moment we entered their restaurant, we were made to feel so special. At el celler de can rocca, however,  no one was made to feel special that we could see, especially us! . We chose to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary here, and we truly regret this decision. We had even said before we would bring our wedding party back here for our ten years - sadly, we wouldn't even come back for petit fours. 

When you choose to save and spend your hard-earned money at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant, which is at least £1000 for a couple, you would hope that you at least get greeted well. They couldn't even find out booking initially! 

The food, in all honesty, was pretty boring, void of fun and personality, and everything had a foam or emulsion that tasted the same.

I've never felt the need to say something in a place like this, but I was so frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. When I excused myself and asked to speak to someone, I was met with excuses of how they were going to bring out a dessert for us. However, it was a little too late. The effort should have been made from the moment we arrived. I appreciated the apology, but it wasn't really heart felt. 

This restaurant has no business holding three Michelin stars! That extra star is reserved for the wonderful restaurants that go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and appreciated. 

I had hoped something special would happen at the end the meal to make up for the truly poor experience but it did not manifest. 

take your money elsewhere to restaurants that do not rely on reputation.  

A real, real, really wasted evening!!!!!!!!!!","4","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-05-04","2024-05-04","en","El Celler de Can Roca","996088","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r949511572-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html"

Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.

It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.

The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me,  having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more  theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine! 

The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.

A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!","0","","COUPLES","2022-10-31","2023-08-08","2023-08-08","en","El Celler de Can Roca","996088","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r908812594-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html"

The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre.  The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.

We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience.""  We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours.  A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink.  The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.

Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.

I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.

The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.

Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything.  It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc).  The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.

The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.

A truly memorable experience highly recommended.","1","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-02","2023-08-02","en","El Celler de Can Roca","996088","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r907384675-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html"

Excellent food , well served and explained by our very professional waiter Alex.  13 appetizers followed by the Feast menu of 13 plates may seem a lot but it’s not.  It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment. 
Highlight of the day was the kindness and availability of the 3 Roca brothers who took  time to take a photo with us and were kind enough to show us their kitchen.  Chapeau !!!

Food: 2","Disappointing","We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines).  There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch.   Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post'  - put in my bag for later disposal).  There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac,  the langostine and the caramelised apricot.  Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience.

The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.

Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.

Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience. Do not be intimated by the restaurant’s prestige, the experience is fun, challenging, delicious, and magical.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/29/7a/39/f3/caption.jpg

I found later that Girona, dating back to pre-Roman empire times, is not only a cycling Mecca, the favorite training base of multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, but also the backdrop for many scenes of the popular TV series Game of Thrones. Picturesque and dramatic it certainly is. 

A few years earlier, i had been fortunate enough to have persuaded the chef at 2 Michelin star Dani Maison on the island of Ischia, near Napoles, to open the restaurant for lunch specially for my party of 8, since all dinner reservations had been spoken for many months ago, for the entire week i had been scheduled to be in the area, with none of the cancellations we had been hoping for. 

After we explained the situation and begged (piteously!) several times, the chef had been gracious enough to round up his crew and accommodate us. It was simply the best meal of my life, especially memorable since i make it a point to experience as many Michelin restaurants as i can during my travels. 

We had been sailing the Amalfi Coast, a week of Michelin delight, stopping in at the various coastal towns and villages: to name a few, Capri, Positano, Sorrento and other equally impossibly beautiful and romantic medieval towns, setting our sailing schedule to match the reservations we had been able to procure.

A 3 Michelin meal is supposedly particularly worth making a special trip for. So, it was with great hope and anticipation that we made a transcontinental trip to Barcelona, and then a couple hours north, deep into the separatist province of Catalunya, on the Iberian peninsula, for El Celler de Can Roca. 

My niece Gayatri had somehow managed a snag a reservation for 715pm for this date, due to a cancellation some months prior. So my travel plans were built around this reservation. 

The entrance to the restaurant is dramatic, as the backlit ivy-covered passage walls suddenly open onto a large outdoor seating courtyard visible from the angled floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Since it is winter, and temperatures are quite cold, there were no patrons outdoors, but it must be quite pleasant in warmer times. 

As we entered the restaurant, we found one of the well-coiffed brothers Roca industriously signing the flyleaf of a pile of books on the counter. It appears there is a whole section of coffee table books devoted to recipes and descriptions of the meal we were about to experience. Our salivary glands quivered!

While expensive (prix fixe 270 €) that’s not excessive for 12 courses following 16 appetizers. I had skipped lunch, in anticipation! But it is definitively caloric overkill, while visually and creatively impressive.

We were  informed by the proud waiter that no fewer than 400 fresh organic local ingredients had been used to prepare a specially curated vegetarian meal. 

The venue, service, technical expertise and presentation were impeccable, but i  found the taste itself bland, insipid, unidimensional and uninspired, with many sauces and textures indistinguishable from each other,  a real letdown and disappointment. Oh, well!","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/27/7a/49/b1/caption.jpg
