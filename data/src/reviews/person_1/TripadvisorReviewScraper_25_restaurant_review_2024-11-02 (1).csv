The restaurant is beautiful, whether one eats by the fireplace or al fresco under kiwi trees.  The food is amazing, super well presented (perfect for instagram) and just utterly delicious.  We had the trout menu and loved it all.  Most of all the dessert, a crème brulée with cardamon over kiwis (don't miss it, it is truly incredible).  The service is kind and attentive.  We can't wait to eat there again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-05-13","2024-05-13","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r950711812-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

Very nice decor and the views from the room are on the nature all around. Very nice styling and decorations with a large fire at one end with a warm feel but modern. The food was simply excellent and the presentation was amazing. One of the main positive points was that at the same table we could have 2 different gourmet menus. This is very unusual and a huge plus for this restaurant. The food was really excellent - I had the Autumn menu and my husband the gourmet menù. The food was innovative in putting together so many tastes and cooking styles. Presentation was inspired and works of art. Really not sure we have eaten better with an exception of  a 3 star Michelin. The service was friendly and professional and all the delicious food we ate was described with passion. Great wine as well. We had special requirements which were fully managed. Excellent restaurant on all aspects - we will definitely return.","0","","COUPLES","2022-10-31","2022-11-13","2022-11-13","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r868301163-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

Food is of good quality. Nice ambience.","This is what I believe is the second best restaurant of the Chiavenna area. Passerini Restaurant being the very best, by far!

The ‘specialty’ of Lanterna Verde is Trout, but it has a relatively good menu.
Bread is home made and good and the dishes are of good quality. Not sublime. 

The ambience is quite nice. 
The please is just off the main road that leads to St. Moritz, just before Customs/the Boarder b/w Italy & Switzerland.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/da/a6/63/photo2jpg.jpg

It was evening time and we use google map to find this place on the way to St Moritz from Varenna Italy. 
I have my skeptic feeling about this place until I walked in and I found myself wrong with my feelings. 
It is a beautiful restaurant and the staffs are nice and polite to ask us which table we want to sit because we have no reservation. I think a few table are reserved already but we are the first guests for dinner. 
The menu card is writing in Italy language. We are lucky because our friend translated it in English and German. 
There was a small food served from their kitchen while we wait our order. 
It was a delicious food with Kaviar. 

Our ordered are
Main course:

-Spaghetti Felicetti cacio e pepe, bottarga e romanesco €18

-Gnocchi di calvofiore e di barbabietola, trots, crema acida, cipollina €20

-Tradizionali pizzoccheri di grano saraceno con patate e verza €14

Dessert:
-3 Sorbetti alla frutta di stagione €11

-Mandarine, Mandorle, Caramello €11

-Tortino caldo di cioccolato Grands Crus Valrhona con alchechengi e salsa vaniglia €11

All food are delicious and beautiful in presentation. 

Thank you for wonderful dinner and services. 
I will recommend to my families and our friends.

Food: 5","A paradise hidden in the valley","Lanterna Verde ( litterally Green Lantern ) is one of those restaurant that noboby crossing that aera of Nord Lombardy should miss. Particularly for those reaching Engadina Valley and St Moritz from the Italian border is a must to stop there for lunch or dinner. Lanterna Verde has one Michelin star sice one decade and I have never taste a wrong plate in so many visits I did.
There are a couple of set menu , one based on the tradition the other with some innovation . the quality of the ingrediences is at the top and Nord valley Italy plates are the main receipts. The family running the restaurant by tradition they farm troutes in the cold waters coming from aroud and for those who wish to try this preciouse fresh water fish it a immense pleasure. The presentation of all plates is impeccable and the taste even more. Esquisit appetizer , classis rise and past and main course of great interest where game or particular cuts are always available top breake the monotony of red meet .Very seldom my appetite and taste is challenged to such satisfaction. When choosing wine you will be surprised by the number of labels available , better ask to the boss somelier who will advice you best with some few bottle production lebels impossible to find elsewhere. Most of top wines are there but trust me try some small producers reccomended by them.
Price for 2 with good wine included is less than what you can spent in St Moritz for one person in an average place with non entusiastic food . This place deserve to be visited to the extend that even in vacation in Engadina it merit to be choosen for a night.","0","","FRIENDS","2019-02-28","2019-02-14","2019-02-14","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r652386552-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

Food: 5","Excellent Food but the invoice deceived us","We dinned at this beautiful restaurant based on recommendation given by my hotel at Lake Como. We drove an hour to reach this well located restaurant, and were served by Joanna. The food we tried here was awesome, and the staff was friendly only until the time we got our bill.

This restaurant is frequented by locals, and they don't have many tourists as guests, which is a good thing as you get authentic food, but on the other side they took tourist for a ride with their bill.

The prices in the menu were different from what they charged us in the bill. Example Pizzoccheri was priced at €14 in menu but was charged at €20 in the bill and Rissoto was priced at €18 in the menu but was charged to us at €24. 

We asked what was their soup of the day, and we were told it was Mushroom soup, though a very beautiful soup, since the prices were not in the Menu for the soup, we assumed it would be priced similar to other appetizers in the menu. We were shocked to see €30 for a soup in the invoice.

I would say the food was very good. Given that its a very nice restaurant, good food, we won't have minded paying the prices they charged, but to be fair you cannot charge more than what you put out in your Menu card. 

I did try asking Joanna about the Soup, and she said its because the mushrooms are high quality and hence the cost. For other items I didn't realise till the time I returned home and compared the prices in the bill with the prices on the menu published online on their website.

It was really shocking for us to see a restaurant with such great reputation would act so low.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/08/3e/86/the-kiwi-desert.jpg

It has been always my favourite Italien restaurant for lunch because of the excellent food and service. In this recent visit we went there for diner instead and I was really disappointed.
 Don't know if that has to do because there were only 3 tables for the whole evening. The nice elegant dining room was closed. We were all being sitted at the other side of a very un-cosy room with old fashion green colour wall paper and many old collection radios; with the radio on through out the whole diner. The lighing was really unsupportable.The chair was so uncomfortable, very hard without any cushion. The whole dining atomsphere were all ruined. We both have the Goutmet & Gourmand menu but the food was not as the past standard.
I guess they do more affort for lunch because of people from Switzerland or businese people coming for lunch. Diner is more for the local families who live near by. 
Will give another try again next time but certainly only for lunch only.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/12/cf/26/lanterna-verde.jpg

In my opinion, Lanterna Verde deserves its one star. Solid showing in terms of presentation and flavours, friendly service and nice atmosphere. Next time, I'd probably not go for the gourmet menu, as it seemed to me the focus there is to impress with the expensive ingredients. There seems to be only a menu in Italian, but there was one waitress who spoke English and German.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/53/02/6f/lanterna-verde.jpg

Atmosphere: 4","What a delight! And what a fantastic wine list.","This is what Italy is famous for. From the moment you enter the restaurant (actually, even before, when you make a reservation), you're welcomed so warmly it immediately puts you in a perfect mood.
The ambiance is warm and peaceful, the setting very comfortable, and there is plenty of space around your table not to feel crammed. A fireplace crackling is just the perfect touch. Large tables, wonderful white linens, elegant plates, cutlery and glasses, but yet simple enough to still make you feel at home and comfortable.
The food is so carefully prepared, with fresh and beautiful ingredients, it blows you away. No half measures, the flavors are wonderful. Among other delights, we tasted some of the most outstanding pizzoccheri ever. Both authentic and refined, perfectly balanced. The cuisine in general is very refined, but without losing sight of the authentic flavors it is inspired by. From the perfect home-made fresh bread (absolutely wonderful), all the way through some of the most amazing sorbets, the food is just impeccable.
The wine list is a treasure trove. They have an amazing selection of beautiful Italian wines (and a few French gems), but the prices are so competitive and honest you almost feel guilty. I have rarely seen such a good selection of Barolos and Barbarescos, of the perfect vintages and by the best producers, at such honest prices. A true gem. By the way, they do have the wines that appear on the list: I ordered one of my favorite Barbarescos, and there it came, at perfect cellar temperature, and so well kept the label was perfectly clean. Magnificent Riedel decanter, more than perfect Riedel glasses, impeccable service.
About the service, it could not be better. Attentive and very friendly, but discrete and never overwhelming. The rhythm was perfect, with dishes served gracefully and timely.
If only they got rid of the background music, gentle but not suitable for the perfect atmosphere, they would hit a home run.
Not to be missed, and by the way, if you're on your way to Switzerland, your last chance for a truly wonderful meal before entering the ""land of sad food"".","2","","FAMILY","2014-12-31","2014-12-30","2014-12-30","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r246547132-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

We called to see if they would wait for us, as it was quite late and were kindly directed by the chef himself to the restaurant. The food was excellent! We both had ravioli ripieni di lenticchie, my husband had pernice and I had the carciofo con uovo e tartufo nero. For dessert we had creme brûlée con panettone and fondente di cioccolato - delicious! The service was very attentive - fantastic! They made us feel at home. We found it very fairly priced, especially for a Michelin starred restaurant and located so close to the very expensive Engadin. The interior is very traditional, but it blends appropriately with the region. We would recommend this restaurant.","2","","BUSINESS","2014-02-28","2014-02-24","2014-02-24","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r195236855-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

We started off with a glass of prosecco then had the Goose foie gras with dried figs, onion marmalade and brioche bread which was served with a glass of sauternes, followed that with the local speciality ""Pizzoccheri"" which is buckwheat noodles with cabbage, potatoes and sage butter and stuffed Quail, flavoured with ginger  served with roast sweet peppers and potatoes and finished off with Lime Creme brulèe with peaches and Dark Chocolate Terrine with cherries and mint jelly. 
Every plate was better than the first and we had a wonderful lunch. 
Total €144.50 including wine water and coffee","2","","COUPLES","2013-06-30","2013-07-04","2013-07-04","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r166280729-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"

I had the trout tasting for a starter, followed by the best pizzoccheri I've ever had in my life (better than my father's), then I had the veal cooked in wine which I could cut without using my knife and melted in my mouth. For dessert I had the bavarese with cinnamon, quince, muesli, marron glace and cream of chestnuts> everything was simply delicious.
I loved the deco of the room, high ceilings and walls decorations. 
As we were a group of 14 our menu was chosen earlier (with 2 choices of first course, 2 choices for the second course and a choice of 3 desserts). It cost 53 euro per person, in my opinion very good value for the quality we received.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/12/e8/ca/lanterna-verde.jpg

Atmosphere: 5","A star that always enchants","One of the best starred restaurants in Italy. We returned years later. Then at the helm of the kitchen was the uncle never forgotten, today instead the nephew but the result at the table remained excellent. Class, dedication, technique, elegance are the main ingredients of this starred cuisine, also convenient in value for money, which is rare nowadays. In the dining room, the chef's parents welcome guests and wisely dictate the timing of the service. We chose the four-course Valchiavenna menu (€ 75.00). Very interesting and fun the possibility to compose your own a la carte route by choosing individual courses from the different tasting menus. After the entrée, a delicious potato cream with trout eggs, olive cream, capers and fennel, we started the tasting path with the valley cold cuts with porcini mushroom in oil and dairy butter: bresaola, bacon, coppa and salami, all of excellent choice and quality. As a first course, the famous tajadin dulz de Villa, a kind of maltagliati or rags made from chestnut flour and white flour with cheese and chamomile aroma, well cooked and very tasty. Extraordinary is the second or veal shank cooked in hay brought to the table with the saucepan and of which we are explained the preparation that includes in the final moment even a very short flame with fire to give the dish that incredibly delicate and pleasant touch of smoked. As an accompaniment to the main course, the characteristic rustiment, a kind of pie made with polenta, potatoes, green beans and leek with incredible potato chip spaghetti on top. Well-kept, as indeed all the courses, the dessert: cherries, dark chocolate and fennel sorbet, basically a dark chocolate humus with fresh cherries underneath and ice cream-based cherry balls on top. Generous portions. The wine list is impressive, deep and with honest mark-ups. The arduous choice fell on a refined and structured Inferno della Valtellina Superiore ""La Cruus"" docg of 2018 14.5% of Mamete Prevostini, a pure Nebbiolo (€ 45.00).
Pastries offered: cherry macarons, ugly but good with hazelnut and liquorice and mou candy. Haute cuisine experience and rewarding for a final bill of only € 209.00 (the two four-course Valchiavenna menus, wine, covered € 5.00 and water € 4.00).","0","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-09-20","2024-09-20","en","Lanterna Verde","907762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r970565909-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html"
