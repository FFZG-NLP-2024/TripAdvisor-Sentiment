Order a la carte instead of set","A Michelin starred restaurant serving traditional Taiwanese. We went for their set menu which included a few of their signatures. In general, it fell short of my expectations. The food was of a good quality but it didn't wow, neither in taste nor in food presentation. I did enjoy the Roasted Suckling Pig which was served in 3 ways - crackling skin (1 pc each only), meat and ribs, shredded meat in Gua Bao. The traditional fried bee hoon was delish too, so basic, so simple but yummy, using their local bee hoon that's more bouncy in texture. The dessert was also interesting, first time having grass jelly in pure liquid form instead of the solidified jelly and to have it with crushed peanuts added a different dimension. I was disappointed though that they didn't ask about nut allergy, not that I have it but I expected that of a Michelin star restaurant charging S$160 per pax.

Reservations required and some dishes require advance ordering too.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f2/8d/5a/caption.jpg

I am not a picky person at all. I love street food and high end restaurants. I love food of all kinds, but this place is horrible and for the price I was extremely dissatisfied. Even if it was cheap I would have been disappointed. 

Bad decor, dirty floor, no flavor, very, VERY bland food. 

I never leave reviews, but felt compelled to do so for this restaurant because it’s price and the supposed Michelin star makes it far worse that the food was so bad.

用餐環境真的很優雅，一樓包廂很美，我特別喜歡，適合家庭聚餐，或招待海外友人。復刻台灣菜的擺盤很澎湃，有許多需要事先預訂的菜色，現場有水族箱，挑選喜歡的海鮮，並決定烹飪方式。

餐廳隔壁有露天停車場，附近有大眾交通運輸。

Since the restaurant its location, I've been here three times already. I love the private room on the ground floor. It can seat 14 guests with its own garden (ideal for guests who smoke). It's great for family gathering and friends visiting from overseas. 

Of course it's not cheap. But you get what you pay for, right? Once in awhile it's alright to splurge and indulge! Reservation is a must if you wish to book the private room. The food presentation is very elegant, fitting to go with the ambience. It can serve meat lovers as well as vegetarians. Certain dishes have to be ordered in advance. If you like seafood, there's a live seafood tank where you can choose and pick the ones you like and how you want it to be cooked. 

There's a parking lot next to the restaurant, quite convenient if you travel with seniors and children. Public transportation is also nearby, bus and metro.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/ea/98/59/dining-room.jpg

I do recommend dinning here and would love to come back one day.
For sure not the cheapest restaurant in Taipei but for a few TWD you get so much better food that is worth it.","0","","FRIENDS","2017-01-31","2017-01-02","2017-01-01","en","Mountain and Sea House","6674788","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13808671-d6674788-r448431118-Mountain_and_Sea_House-Zhongshan_District_Taipei.html"

Decor is quaint but the food is really terrible. First of all, they charge NT150 per person for water, not sparkling water, just water, even just hot water. We were only 2 so could not order many dishes. I ordered their abalone (NT 380 for one tiny abalone) which had the stale taste of something that has been kept in the fridge for a while. In any case, the strong peppery taste was totally unsuitable for an abalone. Then came the most horrible dish of a fried ""dumpling"" with oyster and pork stuffing. From the menu, you would have thought that there was one oyster inside the dough but there were literally 2 small pieces of chopped oyster and 1 tiny slither of pork. Most disappointing was the dough which tasted of old flour. We just could not eat the dough it tasted so bad. We had a dish of ""organic"" vegetables so full of fried garlic, you could not taste the freshness of the vegetables. Finally, the dish of fried rice vermicelli tasted so common, any street vendor could have done better and frankly at NT 500, one would have expected more. In addition, we waited for 45 minutes before we had anything to eat. There was no coordination in how the dishes arrived. After the long wait, we were served the vegetables, nothing else. Then it was another 15 minute wait for the fried oyster dumplings, followed by another 10 minute wait for the vermicelli. We were told that since everything was ""freshly"" made, waiting time was long. I do not mind the waiting time if the food was any good but to wait such a long time for bad food was so frustrating when there is such an abundance of excellent food in Taipei for a lot less. The bill came to a bit more than NT 2000 for 2 people for one abalone, one dish of common vegetables, fried rice vermicelli and dumplings with stale tasting dough which we could not eat. Having read all the excellent reviews, I am still wondering what has gone wrong that evening.

大変楽しみにして伺いました。
日本でクレア（雑誌です）をみて台湾の伝統的な食事なんて初めてだとワクワクしていました。
友人宅にお邪魔するような安心感ある門構えで、綺麗に整った庭に南国の木々が異国情緒漂ってました。

食事は創作台湾料理でした。
素材からこだわられているようで、野菜はour farmのものだと教えていただき大変安心していただけました。

こってりヘビーな食事を想像しておりましたが、優しく素材の味を楽しめるものでした。

以下健忘防止のための記載失礼します。

お造り盛り合わせ
日本のお造り盛り合わせと大差ありません。紹興酒漬けの海老のみ中華をいただいてる感がありました

紹興酒
今までいただいた紹興酒の中で一番美味しかったです！ばかばか飲んでも全く酔わず大変芳ばしい上質な香りがしました。メニューに紹興酒もう一種類ありましたが、10倍の値段でした。これよりすごい紹興酒があるのだろうか。。
こちら飲み残した分持って帰らせていただけました。ご親切にグラス二つも付けて下さいました。
どうしても欲しくて百貨店に探しに行きましたが、置いてないとの事。空港でメーカー同じもの発見！連れて帰りました。

八寸
創意工夫が素敵でした。海老の揚げパンやお肉、どれも美味しかったです

ハマグリのスープ
びっくりする位大きなハマグリにハマグリの出汁のよく出たスープ

野菜蒸し
純粋に様々な野菜を楽しめました

大きな伊勢海老
食べ応えありました

カラスミチャーハン
パラパラとして脂っこくなくさらっといただけました

何かのスープ

杏仁豆腐
温かい杏仁豆腐初めていただきました。香を出すため本来杏仁豆腐は温かいものとのこと。
お腹いっぱいなのに無理せずすーっと体に馴染む感じ。

良質なひと時でした。

Service: 2
Food: 1","Faux House","My chef friend took me there with much anticipation as he seldom lets me down.  But what a joke of a place...first sign was the steep prices in a town where great food is very reasonable.  The Royal platter appetizers were highly recommended at NT1900 but I nibbled on a few pieces as most of it awful.  Most of the fat in the plate selection were made of white un-rendered  fat and almost all with no seasoning and flavor.  Some of the supposedly local food inspired creations were 10X street food prices and tasted 10X worse.  The chive turnovers were so freezer burned that is tasted and looked like something you might venture had you not eaten in weeks.  The grouper type fish (they didn't know) on ice (buried in ice actually as no live fish were in the fancy tanks) was suggested steamed but I knew it was going to be bad and if was...flesh was damaged by the ice temp and you can't property steam a fish 120NT/Lian (100g) so $60 fish ruined.   Also the chef likes to put cilantro ruffs on every dish...like bad Chinese restaurants in the US.  Why?  It was even on the steam fish instead of spring onion julienne which traditionally burst with sizzling oil.  There were even basic technical faults like seeds of cucumber in julienne base as they didn't even core out the cucumber.  Service was trained to pretend you are Ina nice villa but no one asked us why we left so much food uneaten.  Also they list a Brunello as a Cab blend...at outrageous prices with no vintages.  Three of us spent 12000NT and that my friend...that is a true rip-off!  Avoid unless you are easily impressed with nice faux villa looks and don't know your food & wine.","0","","FRIENDS","2016-03-31","2016-03-12","2016-03-12","en","Mountain and Sea House","6674788","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13808671-d6674788-r354790413-Mountain_and_Sea_House-Zhongshan_District_Taipei.html"
