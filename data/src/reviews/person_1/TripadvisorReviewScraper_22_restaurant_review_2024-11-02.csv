Exquisite in all dimensions.  Simply the most gracious gentile service one could imagine.  Chef Matsuo is a genius able to adhere to the grand traditions of kai-seki while at the same time adding small wrinkles and surprises.  He has three Michelin stars and Kashiwaya delivers on that promise of excellence.","1","","BUSINESS","2024-05-31","2024-06-04","2024-06-04","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r953760993-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

That is however precisely where this three-star restaurant is located. The philosophy behind it all, just as the fully zen private dining rooms with tatami mats - I assume - is the full and undivided focus should be on the dinner. And: it delivered. The food is season bound and, at times, surprising. While some of the dishes we had were ‘just’ great Japanese food, two of the twelve dishes we had were truly magnificent. 

With respect to the  sake and wine pairing we had; the sake was lovely (as a non-sake expert) and we enjoyed the wine (although other Michelin star restaurants may certainly have better wines).","1","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-16","2024-04-16","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r946927058-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

A lovely lunch in Osaka","We had a wonderful lunch at Kashiwaya.  The service was exceptional from the moment we walked through the door.  We were led to a private room where we were served dish after dish of beautiful and delicious plates in perfect tune with the terroir of the Osaka region.  

The menu follows traditional Kaiseki format and our servers kindly explained the significance of the different components in each dish as it relates to the current season.  We made our reservation on the MyConcierge website (my first time doing this) and everything went very smoothly.  We have eaten at several 3 star Kaiseki restaurants and this ranks highly among them.  Definitely worth the detour!!!","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/e9/c7/32/caption.jpg

Food: 5","Fabulous","I have developed the theory that very good restaurants are frequently divisive. There will be many diners that love a good restaurant and leave glowing reviews. Others will simply not like the concept and, having potentially paid a very great deal of money for an experience that did not hit the spot, will leave poor reviews. Looking at a couple of recent reviews for Kashiwaya, it seems that this is the case here.

For my part, this is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten in. As my son said, it would almost be worth the journey from London to Osaka simply to visit this restaurant. It is expensive but, equally, you get what you pay for.

As far as I could see, the restaurant comprises a collection of private dining rooms and we were shown to a delightful space upstairs. Decoration is traditional Japanese with cloth covered walls and a tatami mat floor. The table was close to the floor but was placed over a pit (for want of a better expression ) into which your legs went, so that you could sit very comfortably on the floor.

The service is superb with an amazing sense of ceremony. Each time we were visited, typically by two or three of the staff, the door was slid open and they bowed outside before making their way to the table to serve us. Two of the staff members spoke a fair to good level of English and were perfectly well able to explain the various different courses and sake.

The food is exceptional and fully deserving of three Michelin stars. Inevitably I enjoyed some course more than others but all were good. I especially like the 'moon' theme than ran through the dinner and inspired many of the courses.","3","","NONE","2019-09-30","2019-09-22","2019-09-22","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r711835114-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

So I expected some surprising tastes and textures but it was a disappointment.  The food didn't worth a detour nor flying to dine here. The food tasted just like it looked. I mean raw fish tastes like raw fish but I expected them to do something with the ingredients and turned out to be something unexpected in terms  of flavors and textures. They tried to serve the best seasonal ingredients using Japanese cooking. No offense but you can imagine authentic Japanese cooking, which tend not to add much flavor to ingredients resulting in very mild flavor food, which I could have it elsewhere in Kyoto. I expected more than this from 3 stars Michelin and I know what kind restaurants to look for now. I love to be excited and surprised. 

So if you want an above average authentic Japanese restaurant, this restaurant maybe for you but if you  are looking for something surprising, it's not for you. The decorations were like small old Japanese room and 2 small tables, which could only fit 2 persons and it was a little bit uncomfortable for me but I like how it's a private room. Also it's about 4,200 yen taxi drive from Namba.

The dish I enjoyed the most was in the attachments. It's called Mizumono - Fruit balls with honey jelly. It was a very fun dish with different flavors of peeled fruit balls.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/9f/ff/24/kashiwaya.jpg","COUPLES","2019-05-31","2019-05-22","2019-05-22","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r675650495-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

I’m really bummed to have to write this review... On paper, 3 Michelin Stars, Relais Chateaux, $400 per person... It sounded like the meal of a lifetime, right? NOT. The restaurant has many rooms, most of which are tatami floor seating style. We were led to what looked like an interrogation room with a table large enough for 10 people, 2 Western chairs, no artwork on the walls and dated decor. Not even old charm Japanese, just old and frankly creepy. No music and the incessant sliding door opening and closing with a rusted metallic sound... We were totally creeped out. We had to start playing a little background music from our phones to get a some kind of atmosphere. Rude of us? Maybe, but I swear, the room had this awful fluorescent lighting, not at all the “cocoon feel” I had read about in the reviews. 
THE FOOD: just plain boring. No flavors, nothing exciting at all. Is the Chef so well known that he keeps getting the ratings he received 20 years ago? 
The sake/wine tasting at $90 per person consisted of $12 bottles anyone could find at the corner supermarket. Not good at all. 
Service was lovely. Therefore my giving the place 2 stars. 

We walked out of there, thanked everyone politely and burst into laughter once in the taxi. Never have I spent $900 on a meal for 2 that was so below average. Not to mention the restaurant is a 45 minute drive from the center of Osaka. 

SO DISAPPOINTING. ","4","","COUPLES","2018-10-31","2018-10-17","2018-10-17","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r625916261-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Food: 5","""you will experience a harmonious culinary meditation appealing to almost all the senses""","in other words, this will be one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat. why? let me count the ways:

(1) the peaceful setting in a traditional tatami mat room (with a seat and room for legs below the just-above-floor-level table, for the less flexible or more long-legged among us) in a traditional house incongruously next to a freeway in an otherwise quiet mid-north osaka neighbourhood.

(2) the gracious and welcoming greeting on arrival - and, depending on how busy they are, possibly even from grand chef hideaki matsuo and/or his wife proprietress katsuko matsuo.

(3) the unobtrusive, professional yet empathetic service throughout the time at kashiwaya - in our case, for all four hours of our visit.

(4) and, of course, that ""harmonious culinary meditation"" befitting of a restaurant with those coveted three michelin stars...all 12 courses so beautifully designed for the eye, so carefully prepared for the fragrance and flavour and texture. 

we were fortunate enough to have visits from the head chef and proprietress during our meal. they kindly explained the back stories involved in choosing the food items and combinations, the preparation and presentation - and the relationship with topics ranging from historical  traditions to the season and even the day's weather.

in the TripAdvisor article i wrote following a visit a year ago i explained more about the back stories and a little bit about the head chef's relationship with food when he's not at the restaurant, so i won't repeat those details here (like his favourite food, and what he does if he's invited out for a meal which wasn't as good as it might have been). 

in the attached photo montages of our lunch, i've included the menu we enjoyed - ""Aotsuyu - rain dropping among leaves"" and indeed it was lightly raining that day. 

this was only my second three-michelin-star restaurant experience (the other was in paris). but it certainly was an experience to savour, in all senses of the word.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/0b/1c/36/gourmet-dining-on-12.jpg

I called the restaurant first and luckily they did not cancel our booking. We were well received when arrived and led to a big room. I was surprised as there was only two of us. We were served by 2 waitresses and one of them explained the ingredients of every dish. It was so peaceful in the room and we could not hear any noise outside. The course we chosen was named “Spring morning”. The food was nicely placed on utensils which became pieces of beautiful artwork.  I must mention the  wine pairing. It was a surprise that red wine was also on the list yet a terrific match with Japanese food. My only comment is that if I were a vegetarian, the food was unbeatable. So, if some meat could be added in the course, that would be perfect.","0","","FRIENDS","2018-04-30","2018-04-22","2018-04-22","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r574908703-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

Food: 5","Brilliant and exotic three star Michelin restaurant","Three star restaurants in Japan are always surprising. Either they are chock full of molecular experiments and nordic inspiration (from Noma), or they are very close to something like the traditional Keiseki. This is clearly in the latter category. Al guest are given private rooms, and all are served a set menu consisting of 12-14 courses. A drinking pairing consisting mostly of top notch sake is highly recommended. Tables are traditional in the low style, but there is room for legs underneath, so have no fear of sitting straight on the floor. The food is served at a calm pace, brought by three waiters in traditional dresses. Food is traditional, praising the spring and cherry blossoming when we were there, but with some interesting twists. The whole seance takes almost three hours, but gee how fast time passes. At 90000 + yen for two persons, it is not exactly cheap, but this is not the place to visit if you are on a tight budget. However, if you are interested in how fascinating traditional japanese food can be, this is really a place to book.","0","","COUPLES","2018-03-31","2018-04-04","2018-04-03","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r570927266-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

A phone call confirmed that the phone had been found, and next thing I knew, the proprietress, Mrs. Matsuo, was on her way by train from Osaka to Kyoto to deliver the phone to my hotel.  I did not even have a chance to thank her when she arrived around midnight, bearing also a gift of chirimenjako from the restaurant, as she left immediately to take the train back.  I may forget my phone again, but I will never forget this amazing service.

The food was of course excellent, but I would like to point out the unusual offer of a matching menu of various sake and two wines.  Every one of these choices was a delight, and the opportunity to sample such a diversity of sake should not be passed up.

So hearing the backstory about a restaurant and its food can really enhance the dining experience.
Hideaki Matsuo, 53, Proprietor and Grand Chef, and his wife Katsuko, Proprietress, earned their third Michelin star in 2011. They opened a sister restaurant in Hong Kong in 2015 and by last year it had already received its first Michelin star.
One of the signature dishes is “fluffy” melt-in-your-mouth lobster. Chef Matsuo uses the shell in the broth and steams it for a long time. It took him six hours to come up with this dish, from inspiration to completion. 
He develops dishes according to the seasons and also tradition. For example, with the approach of a hot summer, in old times the Japanese emperor gave away ice to his subjects to beat the summer heat and wish them good health. So when summer approaches Kashiwaya serves dishes that reflect this tradition with, for example, the appearance of ice.
Unsurprisingly Matsuo is both head chef at the restaurant and also head chef at home, where he likes to prepare everyday food that’s quick and easy to cook. 
He often chooses dishes his mother made – and takes photos of them to send her to show he still cooks what she made for the family. His favourite food? Fried prawns. 
When friends invite the couple for a meal, even if it’s basic food what matters to them are the fresh ingredients and preparation, the intention to provide a good meal. Even if the food happens to be bad, Matsuo said he has been taught never to leave anything on the plate.
At Kashiwaya, guests also never leave anything on their plates. But for all the right reasons.","0","","COUPLES","2017-05-31","2017-07-28","2017-07-28","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r506612572-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

You will have a stylish and traditional Japanese room to yourself , even if you are on your own .

The hospitality one receives right at the start indicates probably something special is coming . And there it appears , a few minutes later . The smiles and courtesy of the few Japanese girls serving you are unbeatable.

The first course will melt you already , not quite because of the taste , texture and material used , but also due to the artistic presentation .

What comes afterwards convince you that Michelin doesn't give 3 stars easily and your taste buds and eyes are constantly entertained to the utmost .

A dish with jelly and shrimps inside was actually outshone by the arrangement and the color of the food as well as the design of the ceramics . The whole presentation glows and one keeps on wondering how so much time and effort have been spent on just one dish . 

The overall price ( without counting the sake ) is around Yen 25000, a most reasonable amount when one considers that the ambience , service , food , arrangement and effort put into the show are superb .

I must say : the food is not good , as it is excellent !

From the moment you enter, the service is impeccable.
The food is such a great Japanese experience, and we certainly tried some things we normally wouldn't! Each dish had a story, and you could see how much thought and effort went into preparing them.
The hostess tried her best to explain everything to us in English, which was greatly appreciated and not at all expected. She was absolutely lovely. 
After trying several types of sake throughout our trip, our favourite was here. It is made specially for the restaurant, and it was really pleasant.
Overall, if you're looking for an affordable Michelin experience (we went for lunch), then Kashiwaya will certainly please you.","0","","COUPLES","2017-02-28","2017-05-03","2017-05-02","en","Kashiwaya","9621651","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r481143575-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html"

One restaurant that is a prime example of this cuisine is Kashiwaya. Kashiwaya offers modern kaiseki which  refers to a seasonal multi-course meal, featuring labour-intensive preparations incorporating premium ingredients.

The eatery has been awarded three Michelin stars for the last few years.Everything is perfectly exquisite at Kashiwaya. The prestigious ingredients, sublime preparation and incredible plating provide a gastronomical experience that’s almost poetic. You pay heavily, but it’s worth every cent.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/a5/98/7b/main-door.jpg
