1,1.1,I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars.,"I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars.  Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive.  When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.  I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars.

5,5.1,A complicated menu with some of the offerings not available.,"A complicated menu with some of the offerings not available. The place is extremely overpriced for what they offer - olives soaked in olive oil with a weak ""citrus"" condiment; oysters on the half shell with possibly the most boring sauce ever (green mamão vinagrete), raviolis no better than anything you'd get at Eataly, meat you could do yourself at home, pork with lots of fat in it - the Chef's ego is bigger than his creations. I will never return, service was weak and they suggested 14% when standard tips in São Paulo are 10%. Impossible to rate this experience above average and if you reserve and don't show up, he'll charge you. There are literally hundreds of better places in the city.

76,76.1,Yesterday night I had my first dinner at restaurant Flore and it was amazing.,"Yesterday night I had my first dinner at restaurant Flore and it was amazing. We had the Omnivore menu with the seasonal wine pairing. It was an extraordinary gastronomic journey, beginning with four amuse bouche where I fell in love with the fried oyster in miso, then we continued with seven dishes where colours and flavours  combined like magic. The main course was the lamb, it was very juicy and extremely tender. We had the opportunity to taste this dish inside the kitchen at the chef’s table and it was great seeing the chef’s team at work. The dinner closed with an amazing dessert, that combined tomatoes with raspberry, and with the friandise. Everything was perfect.

89,89.1,We had a great time at Essigbratlein while visiting Nuremberg.,"We had a great time at Essigbratlein while visiting Nuremberg. The meal was truly an experience where each dish was interesting and unique in its own way. We have been to two 1 Michelin star restaurants in the past, but this was our first 2 Michelin star restaurant and it did not disappoint. Many of the dishes are vegetarian, but they are just as delicious as the meat dishes. There was also an optional wine pairing for each course if you wish. We were served 13 courses, including the amuse bouches that preceded the main courses.

92,92.8,THANK YOU!,"Team Atelier Crenn really knows fine dining, creative/tasty food, exceptional service, and wine pairings. I’m equally impressed now as I was when I  first visited 18 months ago. Such freshness, such bold flavors, such creativity!  Seafood and Vegetables were the stars of the meal with the “cherry bomb,” the carrot and pea taco, the cauliflower and caviar,  and the beets and leche de tigre the standouts. The dry aged black cod with sides was superb. The restaurant’s redesign for 2023 gave it an airy and light feel.

116,116.12,Highly recommended.,"I went to Amber with a friend 2 days ago and we both thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.   The tasting menu featured some very fresh and high quality ingredients. While all savoury dishes were very delicious, the following were particularly memorable:  1. the iconic Aka Uni dish  2. Normandy scallop with winter truffle which we had in the kitchen  3. French lamb which comprised 3 different parts. The meat was perfectly cooked. It’s very tender and juicy with a unique fragrance.   The dessert wasn’t bad. But I’m kind of old-school and would have preferred some traditional or classic French pastry dessert.   As always, the service was impeccable. All the staff were professional, knowledgeable and courteous.   Highly recommended.",116,331,584,2024-02-26,Egon70,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r939881319-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,4,en,Positive (0.9993)
