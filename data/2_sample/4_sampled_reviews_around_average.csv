1,166,"I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars.  Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive.  When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.  I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars.  I can't recommend this place unless you're rich and cost doesn't matter much to you.",494,2023-08-12,Connor M,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r909829411-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,2,en
2,1090," We had a very good dinner, however not one star experience (this is why rated it with 3).  The chef offer at the beginning was with neutral taste,  Best plate from the entree is the egg with black truffe (highly recommended).  The bread was very good and the same was the beef as main plate (very good grilled with a delicious sauce). Good selection of wines and the ones we were served with the menu were really good, especially the white one (Riesling Alcase 2016).   The cheese at the end was average. as it was grated cheese, where the taste was lost.  Good service.  Priced as 1star, Yet not at this level.

All of the service staff were friendly and professional. The courses were very pleasing to the eye and a sensation on the palate. Several courses were served as two separate dishes. The sommelier remembered comments and altered the following wines accordlingly. We arrived at 6:30 pm and left after 11 pm. An amazing evening from start to finish. Definitely a luxury, but for a special occasion well worth it.

4,1156,"Amazing one- star food based on Norwegian products!! We strongly recommend it if you’re visiting Oslo and you want to celebrate something special :)   The prices of the food menu are reasonable comparing to any other restaurant in Oslo with normal food…the prices only double those, but Kontrast quality is much better than double :) (just to say something, the drinks prices are quite high, as in every Michelin restaurant)  The place is super nice, you feel really comfortable and the service is excellent!

5,395,"A complicated menu with some of the offerings not available. The place is extremely overpriced for what they offer - olives soaked in olive oil with a weak ""citrus"" condiment; oysters on the half shell with possibly the most boring sauce ever (green mamão vinagrete), raviolis no better than anything you'd get at Eataly, meat you could do yourself at home, pork with lots of fat in it - the Chef's ego is bigger than his creations. I will never return, service was weak and they suggested 14% when standard tips in São Paulo are 10%. Impossible to rate this experience above average and if you reserve and don't show up, he'll charge you. There are literally hundreds of better places in the city.

On the other, the waitress is good and the chef or people working at the kitchen is excellent as well, but the waiter is a little bit rude, because when I ask can I change my seat they directly answer me such as NO,emmm they should say I deeply understand the reason you want to change the seat, but unfortunately, it has been done at the moment and the new lamp is on the way,because we ordered it a few days ago,but next time when you come I will arrange a best seat for you.

The food generally good but not exceptional.  The desert offer was poor. Whats annoyed us was having chosen an award winning red Mozaik wine , we were told that it was full of tanens and the "" somelier"" suggested something else and of course at a high price.  We thought the wine list was good but seriously over priced.  We also decided to buy at the Mozaik wineyard and try the Mozaik wine we wanted to drink. There were no tanens in this 2012 beauty ?!

While there are a couple meat  dishes, out of the seven courses, all was very enjoyable. My son (teenager) is not a fan of vegetables, but loved every vegetable dish. If you’re looking for meat in every dish, based on the one night we dined here, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a diverse meal this should be a must.

Some of the dishes (like cabbage we gave up on finishing) is simply hard to cut and share, leave alone the opportunity to dine with someone who is not your close family or couple.

The freshness of the herbs, leaves, fruits, and vegetables made them the star of the meal. Such great combinations and delicious flavor. The river trout was local and just seemed to make sense in this beautiful mountain setting. The carrot ice cream was a game changer and I was searching for recipes right after we left the restaurant.

It’s just pure magic! We enjoyed everything, from the appetizers to the dessert. What can be improved though is the service: in a 2-stars restaurant you expect definitely more attention to the guest (from the type of water You drink to the kindness of waiters)…definitely what you do not expect is having a waitress telling you that you cannot go to the restroom if then the next course comes 15 minutes later!… But again, the food is worth the whole experience!",629,2023-07-03,Fiorenza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r900027982-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,5,en

The quality of ingredients and cooking are worthy of 3 stars, justifying the high prices (all-but-raw lobster in a disarmingly expansively flavoured ocean of greenery being the star of the evening). And yet here we find none of the preciousness required of higher instellation: just a friendly understated sophistication of honesty. And (surprising though it may seem by reference to the carte) generosity.

99,449,"I wrote a very lengthy review to explain why the meal was very disappointing, bar maybe two dishes (the celeriac / truffle pasta and the dessert). They requested TA to take it down (don't like criticism?). But people should know this restaurant is in fact quite disappointing: 1) the chefs seems to care more about how nice the dishes look and how many different flavours he can cram, rather than actual test. 2) we were overcharged for a bottle of wine rather than a glass - this was corrected after we noticed but not even an apology. 3) after dinner we were completely neglected, couldn't even get a cab for us.

I easily had one of the best meals of my life here and was so delighted that I booked here for my birthday. The service was warm, friendly, attentive and joyful.

We recently went back and had another over-the-top amazing meal and evening at Aponem. This time we started with a cocktail that Gaby created based on a few ideas of things we like, and it was a sign of the many more good things to come from the Aponem team. The entire meal was incredible, from a dizzying spread of appetizers, to magical main courses, and desserts that were as delicious as they were beautiful.

The sophisticated ambience as you enter the dinning room following your seat in the “waiting room” sets a high standard for the food to meet, it does and then some.  Quality of service is second to none and the tasting menu is a delight to behold, an example being the salad course which is a picture on your plate then to be told there are fifty different items on your plate and here is a list of the items.

But most important you can not have a group of way too loud guests in a ""star"" restaurant because everybody else is suffering.  If they want to be a wine-tasting bar they have it all. Nice wines, great views, and professional staff. They just need to drop a tasting menu and prepare a few local dishes that would work perfectly with wine tasting.

The bread although baked once we had sat at the table and obviously totally fresh was tastless.  The concept of the dinning experience is freshness and the decor is lovely.  The freshness part is superb, but they just don't have equally high quality food.  The desert was strawberries on top of a cream with cheese mix, tasty but nothing extraordinary at all.

Atmosphere and design as well pretty nice.  Prices for sparkling wine and corresponding wine pairing on the other hand are a rip-off. Charging 20 EUR for a glass of Karanika which can be bought for 18 EUR a bottle in a shop is not acceptable. You are getting glasses of champagne in other restaurants for this price. The so called premium wine pairing for 135 EUR each person has been underwhelming.  Not a single bottle of these wines is charged more than 20 EUR in a shop.

He seems to be a chef who stays away from gimmicks and technical tricks and tries to win over the guest with a unique approach that is difficult to put into words.

The high-quality ingredients that he certainly uses reflect a close affinity with Switzerland. Bold and full of contrast, honest and accessible - this is the kind of food you would like to come across more often!
