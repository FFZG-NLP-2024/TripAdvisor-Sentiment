2024-10-21,Jennifer P,Cool atmosphere and a few “cool” dishes but if you have a big appetite you probably leave hungry  and when they say 50 dishes they mean 50 bites… totally overrated and at the end tiresome. You just want it to be over. Definitely not worth the money…the performance received could never match the investment.

2024-08-11,RorschAch,"Alchemist is one of the most unique restaurants in the history of Michelin restaurants in the world. It was founded by chef Rasmus Munk in 2015. In 2016, Lars Seier Christensen (co-founded Saxo Bank, resigned in 2016), an investor of the three-Michelin restaurant Geranium in Copenhagen, approached Rasmus Munk, hoping to take the restaurant ""Alchemist"" to a new level and decided to create an unprecedented restaurant experience. Alchemist 2.0 opened on July 4, 2019. In just a few years, this two-Michelin-star restaurant led by chef Rasmus Munk was ranked 18 (2022), 5 (2023), and 8 (2024) on the Best 50 list, and was called the most immersive restaurant ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r964245588-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en

2024-07-29,TheYoungRetiredCouple,"Wow.... We have wanted to dine at the Alchemist for years.  Without doubt the best restaurant meal I have eaten in my life.  From the moment your arrive at this Copenhagen dockside warehouse, and enter the restaurant lobby, it is a sensory overload of the best sort.  It's not cheap, but at the same time represents amazing good value for money. It is like going out to dinner and visiting the theatre, art gallery, school and the movies at the same time.  You eat the best food. Very cleverly and creatively cooked by the super talented Rasmus Munk and team. The original presentation and ideas make you think and you learn. It really is, very, very clever. Perhaps unique.   The fact that the service is superb, authentic and unstuffy helps make this the ultimate fine dinning experience.  Other than having the patience required to wait to get a rare table reservation, there is no downside. The Alchemist is the best fine dinning experience ever.  We loved it. Every foodie should go at least once.  We will return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r962280245-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en

To start with we arrived there earlier and they managed to get us in earlier, even offered a poncho - as I was cold - in case we would have waited. Needless to say it’s certainly kicked off our experience in a great way. The entry room took us by surprise in a fantastic way and managed to get us in the mood even more. We wanted to try the bunny ears cocktail, which we did and highly recommended then the magic of the food started flowing. Me and my partner went there with very open mind, which is needed to fully understand and appreciate the amazing work what Rasmus and his team does. Every single dish was on an other level, what we both have ever tasted even if there was one or two more challenging dishes. Service was exceptional throughout the evening and all of their knowledge of the food and beverage. Our host, Hannah was very professional with a cracking sense of humor. All of the team member has such a great character, which we were both pleased to see. Booking a table can be stressful as tickets are gone within a very short time but certainly worth to go through the nerve wracking time till you managed to be quick enough to reserve a spot :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d8547060-r948029549-Alchemist-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en

2023-09-06,Dan,"I had high hopes for our dinner at Alchemist. It definitely started strong. At the middle of the dinner, I thought to myself: wow, this is the best restaurant in the world. The food was delicious, the wine list incredible, and the décor spectacular. Yet, after an hour, we received odd dishes. Including: lamb’s brain, jelly fish, pigs windpipe, ice cream made with pig’s blood. I was sick the next day.  What is the purpose of serving those ingredients? I enjoyed the beginning of the meal but at the end I felt abused and sick to my stomach.   Alchemist could have been the best restaurant in the world. It is spectacular, with exceptional service and superb gastronomic capabilities. It just needs to let go of the exotic ingredients. It can shift from being one of the worst restaurants in the world to one of the best with just minor changes.   We left the restaurant traumatized. We felt as if we were the chef's guinea pigs.

2023-07-05,Jeff K,"My wife and I had dinner with wine pairings at Alchemist on a Tuesday.  Our dinner lasted about 5 hours and consisted of 30 separate dishes plus 2 special drinks.  I agree with the many other reviews that the food and the overall experience at Alchemist is outstanding.    We must have interacted with 15-20 different servers. Service was impeccable and very friendly.   I was surprised to learn that you only eat in three rooms - I was expecting more.  Appetizers are served in the bar where you can order a cocktail.  Dinner is served in the main dining room where everyone sits at one very large counter.  You then have desserts and coffee in a third room.  We ordered the wine pairings partly because I thought we would be changing rooms frequently. With hindsight, we should have ordered a bottle and/or glasses of wine.  The pairings were excellent but we’re not wine aficionados and we could have saved a lot of money.  We had a reservation for 7:00 which turned out to be rather late as most guests had arrived before us.  (The restaurant opens at 5:00.)  If I get the chance to return I will book earlier.  I was told that a 4 person reservation is the easiest to get and a 6 person is the hardest.  Also, the sommeliers table is not a separate table - you sit at the counter like everyone else but enjoy their top-of-the-line wine service.  We stopped at Mikkelker Baghaven prior to dinner. It’s about a 5-minute walk to the Alchemist and is a good pre-dinner option.

2024-11-05,LoveTheWorld,The food and service at Essigbratlein is brilliant and should not be missed if visiting Nuremberg.  Each dish was fresh and appealing.  The hotel director at the Drei Raben where we stayed discovered we were dining at Essigbratlein and he was extremely enthusiastic telling us how the vegetables would “explode” with deliciousness and exquisite flavors.   He was totally accurate!  This restaurant was one of the highlights of our dining experiences on a long road trip through Austria and Germany.  It would be our top pick to return and experience again.  The wine pairing was also wonderful and my partner who doesn’t care for alcohol loved the non-alcoholic beverage pairing.  I believe our dining experience lasted about 4 hours and we loved every minute.  Vielen Dank!

2021-12-15,SeanSky,"In Nuremberg on business and decided to go all-in for the best possible dinner experience.  If you have dined somewhere like Alinea (Chicago, IL), you know what fine dining can be -- Essigbraetien has earned its stars and deserves three!  From the moment you enter, you are treated as the only guests.  Trust the front of house and the kitchen staff to leave you feeling ""blown away"".  If you are an enophile, definitely include the wine pairing - selections from their cellar are perfectly matched with each course - and you will not find these wines in a retail store.  Very intimate setting but still appropriate for a business dinner for two.  Worth every euro and every moment spent dining with this team!  Frankly, this restaurant is the one reason to travel to Germany!  To the restaurant - please forgive that my review is in English.  But, language was no barrier to an amazing evening.

2018-07-09,iloveeshly,"We dine for the past 10 years all over the world in the best restaurant as part of our job to cater to our high class clients. I personally adore vegetables and bland food. My partner is a vegetarian. We both eat tiny portions, but I felt like I've been given literally one slice of leek over the whole evening. Luckily I went for the 7 course menu that included a hip of lamb, so I wasn't going home completely starved as my girlfriend did who went for the 4 course meal instead. I wasn't asked how I like the meat, it was bloody medium rare. It was tender but nothing spectacular. Just a good piece of lamb, chewy tho and hard to cut without a steak knife. It was still the highlight of my dinner that gave me some filling satisfaction. We both love healthy, regional organic food- but the price is just ridiculously high for what it is-  Poor people food (leeks, celery, onion)  Delicious, but for that price I'm expecting lobster, Beluga Caviar,  Wagyu Beef and Champagne. We payed 400 Dollar for 2, only had 2 regional glasses of wine and came home hungry. Yes, the dishes were super cute presented in extremely tiny portions and beautifully arranged but nothing spectacular out of this world that's new or not seen before.  The windows were open the whole evening, attracting lots of flies into the glasses of water and wine. Maybe a net over the open window would be useful. We give the one star for the excellent service, that was really spectacular. You can tell the servants are highly trained and skilled. The door was held open, the napkin was replaced when falling on the floor immediately and the staff spoke perfect English. It was also great to see the chef comming to the tables. We only give one star in total because the price in comparison to what is offered is really not appropriate. Complimentary choclate chunks are given at the end which is really nice, but now I feel a bit sick eating all of them because of the hunger, smaller choclate would match the tiny menu. A note about holding a conversation down in this small formal room would be good with the mostly American visitors that evening talking  so loudly we knew all about their private business at the end of the evening. My partner is American and felt offended by their loud conversations. We missed some kind of gentle music. Unfortunately live music in not cherished anywhere when it gives such a great atmosphere. We expected to be blown away but we are quite surprised of what people think is unique and out of this world.....To us it's everyday healthy food that should be served in bigger portion for cheaper. We would be eating there daily. But with literally one leek on the plate you can't go home satisfied. We haven't regret going there tho, we had a great evening. We would not go back. Thank you for the great attentive and professional table service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r594762405-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,1,en
2018-06-25,Brian Randall,"Having dined in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years, this year our visit was to Nuremberg and consequently Essigbratlein. Possibly rather more quaint than other starred restaurants we had visited, from ringing the bell to enter to the internal décor. As one would expect, service was impeccable but pleasantly jovial. Now for the difference, that lies in the unusual style of food, from the many amuse bouches to the clever and possibly unique use of vegetables. The menu I shall be posting with this review has lost a great deal in translation and is over simplified beyond belief. As always, we chose to drink the paired wines and had the privilege of tasting some superb well matched wines with our unusual meal. Overall, it was a very pleasant meal in a quaint restaurant, but would we go again, probably not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r590502512-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,4,en

2024-06-05,Olivier B,"Pros:  	1.	Peaceful Setting: Toya is located in a serene and picturesque area, right on the border of a golf course and adjacent to a small hotel. The tranquil surroundings make for a relaxing dining experience. 	2.	Popularity: Despite visiting on a weekday at lunchtime, the restaurant was full, indicating its popularity and strong reputation. 	3.	Excellent Service: From start to finish, the service level was outstanding. The staff were attentive and professional, enhancing the overall dining experience. 	4.	Unique Menu Concept: The restaurant offers “surprise” menus where you select the number of courses, and the Chef and his team prepare dishes based on the freshest available ingredients. This adds an element of excitement and ensures a unique dining experience each time. 	5.	Extensive Wine List: Toya boasts a large wine list and offers a wine pairing option with the menus, which can enhance the culinary experience. The sommelier’s house cocktail, featuring blueberry liqueur and pine spirit, is a delightful addition to the drink offerings.  Cons:  	1.	Isolated Location: The restaurant is somewhat isolated, situated near the small city of Faulquemont. A vehicle is necessary to get there, which might be inconvenient for some guests. 	2.	Language Barrier: While the service was excellent, the staff’s limited proficiency in English might pose a challenge for foreign guests. It’s advisable to have some knowledge of French or be prepared for some communication difficulties.  Overall: Toya offers an excellent dining experience with its peaceful setting, exceptional service, and unique menu concept. Despite the need for a vehicle to reach the somewhat isolated location and the potential language barrier, it is definitely worth a visit for a memorable meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r953889964-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html,5,en

2016-05-15,gottmeinwasist,"Apparently I will be the first less-than-rave english language review but I do see some in the French language. On the surface, the restaurant presents a welcoming clean design with a very friendly professional staff. I speak very highly of the staff. The dishes were plated extremely well, utilising earthy designs with rocks, ""slice"" of tree trunks etc.   The actual food, however, was a let-down. I am still waiting for at least one ""wow"" dish. Several of the small bite-sized amuse bouche and desserts were sitting in tartlet shells which I believe were purchased, since they were perfectly symmetric and bland.  One of the fish dishes (raw sea bass) was completely flavourless and a strange texture. I still cannot believe the asparagus...a surprisingly cold barely blanched spear of white asparagus wrapped in ""something"" accompanied by a chunk of warm asparagus...it did LOOK exciting with a Jackson-Pollock like appearance. And, I am amused reading one of the reviews which also mentions the rock-hard chunks of turnip...what was that supposed to be? Nothing really offered any spark of flavor or excitement. This was very disappointing in a Michelin-starred restaurant.  Sure, some cooking techniques were showcased, but I can make a foam too!  At the end, I realized that the chef was maybe trying too hard to incorporate some Japanese/Asian influences...most clearly seen in the ice cream with saki poured over it. (which was served in a small shot glass that didn't accommodate the spoon which came with it---details).   In the end...disappointment in every dish. Not one was something I really enjoyed. No, wait...the chef apparently makes his own butter which was superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1927317-d1906797-r373154777-Toya-Faulquemont_Moselle_Grand_Est.html,3,en

He is present with all simplicity among his guests, as are the wise members of the staff. The explanation of each dish, starting with the fresh water from the garden and the appetizers which promise the rest of the meal, tantalize our taste buds by announcing gustatory delights! The Chef works with local products, starting from his garden for vegetables, including bread with wheat and rye from the farm next door, accompanied by delicious butter from Jersey cows (killer!!). I have not forgotten the snail cromesquis from Thionville, the arctic char from the Heimbach source, the lamb from Beux, reminding us that our Lorraine Alsace region is rich in quality products and passionate producers. The salmon, with colonnata bacon with its poultry juice and whey emulsion is not left out in this symphony of explosion of flavors, sometimes spicy, sometimes sweet, but always subtle. And the desserts, ah the desserts!! We would never have dared to imagine that the marriage of parsnips, chicory and cereals could give us such delight, just like working with honey from the Chef's own hives! This delicious delight ended with succulent treats and especially the little birthday cakes, a gesture much appreciated on our part.

Applied service, which features the culinary score of a Chef who perfectly masters his subject, playing with tastes, textures and consistencies with precision. This cuisine is cooked with products of impeccable rigor and gives pride of place to regional producers. How pleasant it is to deal with a passionate, competent and affable sommelier. Its selected wines hit the mark, such as this Altesse varietal Savoie wine served as an aperitif which immediately opens your palate. A few dices of Foie Gras, a shredded lobster coral crepe drizzled with an aromatic chicken stock as desired, celestine-like Consommé, crunchy cabbage with sweet Munster cheese and onions, homemade black pudding fritter and fruit apples, tartlet around radish in snacks quickly set the tone. All this presented and explained by the Chef himself. What more can I say that the arctic char from the source of the Heimbach stream goes like a letter in the post, that the wild salmon in poultry juice with supple flesh and subtle flavor was just cooked or just cooked, that the beef of the Jersiaire breed, from the breeding of the Belles Roses farm, is of unparalleled tenderness, all accompanied by homemade bread, but not just any bread!! Sourdough, wheat and rye flour from the farm next door: the kind of bread you would want to take for breakfast the next day: a real treat. The only downside in this score is that the sauce is as smooth as can be but strong in the mouth, perhaps due to an overdose of horseradish...shhhh!!!

We made a last-minute switch to the Chef's Table experience, enjoying a 16-course meal with wine pairing, and it was an unforgettable experience. Each dish was a masterpiece, with complex, well-balanced flavors that highlighted herbs from their garden. There wasn’t a single dish we didn’t love.

There is a warmth throughout which came in lots of ways; walking past the kitchen and meeting the brigades on the way to being seated, the booklet of herbs grown in the garden and the personalised menu to take home with a bunch of herbs. All of these things elevate the experience but ultimately, the food has to deliver - to that extent, it did! The taster menu was as clever as it was enjoyable to eat!  The Lobster and amberjack were particular highs with a mention going to the caramel dish too!  The food and execution of concept with the overall experience points this to targeting two stars justifiably. Service needs to tighten up though.

2024-03-16,dippydax,"We have visited many great restaurants over the world, Michelin starred, recommended locals, and hidden gems as we’re always wanting to seek out new experiences. We visited Soil as we were in Athens celebrating a big birthday and thought we’d try something with a good ethos and go the whole hog with the wine pairing as well. On first impressions we were a bit surprised by the atmosphere. Whilst the staff were really nice it just felt a bit stifled and perfunctory. We’ve become accustomed to a more relaxed Michelin experience as times have moved on from the starched white linen and table scrapers, and whilst there wasn’t a scraper in sight, the service itself felt the same which was a strange juxtaposition. We were a late sitting and were whizzed through 14 canapé sized bites. It was a bit of a whirlwind so was probably lucky the wine pairing had such small tastings. Apart from some of them, we weren’t sure the pairings lent themselves well to the food or vice versa. The majority of dishes also had high levels of acidity, which for us led to that being the dominating flavour profile. In the bread course, we had one with the provided acidity and one without, and the one without was outstanding. I have to say that the pre dessert and dessert was phenomenal and will be a dessert I remember for a long time. I can’t say the food isn’t good, because it is, but maybe it’s just that it’s something we’ve had before and not necessarily new; apart from the vinegar that is but that’s just not for us. We don’t regret going, and people should go and make up their own minds, but we have been to places without stars where the flavours and experience maybe trump it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r942489601-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,3,en
2024-02-16,D L,"Beautiful building with cozy decoration, extremely friendly staff, very interesting tastes, but the food should not be offered as a 'bite testing' menu, maybe a few 'plates' less could allow the clients to enjoy more the food experience.

2024-02-06,Ryan Otto Ulrich,"Soil stands out from the crowd with a refreshingly low-fi approach to fine farm-to-table dining, bringing the bounty of the sea to the harvest of the field.  The autumn menu was delightfully balanced, well paced and enthusiastically presented. Recommend the premium wine paring. On this visit, the lobster, caviar and A5 wagyu supplements were sublime.  Overall vibes were unfussy, uncomplicated and very much a team effort - where no one person seemed to want to be the star. Looking back on notes from the evening, this passage from Emerson comes to mind:  “Let the stoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is keen.”  Athens has some very fine places to dine. Soli is the place to go to if you want great food and warm hospitality to be at the center of your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r937116721-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,5,en

There was more assurance in the preparation of the dishes (we loved the tartare and the goat with white truffle was exquisite) , the ingredients were as always top quality and cooked to perfection, and the team was now more unified and relaxed — we welcomed the new sommelier who was knowledgeable without being pretentious: we chose the vintage pairing and tried some intriguing wines, it was stimulating to taste something unknown such as the Blanc de blanc by Ott or a grüner Veltliner who’s producer I can’t recall, while the homemade amaro was an interesting surprise. We felt cherished customers which gave us much pleasure and created a warm ambience. The setting is sober without unnecessary glitz, and the bouquet that rested on our napkin filled our evening with woodland perfumes.

2023-12-02,Dimitris S,"We visited this restaurant in December 2023. To our surprise, it's housed in an old house (we felt like we were visiting our grandmother's house). The space didn't impress us at all due to its age, quite the opposite actually. However, the team consists of young and polite individuals, and the service is exceptional.  The 14-course degustation menu is interesting, but as I mentioned, it doesn't fit well in this setting. There are also many additional extras if you'd like, such as a bite of lobster (+45 euros), caviar (+20), white truffle (+32), or Wagyu A5 (+36 euros). Furthermore, the wine list is quite overpriced. There is a balcony at the back of the house where we discovered a garden on two levels with trees and flowers; this was a plus for the old house. I won't visit again due to the ambiance. Since this team deserves something better, I suggest relocating to a more iconic space.

Atmosphere and design as well pretty nice.  Prices for sparkling wine and corresponding wine pairing on the other hand are a rip-off. Charging 20 EUR for a glass of Karanika which can be bought for 18 EUR a bottle in a shop is not acceptable. You are getting glasses of champagne in other restaurants for this price. The so called premium wine pairing for 135 EUR each person has been underwhelming.  Not a single bottle of these wines is charged more than 20 EUR in a shop. In total you are getting eight small glasses which adds up to one bottle of wine. Pricing for wines is unfortunately unbearable in this restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d23750939-r924087710-Soil_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,3,en

Honestly every course was amazing but I think the cod was our favorite. We did wine pairing as well and got to try a lot of interesting wines. When I said I didn’t like the one they were nice enough to replace it with something else. They also paced the meal based on what we were doing not just a standard which I think speaks highly of the staff and bring attentive. We are fast eaters and caught up to a few table around us during the course of the meal. Took pix of all the courses but don’t want to ruin the surprise so only attaching 2 of them.

2023-10-02,Getmetothegreek,"With thunderstorms forecast in Athens that evening, our reservation was put back half an hour until 2130, but this was not a problem, and is completely understandable. The restaurant sent us a message around midday, so we had plenty of notice. It also meant that we were unable to eat in the garden, which was a shame, but again, this was beyond anyone's control. On arrival, the welcome felt very rushed: The ""meet the chef"" experience was limited to a quick ""hello"" to (obviously) very busy staff in the kitchen, before we were hurried up the stairs (my wife struggling to keep up in her heels) whilst we were given an extremely brief explanation of the history of the building and the philosophy of the restaurant. It was all a bit of a blur really, and didn't add to the experience at all, making us slightly uncomfortable from the off, and perhaps it would have been better to have seated us first.The restaurant interior is very handsome (split into several separate dining rooms), with high ceilings, wooden floors and minimalist but tasteful decoration. It does perhaps lack the atmosphere of eating in the garden, however. The service we received was very professional, as one would expect, but seemed to lack a genuine warmth. The food was generally excellent, and presented superbly, and we enjoyed every dish with the exception of the eel, which my wife did not like, but I was happy to finish hers. For us, the standout dishes were the oyster and the goat. The only criticism I would make, is that the bread course is served halfway through the meal. We would have preferred it at the start, and used it to mop up the juices from the dishes where necessary, particularly when many were served in ridged dishes, making it practically impossible to spoon up the remainders. I am not too proud to pick up and slurp, however. We chose a reasonably-priced bottle of white (the menu was weighted towards fish and seafood) from the wine list, rather than taking one of the wine pairing options.  In summary, it was a very nice special evening out on the last night of our trip, and was good value for money, but perhaps lacked a little something to make it a truly memorable one.

In 2013 and 2015, it was named the best restaurant in the world by 50 best. His well-known cooking techniques such as perfume, sous vide and distillation come from a chocolate pie that his grandmother Montserrat Fontané, who is still the chef at Can Roca (opened in 1967), cooked for him when he was a child. It was this ordinary chocolate pie that started Joan Roca i fontan's culinary career for more than 20 years and taught science and cooking courses at Harvard University.

2024-11-03,HT1,"Once I knew that I was going to be in Girona for a few days I added my name to the wait list and to my surprise got a call about two weeks before offering me a table.  I accepted with excitement.   While overall it was a very pleasant experience, I did feel it fell short in a few areas to live up to the reputation it holds.    There was several wow moments with the food, but it got a little laboured near in the end.   Perhaps there is too many dishes and too much richness?    For me, I felt that the service dissapointed.   It felt cold and too rehearsed.   Often the next course was already waiting on the side while I was eating the previous and it was swapped over too quickly for me.   I accept clockwork was necessary due to the volume of dishes but it all felt a littled pressurised.    I declined the wine pairing (purely on the basis of the volume involved) and prefered a few special glasses of wine along the way.  I dont think this was appreciated by the Sommelier and I was forgotten.

The 45-customer restaurant continues the Catalonian focus but given spectacular depth and scope by Joan’s adaptive creativity.  Feasting on a signature degustacion offering like, say, the “Festival Menu” that we enjoyed, the questing diner understands why Joan’s impressively realized gustatory imaginings made El Celler de Can Roca one of the only four restaurants with multiple “Best Restaurant in the World” accolades - at par with Napa’s “The French Laundry” with two, and only behind the legendary “El Bulli” and Copenhagen’s “Noma” at five Firsts each.

2024-05-21,Anna M,"We travelled to Girona specifically to visit this restaurant.  We were so excited to get a reservation and built our trip around this visit.  We wanted to visit after seeing the Chef's Table episode on Netflix and were expecting something very special.  We have been to many Michelin restaurants with a few 3 star under our belts.  This experience was very average and does not align with what one would expect for a 3 star rating.  It was awkward from the moment we entered where there was no one at the front to greet us and we stood around looking for someone to help us out.  We thought maybe we came through the wrong door!!  Not a single question was asked of why we were there (Anniversary, Birthday, etc.) , where we were from, etc..  The restaurant itself is very nice - very comfortable setting with a beautiful natural landscape in the center and nicely spaced tables.  After sitting we waited a while again for the menu and water service, which in Europe I am OK with, but for a place like this it is not acceptable.  These are little things, but definitely not what is expected for a restaurant at this level.  We were at Disfrutar a few nights earlier and the service was exceptional and they made a real effort to appreciate that you were at their establishment.    As far as the menu goes we opted for the short menu - our mistake - if you do go be sure to get the longer experience because the timing isn't much longer and some key dishes are missing from the short menu - especially the desserts.  The food was good but nothing was exceptional.  Execution and quality of the ingredients is what you would expect, but nothing was good enough to talk to your friends about.  In fact, the main meat dish, which was a take on a beef Wellington, but used poultry elements was just not good and not incredibly original.  The ratio of the dough to the filling was off so there was more crust than needed and not a very tasty execution of the proteins.    The biggest letdown was the desserts, the primary reason we came, which were very average.  The first dish was an ensemble made from sheep's milk - this was pretty good and had a cone that had the scent of a sheep which made it kind of fun.  The next dish was confusing.  It was supposed to be a take on the memories from reading books, I think, where the aroma is supposed to based on the smell of old books.  We were given a splash of oil on the hands that was supposed to be this scent, which you licked before embarking on eating the dish.  The dish was not interesting and did not provide any sort of continuity both in flavor or texture and did not seem to align with the theme that was explained to us.  The dish also did not go well with the first dessert because both desserts were pretty heavy milk based recipes.  Finally - in fear of sounding pretentious, when I went to go to the restrooms I was super confused on where they were so I walked back and forth across the mirrored walls looking for the door, which ended my night in a similar way that it started - awkward...  Most Michelin restaurants walk you to the restrooms and ensure that you know your way around.  Our opinion is that El Celler de Can Roca is at a Michelin level but definitely not worth a special trip nor did the service or food stand out as anything special.  We have had more creative dishes both in presentation and flavor at many other restaurants and service was not on par with the other 2 and 3 star restaurants we have visited.  Even many of the one star restaurants had a more immersive and welcoming experience than El Celler de Can Roca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r951771154-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,3,en
2024-05-04,Greg T,"We've tried for two years to get a booking as we've lost out to the bots, so we had high hopes for our one-year wedding anniversary dinner after staying up until midnight to get this booking (we got married near Girona, so this place had a lot of meaning.) We also chose to have our wedding dessert from rocambolesc last year so this restaurant meant so much to us. We actually told the staff this, and they didn't care at all!!!!. The last 3 Michelin-starred restaurant we ate at was HÉLÈNE DARROZE last month, and wow, did they bring out all the stops!!! (they made a special newspaper for us and as soon as we entered they told us how grateful they were to choose them to celebrate our lunch with them. From the moment we entered their restaurant, we were made to feel so special. At el celler de can rocca, however,  no one was made to feel special that we could see, especially us! . We chose to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary here, and we truly regret this decision. We had even said before we would bring our wedding party back here for our ten years - sadly, we wouldn't even come back for petit fours.   When you choose to save and spend your hard-earned money at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant, which is at least £1000 for a couple, you would hope that you at least get greeted well. They couldn't even find out booking initially!   The food, in all honesty, was pretty boring, void of fun and personality, and everything had a foam or emulsion that tasted the same.  I've never felt the need to say something in a place like this, but I was so frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. When I excused myself and asked to speak to someone, I was met with excuses of how they were going to bring out a dessert for us. However, it was a little too late. The effort should have been made from the moment we arrived. I appreciated the apology, but it wasn't really heart felt.   This restaurant has no business holding three Michelin stars! That extra star is reserved for the wonderful restaurants that go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and appreciated.   I had hoped something special would happen at the end the meal to make up for the truly poor experience but it did not manifest.   take your money elsewhere to restaurants that do not rely on reputation.

2023-08-08,melandashfoodies,"Sorry for my belated review, I am playing catch up. Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.  It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.  The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me,  having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more  theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine!   The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.  A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r908812594-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2023-08-02,James T,"This is everything you'd expect from a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars.  The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre.  The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.  We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience.""  We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours.  A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink.  The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.  Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.  I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.  The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.  Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything.  It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc).  The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.  The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.  A truly memorable experience highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r907384675-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2023-07-28,Gerard Lopez,"What an incredible amazing lunch we have had here. We sat at a table from 12.45 h to almost 18.00 h and it flew by in a minute.  Excellent food , well served and explained by our very professional waiter Alex.  13 appetizers followed by the Feast menu of 13 plates may seem a lot but it’s not.  It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment.  Highlight of the day was the kindness and availability of the 3 Roca brothers who took  time to take a photo with us and were kind enough to show us their kitchen.  Chapeau !!!

2023-07-06,Joanne P,"We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines).  There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch.   Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post'  - put in my bag for later disposal).  There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac,  the langostine and the caramelised apricot.  Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r900948718-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en

2023-06-14,Oscar,"Service/Decor: The restaurant is beautiful—modern, clean, and simply decorated without being sterile, the decor and natural lighting makes the place warm and inviting. The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.  Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.  Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience. Do not be intimated by the restaurant’s prestige, the experience is fun, challenging, delicious, and magical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r895138883-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en

As a frugal individual who does not typically spend my hard earned dollars frivolously, this splurge was absolutely worth every penny and then some.

What started as great slowly turned to feeling very full and could not even finish couples of last dishes. We just wonder the necessity of having that many dishes. I think the dish could finish much earlier ie. around 8 dishes. It's more than enough in satifsying our palates and fulfilling our appetite. Afterwards, the dishes felt like a redundant.

2022-09-09,Didier B,"Not easy to find the entrance of the restaurant but we were looking forward to discovering this new place for us. The welcome was cordial and the design of the place let us expecting a nice moment to come. In fact, it was not as we expect and I would say a big disappointment. The amuse bouche was not so original and tasteless, a Gravelax trout that we could not recogner the taste with a spice less guacamole. The starters with ingredients we could not recognise like the Parmesan tile neither by the taste, neither by the way they have been cooked. The fish was over cooked and the the side dishes proposed did not match the dish. And finally the dessert even if it was a best seller and described as peak of the dinner by the waiter was not at all what we call a fireworks. So our only conclusion, as the place was empty that night (3 tables only), something has happened not to have the right ingredients in the kitchen, not to have the right people cooking, not to have the standard quality of s’écrive expected for this type of restaurant for the price we paid (100euro per person).

The roof top terrace bar was excellent. Great staff and lovely cocktails with an amazing view of cognac and the surrounding countryside.  We ate in La Distillerie restaurant where unfortunately things were not so good.  Service was poor and rushed, and the staff seemed miserable with little conversation or introduction of dishes. The white wine was served warm with an excuse of hot weather outside! Maybe keep the wine in a working fridge?  The food was average. Undercooked fish, basic starter, bland dessert and too much emphasis on ‘decoration’ rather than taste.  Wish we had looked for a local, owner/chef restaurant rather than a ‘look at my star’ venue.

The cheese selection was tasty, albeit I was surprised it was served with a salad and not crackers.   Wines available by the glass were limited, however those tried were very good (white and red).

2024-11-03,Tryggve Nielsen,"Welcome to Maaemo! Norways first 3-stars Michelin restaurant. A dinner at Norways  top restaurant without kids is something we had been eagerly looking forward to. Food, wine and service is good, but jokingly we told ourselves at the start of the service, what if this is actually being part of The Menu?   After finishing of the meal at the dining hall, we are led back to chill out lounge where we started. Coffee is served, but suddenly the friendly waiter which has treated us nicely throughout the evening, comes to our table and asks us to come for a tour to visit the kitchen. In the middle of serving hot coffee this feels a bit peculiar, and we ask to bring our cups with us. Not a problem at all! He shows us everything that is going on there, fridge, main kitchen, winters menu etc. We walk around, smile and ask questions to show interest in what is shown to us. We are a bit puzzled why this tour is actually given and don't really see the main point, but we chat along and remark to him and others how nice everything is.  Well back at the chill out lounge we are served dessert and more coffee. My wife asks, could I have decaf? Sure, we'll take care of this. But nothing happens. The night is still young, so I would like a drink and ask the waiter to see the drink menu. ""Sorry, we don't have this"". ""Can I order a Macallan 25 yrs, I can see you have a bottle in the bar"". ""Let me check"". The waiter comes back a bit later. ""Sorry, we have stopped serving alcohol now"". The clock is around 22.30. Wow, that was early.. suddenly the same waiter come back and start serving wine to the neighbouring table. So strange, we are denied but others are still served?!? We ask the waiter about this. ""Sorry, but we can't serve you anything more. Based on your behaviour no more for you guys"". ""Sorry, what?"" ""Yes, based on bad things that went on at the kitchen tour, it's no more for you guys"". ""Ehhh, sorry what do you mean we did at the kitchen?"" ""You walked around with coffee cups, and your wife put her cup on the kitchen table"" ""Eh sorry what? We brought the cups back with us, and bringing the coffee with us was ok for you."" ""Sorry can't help you. No more alcohol for you"". ""Are you saying that we are drunk"" ""No."" ""Are you accusing my wife for bad behaviour?"" ""Ehh, sorry I don't know what to tell you"" ""But what is going on??"" ""Sorry, I'm not allowed to say any more"". ""Ok, we're out of here. Give us the bill and our jackets.""   This is by far the worst experience we've ever had at a restaurant, regardless of number of Michelin stars.  A horrible rip-off without comparison, a total lack of respect for the customer, and an arrogant and rude behaviour with no limitation. Thanks Espen Holmboe Bang for a great night at your restaurant!!!! Spending 15K and then total humiliation from your waiters is absolutely worth the price. As we told the waiter while we tore the menu in two and threw it at his feet while we left, we will never visit this craphole ever again. More like Kafkas The Process than The Menu - the staff treat you horribly but no-one is able to tell you why. But please visit Maaemo if this is your cup of tea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r978486097-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,1,en
2024-09-08,Shiloh T,"try to write more on this later, but the main thing ! would call maaemo is amusing, because you'll eat there and be like ""how on earth did someone think this deserved Michelin stars?"" The service is fine, it's about what you'd expect at that price point, but not beyond. Don't go in expecting fun surprises, but your water glass will remain full and your napkin will (usually) be replaced when you get up and go to the bathroom. The food is so jaw-droppingly unremarkable you'll wonder if someone is playing a trick on you. I just finished dining there, and this was the big occasion dining experience of my honeymoon, and no joke the best things I had tonight were some broth and a nice little bite of brown butter ice cream. That's not acceptable at a such a price point. Do I regret going to Maaemo? Obviously, but at the same time, it was kind of funny and inspiring. It makes me want to work harder and now I'm quite certain that if I spent a few months preparing, I too could make a Michelin quality meal.

2024-08-24,Amstraveler,"The hardest lunch choice is what to drink.  I’m normally a fan of pairing wines and Maaemo does what I really like and offers three different quality packages (at three different price levels).  But buying wine in Norway is a bit overextravagant under any circumstances - the NOK 16000 ‘Holy Grail’ pairing, while it would undoubtedly have been divine, was no exception.  Many guests limited themselves to water but we went for a juice pairing which was an unexpected delight.  Mixtures like cherry juice with a hint of nettle and toasted hazelnut were surprisingly successful (especially when pairing a dish with hazelnut in the sauce) - I’ll have a go at making some of the mixtures myself now.  Food (in the 14 courses) mostly superb, some merely very good.  For me the starters and main courses beat the desserts (three ice cream dishes perhaps one too many) with the signature oyster/mussel and king crab/reindeer combos as highlights. Coffee weak. Unlimited water.  Ambience superb, service formal and a little subdued but extremely attentive, around 10 tables each of 1 or 2 people when we were there.  Amusingly we sat next to one gentleman whose vacations consisted mostly of visiting the world’s best restaurants (and told everyone in earshot about his visits).  He felt the restaurant lacked a star performer on the service team (maitre d’ or whatever) which was to him essential in a top restaurant.  Maaemo indeed works with a flat org structure front of house so for someone to whom a star performer out front is critical to their enjoyment - well go elsewhere or forget your prejudice and just enjoy the dishes.  No background music until the last couple of dishes were served.  Prices as advertised - very high; but that’s Norway for you.  Watch out when reservations open - I tried for supper the day of our visit and the restaurant was fully booked half an hour before reservations were supposed to open. Lunch was still available.  Maybe there’s a secret trick that increases your chance of success ….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r966572767-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en

Just compared to other 3* places most dishes were lacking elaborated details and surprises. The non alcoholic pairing was as well a little uninspired and starters (amuse bouche) as well as the sweets towards the end of the dining experience (the parts to be taken on the lower floor) a bit too simple “sweet&fatty” and thus a bit disappointing.

2024-07-31,RorschAch,"Maaemo 2.0, a three-star Michelin restaurant in Oslo, Norway, is the only two three-star Michelin restaurants in Norway (also ranked 47th in the world in 2021). It reopened in 2019 and was awarded three Michelin stars. Its predecessor (which won three Michelin stars in 2016 but closed 9 years after its opening) is located above the train tracks leading to Oslo Central Station and is only 300 meters away from the old site. The name comes from the Old Norwegian translation of ‘Mother Earth’, although its chef Esben Holmboe Bang is actually Danish. But since he has spent most of his culinary career in Oslo, his cooking style is to explore the flavors of local Norwegian ingredients. According to him, 85% of the ingredients come from within 30 miles of Oslo, and the rest of the seafood on the menu, such as wild salmon cooked in salt butter, comes from the pristine waters of the northern coast of Norway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r962593813-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

Small bites were good, their oyster dish was very fishy, crab too salty, we asked for no mushrooms (and they said yes but had to remind-several times), there was a 30 min gap between one dish, we sent back a glass of merlot that was quite bad (from the Rhone) and rest of dishes very average.  Wine list not up to 3 star restaurant (but reasonably priced…for Oslo)-but we bought a 500$ Mersault which was quite good.  Very nice room.  BIG problem is Chef who thinks he is Guy Savoy (and is not)-they asked for feedback and we mentioned the above and Chef came to our table HOT and berated us-mentioning he did not have a microwave and suggested we could end our dining experience.  We gladly we took him up on that and saved a lot of money.

2023-09-17,Michael U,"As the only Michelin 3* Restautant in Norway Maaemo carries a banner, ""Mother Earth"" in Finnish Chef Esben Holmboe Bang serves a menu focused on organic, biodynamic, and raw local ingredients with the end-goal being zero waste but no restrictions in terms of taste or technique.   Found in the Oslobukta neighborhood diners begin and end in the lounge while a high-ceilinged dining room utililzes organic materials and dramatic lighting to draw attention to an open kitchen working in near silence across 15 courses.  Danish by heritage, though Esben’s plates consistently pay homage to Norwegian traditions, it comes as no surprise that Dinner begins with Potato Lompe topped in Cod plus Horseradish before proceeding through bites including Foie Gras, local Cheese and raw Beef topped in Pine Cone Vinegar.  Occasionally giving in to ""New Nordic"" ideals, though Butter and Fat see Maaemo’s flavors trend more rich than its contemporaries, plates in the dining room began with smoked Vendace Roe perfumed by elderflower that paired beautifully to 2020 Benjamin Leroux Chassagne-Montrachet.  Benefited by faultless service, every staff member executing at the highest level of personal yet professional engagement, Scallops arrived next with tart Fruits preceding Bang’s iconic Flat Oyster with Blue Mussels and Dill that has been a mainstay since 2010.  Pulling back in terms of intensity with a subtle plate of Turnips and Nettles, then serving a recently added slice of Char in a complicated Sauce that vacillates from sweet to savory, the night’s “main course” featured half a roasted Quail with Plums and Sunchokes alongside golden Milk Bread and a decorative spread made from Mushrooms with Garlic.  Cleansing the palate with earthy Consomme, bold but nuanced and a good bridge to Dessert placing Rhubarb amidst florals, it is here that diners return to the lounge for Coffee and sweets including Maaemo’s historic Brown Butter Ice Cream and hot, sticky Cinnamon Buns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r917041872-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.

2022-11-14,reisermedfamilie,"The only trouble with this establishment was finding the entrance, something that took a walk around the block, as we missed it at first glance.  It is discretely located on the corner of a block,  with an unassuming wooden door, where the only clue is a small brass plate above a door buzzer.   Other than that a perfect experience.  We found the difficulty in finding the entrance something to laugh about, not troubling.  Nonetheless, be sure to arrive a bit early, in order to locate the entrance. We appreciated being given a small folder with a  list of all of the courses, once  Once you buzz the door, you enter the vestibule where your coats are taken. Then you proceed to the ""living room"" downstairs, where welcome drinks and the first three to four courses are served.  Beautiful pieces of art to look at!  To describe these starters as an explosion of tastes would not do them true service.  These hors dóuevres are a carefully orchestrated gustatory  symphony of contrasting and complimenting tastes.  Be aware that the champagne costs extra.    After the starters,  you proceed to the dining room on the main floor, where several more courses are served, each one an experience in itself, with balanced combinations of flavours that I would not have imagined.  Each dish was lovely to look at, delightful to tase.  Then it is back to the ""living room"" to wind down with desserts.  The service was excellent, formal and highly attentive, yet still friendly and approachable with any questions.  The staff worked as a well-orchestrated team to ensure that the diners were served their courses with precision, and that any questions were answered. You can watch the cooks make the final preparations with precision.  We were a party of four, where I was the only one to take the wine package, which was very good, but perhaps a bit of a let-down given the price tag.  Nonetheless, I would probably go for the wine pairing again if I did it once more.  Be aware that each glass of wine is for about three courses.  One of the others took two glasses of wine, one white and one red, with the main courses. and were very pleased.  One member of the group  took a non-alcoholic beverage pairing which was remarkably good, an unconventional combination of ingredients that resulted in an impressive drink.  Yes, this experience does costs a small fortune, but it is worth it.  It was impressive on so many levels.  Be aware that this is a set menu.

I expect any three-star restaurant to have pretensions about its food, but I found Maaemo beyond pretentious. The servers were nice enough but so formal that the effect was chilling. First we we were taken to a dimly lit basement room for our starters. I could barely see what I was eating!  As each of the five  one-bite starters were presented, the waiter recited the ingredients--each of the five seemed to have five ingredients!  Precisely one hour later (everything here is timed to the  minute), I and the other diners were escorted up  to the dining room. The decor was stark but attractive and there was was more light here. My waitress stood  at my table and recited the ingredients of each of the eight main courses. Again, she was nice, but stiff. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, ""So, what's the next course going to be?"" ""Oh, I can't tell you that ahead of time."" (To be fair, she gave me a hint.)  The food itself was generally good, but only a few dishes stood out as excellent--disappointing for a three-star restaurant. And  I'm all for innovative food pairings, but the ""shoulder of crab with reindeer heart"" took this concept a bit over the top. I must say that every course was artistically plated. An hour and a half later, to the second, it was downstairs again, for dessert. I enjoyed most of the desserts more than I had enjoyed the starters.   Half an hour later came the check, which was exorbitant, but not inappropriately so. This was not my favorite restaurant meal, but it was my most interesting restaurant experience.

2023-06-07,James Y,"My wife and I and friends spent a weekend at La Cote Saint Jacques (“LCSJ”) Joigny in May. This was our fourth visit to La Cote Saint Jacques, spanning four decades. We had a wonderful time at this extraordinary venue. La Cote Saint Jacques has continued to evolve and reach new heights during its long and illustrious history. There is no better “base” from which to enjoy the marvelous wines and the charming village of Chablis and the villages of northern Burgundy.  We note that although Michelin has awarded two stars to LCSJ, in our judgment, LCSJ has always been a three star experience, offering far warmer hospitality and spectacular cuisine than we have experienced at three MIchelin star establishments in Burgundy and throughout France. In fact, we have had disappointing experiences at three star restaurants both with respect to the food and service at other venues, which pale in comparison to the service, graciousness and superb cuisine of LCSJ.  From the moment of arrival, guests are greeted warmly by the Lorain family and its long time staff, led by Marine Lorain. Ms. Lorain is deeply committed to maintaining the family’s great traditions of hospitality which extends over three generations and begins a fourth generation. As in past years, the service throughout our visit was impeccable, from the housekeeping to the spa and the massage therapy was excellent.  Sine our last visit, rooms at this “country inn” have been renovated. The accommodations are spacious; the bathrooms generously proportioned. Many rooms have views of the Yvonne River. The hotel  is situated on the bank of the river; its grounds have been beautifully landscaped, featuring spectacular cast iron sculptures from Sylvain Subervie which are illuminated at night.  The cuisine at La Cote Saint Jacques is extraordinary, a reflection of the culinary wizardry of Jean-Michel Lorain, now joined in the kitchen by his talented nephew, Alexandre Bondoux. In past years, the exceptional cuisine at LCSJ may have been considered to be “classical”; it has evolved and reached new heights, brilliantly marrying classical French techniques with modern, international influences. It is astonishingly refined and delicious. LCSJ also offers instructive cooking classes which we have enjoyed during previous visits.   Our dinners at LCSJ had many highlights, from the ethereal oyster terrine to the Flottante with Caviar, richly textured foie gras de canard, delicate blanquette de hommard and outstanding Ris de Veau (with ginger accents) to Agneau de lait des Pyrenees, a springtime lamb delight. However, the “piece de resistance” of our weekend was a birthday surprise for my wife - a magnificent Poulet de Bresse cooked in a coquette sealed with pastry dough and served with a melange of baby vegetables cooked with the famous Bresse bird. The Poulet de Bresse in coquette, a traditional technique for this renowned bird, was the idea of Matthias Lermercier, the restaurant’s adroit and acutely attentive manager and Stephen Guyard, the Maitre ‘ d who was our culinary guide throughout the weekend.Mr. Guyard is one of the most skilled, knowledgeable and gracious servers we have ever encountered in France. For a birthday dessert, Mr. Guyard presented a stunningly delicious “Mille Feuille”  with the lightest of crème filling, a fitting end to this incredible evening, a perfect interplay of opulence and elegance.  Together,  Matthias and Stephen worked to ensure that this was a special celebratory weekend for my wife and helped us to navigate through the spectacular dishes coming from the Lorain-Bondoux kitchen. Together with the outstanding Chablis and Burgundy in the LCSJ cellar (including a 2012 Les Clos from Dauvissat and a 2017 Valmur  from Raveneau), we had dinners that ranked among the finest we have had  -  truly at a three Michelin star level. The service in the restaurant  from Stephen and Matthias was so remarkably gracious and professional (and with abundant good humor), that it was reminiscent of the legendary service team at Taillevent from its late, revered owner Jean-Claude Vrinat and his long time lieutenants, Jean-Frederic Guidoni and Jean-Marie Ancher. We thank the Lorain family and the entire La Cote Saint Jacques team for its extraordinary hospitality. We look forward to returning to this elegant and magical venue.

2020-08-06,Matvl,"We booked well in advance and enjoyed a lovely lunch at La Côte Saint Jacques. The lunch menu was small but lovely - our highlights were the lobster starter, duck main course and raspberry desert all of which were exceptional.   The wine pairings were good though perhaps a little predictable. Service was excellent and there is an English version of the menu and good level of English for most staff.   Definitely recommended if you’re looking for something special - with prices that are high as you’d expect from a 2 star Michelin restaurant.   Do book well in advance.

You can even walk by the nice underground passage. Food was great, service excellent despite the COVID and the mask weared by all staff .  My only point of unpleasementless was the sommelier which was quite passive and did not help us to make the best choise.  I recomment the Ile flottante au caviar “Kristal“ and the lamb as well as the Homard “Pattes bleues“.

2017-12-09,Paul C,"We wanted to visit this restaurant since September this year (2017) and we finally ended up going in December. It was a disappointment. First of all, it is in the middle of nowhere, we drove 2 hours from Paris (where we live) to get there.   Since we arrived at 7:00PM and the restaurant opens at 7:30PM, we were kindly invited to sit in the hotel lunge area and had a cocktail and an 'amuse bouche'. Then, the waiter asked us, @7:45PM if we wanted to be escorted to pour table: we gladly said yes, and got up... by the time we did, he was gone, and we would up sitting there for a good 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us what we want. For a Michelin restaurant with pretentions, this is unacceptable in terms of service.  The restaurant is at -1 on the hotel's floor plan: while descending with the elevator, my wife remarked it reminded her of going down to the OR when she had her last surgical operation.   The dishes are well prepared, at least for the main course, but very off balance: basically, you get a chuck of mean with no side (garniture), for some 76 EUR. They could at least have thrown in a third leaf of spinach to the two they forgot on the plate. If you also go for the starters, please take out another 88 EUR for two small scallops (per person). The gentleman next to our table had to put his glasses on to find them on his plate... don't get me wrong, I do not mind paying for quality but this is ridiculous.  For desert, the 3D chocolate that my wife had looked like a nightmare from a spacial geometry class, and was so sweet she could not eat it. My desert, the 'millefeuille' was way too sweet and wound up giving me acid burn, so I wound up taking a pill to try and bet able to digest when I got home. And by the way, the breadcrumbs that were on the desert plate brought pompously to my table by the waiter, and then wiped off in hurry by the waiter...  This place would have potential, if they had any sense of getting the portions and proportions right, but they have no idea. Honestly, go to Le Pret Catalan in Paris or Le Oiseau Blanc, you will pay less, have a hugely better meal, and won't have to drive 4 hours to the middle of nowhere and back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196540-d1440197-r546288365-La_Cote_Saint_Jacques-Joigny_Yonne_Bourgogne_Franche_Comte.html,1,en

The signature Oyster terrine was unusual; very pretty to look at but, at the end of the day was just oysters. The Zander - a delicate river fish - had too much sauce and ""bready"" elements in both sauce and as additions. The snail dish was very nice although presentation could have been more refined. The flavours in the lamb were wrong and overpowering.

It was even better than the last visit as we were able to sample the spring/summer menu. Service was outstanding, attentive but not hovering. The dining room is quiet yet not stuffy. We asked the som to suggest a wine given our description of preference in a white wine. He suggested a modest chablis (60 euro) rather than a super pricey selection. It was spot on for our taste. Multiple choices for the fixed price menu, plus an excellent a la carte listing offered variety and quality as well. Be sure to order the oyster ""pate"" that appears to have been made with whole, raw (uncooked) oysters. Excellent.

The gardens were beautiful, herbs, fruit and veg growing everywhere. all the space was utilised.   We had initially booked the 7 course taster menu. But upon our arrival for pre dinner drinks, Innes, the manager offered us a choice of 7, 10 or 15 courses.  He explained about all the options and even diminished my fears about the eels and sweetbread. He was right on both accounts. Absolutely delicious and not what I had expected.   Natalia and Ed looked after us so well. Ed was our sommelier and Natalia was so wonderfully knowledgeable about our food they made our dining experience feel more unique.  This was a celebration to mark 25 years together but 21 years of marriage.   Well what can I say about the food. We could see Sat Bains in the kitchen. His creative mind and food was beyond expectations. His mushroom tartlet was heaven in a mouthful and it topped the tartlet I previously had in a two Michelin star restaurant.

The staff were waiting for us at the door with a smile and welcoming greeting. We were escorted into the bar, after allowing to choose between there or the garden. Once sat, they brought a stool for my handbag, the bar menu and the wine BIBLE! A sommelier came to speak us thru the wines, then a restaurant manager came to talk us through the menu. We then were shown to our table and waiter for the evening. We had a surprise off menu courses which we got to watch being cooked in the garden. The whole meal was spectacular. I dont want to spoil anything but let's just say there was some flare with some courses. Very happy with the whole experience.

2024-06-06,K.D,"As a party of 4, we chose to have an overnight stay with the chef's table and a 12 (or was it 13) courses with wine paring.  Having never even been to a Michelin-star, I think going to this incredible 2 Star has completely spoilt me for future restaurant visits. The food was incredible, with a well-orchestrated sommelier and chefs presenting their own food created at the stations in a very calm kitchen. Each person at the top of their game. It was like watching a dance, with each station carefully putting together the dish; watching it was hypnotic. The sommelier was a great guy, they really knew the wine and how it paired with the food. I have never believed in wine pairing with food. Still, when he brought out a Gruner Veltliner (Austria), which initially tasted like 4-star petrol, however after he humoured my blunt remark, he told me to eat my dish. Then he returned to the wine (which was a different taste) so im not converted 10/10.  One of the dishes led us to a greenhouse where the young chef cooked garlic bread with a Cornish beer and the best (and oldest) parmesan i have ever had in front of us. this was a really nice touch explaining the ingredients and the sourcing of the food (provenance)   I have never tasted food like it, it was perfection.  The bedroom for the night was basic and quite small, but in my view, the aim is to not be in your room unless you are sleeping, so it played a little part in the night.   The breakfast was incredible. My wife ( having had 13 wines the night before) didn't turn up to breakfast, and any man worth his salt ordered his own 3-course breakfast as well as his wife's. It was the best 6-course breakfast I have ever eaten.   Only 2 points of feedback re :  1. Sat Bains comes and meets you at the chef's table; I think he is happier in a gym (he looks like he's a Gym lad). He is quite a serious guy, I think cracking a smile only happens when he PBs on a bench (I joke). It would have been good to have met the head chef.   2. Morning breakfast felt rushed—it almost felt like a checkout and off-you-go scenario (I didn't think we were that long, but I did have a food coma).

2024-04-14,places2seethings2do,"After not being here for some years, I had a certain expectation with a 2-star restaurant. Overall experience was underwhelming. Food was pretty average for a fine dining restaurant. Flavours were not memorable, and the use of gels was rather dated and added, neither texture nor flavour. Noise level was unacceptable. Certainly overpriced for moderate food. The use of fake candles just sums it up. When questioned, the waiter explained that real candles were causing the walls to be stained. That was the worst untruth I have heard in a long time. I'm not sure how they got their 2 stars, but I have dined in many not starred restaurants that severed better fare. Will not be back and certainly not worth the money for mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, the food was not bad. It was just average and ordinary.

As usual we discovered different dishes this time, such as venison and the squab pigeon (see photo)  which was absolutely delicious.  I was particularly pleased to see my favourite scallop dish on the menu! The staff all go the extra mile to ensure that guests are made to feel welcome, and their friendly smiles go a long way to guaranteeing that.

2023-12-20,Jan,"The food served don’t deserve 2 Michelin stars, I was so excited to be dining here for lunch. After dining at many one star restaurants my imagination was going wild at what we’d be served.  The hors d’ oeuvres were underwhelming, one was a jelly sweet smothered in sugar! The bread was cold and was not fresh at all. The fish course was served on some sort of crust, this tasted stale. The fish itself did not of the texture of fish and was tasteless. As the dishes were brought out the more disappointed we became. Not one dish had a flavour explosion or brought any happiness. Not one dish seemed complete and everyone lacked something. As for the candy floss dessert, i tried, it failed not worth the calories. We paid the £440 bill for 2 and left speechless and hungry. Giving this restaurant 2 Michelin stars is a license to print money. If you’d like a Michelin experience half the price try Adams, Upstairs or even Simpsons in the midlands.

2015-06-01,Paul S,"We visited this restaurant in may, staying near Verona and looking for fancy place to have lunch. Checking the Guide L'Espresso (IMHO the most reliable guide for fine dining in Italy), I found this restaurant in Lonigo. All I can say is that this was really worth the drive (of 50 min.)!  The restaurant is quite modern in style, but in a warm, comfortable way. The dining room is at the first floor, equipped with large windows delivering a superb view over the countryside and hills of Veneto.  The staff, leaded by Miss Cinzia, is professional and kind, making you feel welcome from the first minute.  We choose the lunch-menu, which consisted of a pasta, secondo and a little dessert. The lunch started of with some very nice and tasty appetizers. The pasta dish (gnocchi with asparagus and spinach) was fresher than fresh and a real threat for the tast buds. The secondo dish was a very well cooked piece of duck with some seasonal herbs and salad. Than a nice and refreshing/light dessert of fresh fruits and yoghurt foam. The lunch ended with an superb cup of espresso accompanied by homemade pastries. This was a superb lunch at only €40! A bargain at this level of dining!  The winelist is very extensive and delivers all the goods from Italy and the rest of the world at reasonable prices. The helpful sommelier is always there to put you in the right direction when it comes to wine/food matching. We had two really good bottles at very decent prices.  This is a place to look after when you around in the Veneto region and looking for a fancy place to dine. It was really worth the drive from Verona!   Highly recommendable and worth every penny!

First of all, the restaurant,  modern and beautifully located in the Veneto countryside: you may enjoy a pleasant view of the Berici Mountains from the large windows. Furniture is pure design, with a tasteful combination of several modern designers, including stylish chairs by Philippe Stark.  Food is supreme. Difficult to describe the ever changing menu, which ranges from appetizers to primi piatti and includes with the same taste and creativity both fish and meat. We are at the top of Italian cousine and you see it and you feel it. It is also a visual experience. Nothing to recommend in particular, and all to be recommended: how can you possibly recommend perfection? Just be tempted by the set menu “Ore 12” which gives you a flavor of different types of dishes. Wine list is in line with the quality of the food.

It is a place whose welcome is of whose cuisine has already been said all the good possible because you can not say anything but all the good possible. What is striking is the elegance that shines through in all the expressions of the place ... an elegance that stands on delicate balances but created and managed with mastery. There is never excess, never ostentation, never an attempt to put the merits of the place before you want the customer. Everything is elegant and simple at the same time ... as simple rubber ducks become designer furnishings, just as simple stale bread becomes a refined gourmet cracker, seemingly simple vegetables turn into an original tasting, innovative yet sober and contained ... elegant of that country elegance that you breathe looking from the large windows of the room ... an elegance without cracks, without uncertainties, a sign of a game of a team with deep roots, clear vision, shared goals.

2024-03-22,Luigi O.,"At Peca you really have a great experience. The place is very welcoming with a nice arrangement of tables in the different rooms of the structure. Elegant and tasteful furnishings. The owners and the entire staff welcomed us warmly and affectionately. Nicola Portinari's cuisine is absolutely worth trying to discover unique and particular sensations. The raw materials are treated with care and with cooking techniques that fully enhance their characteristics. The tasting menus are very interesting. For the occasion, however, both my table and I chose the à la carte dishes. Worth noting: the boom of baby squid, fermented ricotta and wild fennel, the risotto of black cabbage, horseradish and mountain goat's cheese, the ravioli of maruzzelle and chard with garlic and chilli pepper (stepitosi), the Livornese-style mullet, barbecue leek, eel baked with embers, shiitake, seaweed and daikon mixed salad, croaker with calamondin artichokes and ginger, ""Zeffiro"" guinea fowl with turmeric and spinach in two consistencies. A separate chapter should be dedicated to desserts or rather to the works of Pierluigi Portinari. Perfect in every way in preparation and presentation. They deserve to be mentioned: the dark chocolate soufflé, coffee ice cream, apricot and peated whisky, the lemon tart with almond sorbet and salted almonds. Another separate mention to make is the wine list or rather the very good and very knowledgeable sommelier Matteo. Just listening to the description of the wines that he makes with passion and with so much love and competence is worth a trip in itself.

When a guest - with a bird's appetite - is still hungry after the meal we tell ourselves that there is no point in going to the restaurant. 150 gr maximum all included, from appetizer to dessert. The lamb? Half a bite! Returning from fishing? Portions to cry, ten seconds of pleasure, but no more.

2024-03-13,Jean B,"Orléans is reconnecting with the prestige of the table. Having fallen into a gastronomic desert, the city finds with ""La table d'à coside"" a worthy successor to the 4 starred restaurants of the 80s.  A sober and very tasteful setting combines with an excellent welcome. At the table, a delicate presence settles in. You don't have to wait several long minutes before the Chef comes in person to invite you to open the ball of flavors. We avoid long hesitations among the choices by offering you 3 types of menus, which must satisfy the most demanding.  The Chef will then be followed by friendly and attentive staff who provoke the desire for discoveries to come.  To confirm the comparison to a ball, it is a series of ballets which follow one another where the actors of the composition of your choice come themselves to serve you and present their dishes to you. A very original method which illustrates, as in the theatre, a communion between the artists and the audience.  A well-deserved star.

Like you I was frustrated by having to call, not being able to book online, and not being able to use my hotel concierge.  Den takes reservations by phone only from 12-5pm Tokyo Time.  So I had 4 nights in Tokyo.  So I figure I got this.  First night:  155 calls all from 12-130 tokyo time.  Nothing  and phone was very busy.  Only every 20 minutes did it ring at all.  Second Night.  175 calls.  12-145.  Same as before except.  I went to bed woke up 3 hours later and called another 10 minutes and got through.(430 Tokyo time) but all booked and wait listed.  Third Night:  Was busy and could not call till 215 Tokyo Time.  It rang many more times than busy signals and I got a table.  Lesson on HOW TO GET A TABLE.  Dont call right at noon Tokyo time.  Wait till about 2pm (or 130pm if you have no patience)  I would bet your odds are way better as 1.  People have gotten tables.  2.  People have given up.     Lastly:  I was told you can email to ask about the days tables and to be added to the waitlist at 5pm Tokyo time (2 months in advance, the same night you are calling) and that may work.

2019-06-11,ChrisHOhio,"Yes, the reservation rules are absurd: by phone only between 12 and 5pm Tokyo time, precisely two months in advance. It seems every foodie on earth calls at precisely the same time, so the line rings busy, or the circuit doesn't work.  But after a few hundred attempts, a voice answers. A real live voice. She's Noriko, and you're immediately put at ease. You think ""This is going to be worth all the effort.""  Then you anxiously count down the days, having second thoughts about whether the frustration of all those international redials will have been worth it. And it is.  Our evening at Den was a blast. Inventive, delicious, yet somehow unpretentious food start to finish. Chef Zaiyu cooks with his tongue in cheek (google the expression if you're not an American or Brit), his sense of humor evident in every dish. It's playful, joyful, and surprising food. Chef Zaiyu, Noriko, Joy, Jesus and the team are in it to win it -- we watched them treat every diner to the same terrific experience, yet we often felt like we were the only people in the room, receiving their full attention. I won't critique the food other than to say it's worthy of all the praise, nothing is quite as it appears at first glance, and it will be a meal you'll remember. Den celebrates food and shows diners that high-end dining doesn't have to be serious or stodgy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r680744332-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,5,en
2019-06-09,scorpioshanghai,"This is first and foremost a Japanese restaurant and one that definitely is out of the box. The chef and staff have carefully curated a meal that is based on Japanese traditions and techniques but have lifted it to a fun, playful and absolutely delicious level. For those who gave poor reviews or did not enjoy their experience here - perhaps they were expecting traditional fare in a stiff upper lip sort of Michelin standard place. 4 of us visited and absolutely loved it.  There isn’t much signage so even though located on a main road, it took us a few minutes to find the place. Once in - the lady of the house (dressed in kimono) made us feel so at home. We were greeted like long lost friends and she knew all our names and where we came from immediately (details were submitted when we booked). We sat at a communal table but it didn’t detract from the experience; in fact it made it more fun as we got to see reactions of the other patrons when food was served. Every dish in the menu was given much thought in terms of presentation, taste and after-taste. The chef definitely knows his way around as the resulting textures, tastes and even smells were really spot on. Quite a few dishes had a playful take and suffice to say, we enjoyed all our courses. There is no menu or drinks menu; you have to trust your waiter who will recommend - be it sake, wine, soft drink. It’s a little discerning at first to not know (but she allowed us to taste before hand to see what we preferred) and even price wise - it was a surprise as you only know at the end when the bill is presented. However,  the restaurant is not out to rip you off so just relax, drink and enjoy. We found prices charged for drinks at the end to be quite reasonable.   Service was outstanding - informal, friendly and you were treated like an honored guest in someone’s home rather than in a restaurant. My only comment overall is that lighting in the restaurant is very bright and a little harsh. A softer shade and a drop in wattage of the light bulbs would definitely make the ambience a little more friendly.  Getting a reservation is not easy - you need to persevere and keep calling! Well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r680321946-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,5,en

Staff service was impeccable- everyone we encountered, including the Chef was beyond kind. Wait staff was knowledgeable about all the sakes they offered  & overall it was just a really enjoyable evening.   The food was delicious- including the things I didn’t think I would enjoy. I was expecting fried chicken with the Den-Tucky Fried Chicken, & while i’m still not sure what it was filled with, was divine. The Brussels sprouts & fish was delightful. Clam broth soup was also tasty, with many levels of flavors for a broth based soup. The Den-salad, 3 types of Tuna- all the delicate edible flowers that compliment each dish... it’s just all so thoughtful.   I would recommend a seat facing the kitchen- made the night that much more fun. Overall great experience.

2019-03-06,cctyu68,"Nowadays, the number of ‘ The Best ‘ lists, floating around in the culinary social media space, is quite staggering! Most of them name and rank establishments that are often quite controversial. Whilst mostly treated by serious foodies with a grain of salt, however, the number of followers using a list like ‘ Sam Pellegrino World’s 50 best Restaurant ‘ to augment, plan and select top restaurants for their eating adventure and collection of stars are still quite substantial. Participation by some of these blind-followers, tacked on additional layers of obstacles and challenges for those serious and avid gourmands, seeking to secure already tough-to-get top tables.  My Day 2 dinner will be at such a ‘hard-to-get-in ‘ establishment! Our venue, the Michelin 2* ‘DEN’ is ranked #17 on the Sam Pellegrino’s 2018 best list. As Tokyo top rated restaurant on the list and ahead of its compatriots like Narisawa and Ryugin, it’s ranking is even higher than a lot of gastronomic temples worldwide like Paris’ Alain Ducasse and Ledoyen, Copenhagen’s Germanium, NYC’s Le Bernadin, Chicago’s Alinea, San Sebastian Arzak….to name a few. Once again, a big thank you to my local foodie friend in securing this rare reservation for our group.  Operated by a highly creative young chef with a fine sense of humor, the restaurant offers a multi-course Omakase ‘Modern Kaiseki’ menu. Dishes crafted by him and his competent ‘ international ‘ kitchen team not only tasted good but also contained elements of playfulness.  Case in point, a starting amuse bouche in the form of a traditional Japanese dessert - Monoka ( bean jam filled mochi ). However, to our surprise, the mochi wafer actually took on a savory twist with filling of Foie Gras, Japanese pickles and Persimmons! Tasty and really fun to eat.  Another tasty and amusing offering was the chef’s famous ‘DFC’ – DEN Fried Chicken. A piping hot, super crispy fried chicken wing stuffed with crab paste housed in a ‘red and white’, Colonel Sander’s KFC lookalike box! Cute and brilliant! The ultimate finger food!  Whilst my home town Toronto has its own Susur Lee and his famous Singapore Slaw. DEN’s version of a salad, appropriately named ‘ Garden’, was a few notches more sophisticated and refined. Containing 20 different vegetables ( Daikon, beets, yams, Burdock and lotus roots, mushrooms, asparagus, leafy and non-leafy greens….), every component was individually prepared, cooked and assembled. ( Fried, grilled, blanched, boiled, raw……). The labor intensiveness of this dish is absolutely mind-boggling! Bravo to team work and the kitchen team!  Service was professional, helpful and lovely. Every one of our serving staff spoke English! Our main lady server, with a Sake sommelier certificate, was most pleasant and knowledgeable in guiding us through our Sake tasting selection. Some real fine, rare jewels were brought out for our enjoyment!  This is one delicious, enjoyable and FUN chowdown!......and only my second day in town!

2018-12-19,Arielle S,"We’ve been fortunate enough to dine at a number of Michelin restaurants globally (Japan, New York, Italy, Austria), and this one of our favourite experiences by far! We were excited to dine here mainly because of all the accolades this restaurant has received in the past year (named no. 18 in the world, no. 2 in Asia), and it did not disappoint! The vibe is warm and casual, in an open concept and fun environment — one pillar is covered with handwritten comments from guests, and one of the appliances in the kitchen is covered in fun stickers. The food is just as fun and innovative as the environment — from Den’s signature “Dentucky Fried Chicken” complete with a takeaway box, to the signature salad with a smiley face, it was so refreshing to experience GOOD food in such a relaxed environment. Our takeaways boxes had mini country flags, indicating our nationality, which was such a nice personalized touch! On a technical level, the food is complex but not in presentation, rather in preparation with simple and seasonal ingredients. We loved the soup with winter melon and pork belly that warmed your soul, as well as the rice with pork shoulder — so simple and tasty! The menu is slightly smaller than Den’s 2 star counterparts in Japan, but that doesn’t mean you leave feeling any less fulfilled. Beyond the food and the environment, was the incredible hospitality that Chef Zaiyu Hasegawa and his staff provided. At one point, Chef’s beloved dog, Puchi, made an appearance, and he was the most adorable thing! When service died down, Chef was cradling Puchi in his lap and it was so heartwarming to see his affection for his dog. We were the last guests to leave, and after we played with Puchi, took some photos with Chef, Chef himself and the entire staff (front and back of house), cheerfully walked us out the restaurant, and into our taxi, waving goodbye as we pulled away — it was such a touching send off! I had read all the reviews about how difficult it was to call the restaurant and make a reservation, and I certainly encountered that myself (I called 3-4 different occasions, 1.5 months before our trip). Eventually, I got through and connected with Noriko, who confirmed our reservation, and was such a delight in person!

2018-11-03,Car0line_Walker,"Den provides the most fun you will ever have at a Michelin star restaurant, or anywhere for that matter. Everyone who works at Den makes you feel like you are a friend at their home. The food is delightful, delicious and makes you laugh with it's cleverness and quirkiness.

2018-10-17,eddyautomatic,"We were excited to experience DEN, it being a two-Michelin star restaurant holding down the 17th spot on the world’s 50 Best Restaurants list. It did not disappoint, despite the arduous reservation process.   The highlights:  - The people. We chose DEN because it sounded fun, warm, and relaxed—far from the stuffy, uptight eateries we tend to avoid. From the email correspondence to the first greeting to the farewell, in which the entire staff stepped out of the restaurant to wave goodbye, everyone on the DEN team showcased genuine warmth, knowledge, professionalism, and hospitality. They took us through each course and sake sampling like they were hosting us for dinner in their home. They invited questions and interaction.  - Chef Zaiyu. Our seats faced the kitchen, and we were honoured to watch a master in action. He took the time to greet and interact with the guests. I purchased one of his cookbooks and he took 10 minutes after the meal to sign an elaborate message on the inside cover. What a star.  - Of course, the food! Admittedly, not every course was to my taste, but every single one was inventive, creative, beautifully conceptualized and presented, and like nothing we’ve tasted before. The house sake, which is produced exclusively for DEN, was the best we came across in Japan.  - Puchi, Jr! Chef Zaiyu’s pup has become something of an Instagram star, and we were excited to meet him face to face. He was an adorable way to cap off the experience.  - The value. At 20,000 yen, we had an unforgettable meal, far less expensive than other kaiseki restaurants in the country.   The lowlights:  - It’s not easy to reserve a table. And you have to duck to enter the washrooms. Those are seriously the only drawbacks I can think of.   Overall, I highly recommend DEN for anyone looking to enjoy a world-class meal while hanging out with a world-renowned chef in a fun, laidback atmosphere. We’ve visited many Michelin star establishments, and DEN is by far the most fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r625890706-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,5,en

2018-09-04,ryu0803,"We had the opportunity to try the food from Chef Hasegawa when he and his team went to Hong Kong a few months earlier. It was a cooperation event at the Ritz Carlton Hotel with Chef Royer from Odette, Singapore. We were very impressed by what he presented. We decided right away to make a trip to Tokyo and dine at his restaurant.  We are glad that we came because what we got from the dinner in Hong Kong was just an enticing trailer of a great movie. At DEN, we saw up close how the Chef and his team were working in the kitchen. We tasted the amazing food from the ever changing menu he created with the freshest seasonal ingredients. We also felt the genuine hospitality from his wife, Emi San and the rest of the Hasegawa family. And of course, we got to play with his adorable dog Picu. This restaurant is on the top for a reason and that is what one must pay them a visit to experience first hand.

2018-08-20,Peter S,"Was looking forward to the visit as I had read that Den is fun and the food is great. I really enjoyed both aspects, the service is attentive and really fun and engaging. I sat on the bar facing the kitchen so engaging with the kitchen was easy but as service slowed the chef did come out and talk to all of the tables as well.  Food wise, my menu for the night I visited (10th Aug) was:  Starter:  Monaka (Japanese traditional confectionary sweets) sandwiched with foie gras marinated in white miso, Japanese prune jam (sumomo), and pickled radish.   Second course: Tokoroten Jelly noodle made from tomato, served with passion fruits, basil seeds and dashi vinegar jelly  DENtucky Fried Chicken: Deep fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice and grilled matsutake mushroom  Sashimi: Katsuo (Bonito) from Shizuoka served with Japanese mustard (karashi)  Grilled dish: Freshwater eel (unagi) grilled with brush of soy sauce,  served with grilled peppers and grated spicy daikon  garDEN salad: Signature salad with 20 different kinds of vegetable prepared in different cooking methods such as  deep-fried, pickled, grilled, raw ...etc  Soup: Soup with pork and Japanese pickles - our homemade pickled cabbages, and Kyoto pickles ""suguki""  Rice:  Sirloin beef rice with 16 types of grains, served with Japanese pickles (myouga, cucumber, eggplants) and miso soup  Dessert: Peach marinated in mint, rum jelly and yogurt sorbet.  It was a really interesting menu, all great quality and excellent flavours but also very different for a fine dining establishment - less careful and more carefree. I really enjoyed all of the courses, especially the garDEN which is one of the best salad/vegetable dishes I have ever had. Drinks wise there is no wine list, you are offered selections from sake and wine per course and I enjoyed some very interesting choices. My total bill was far less then I have paid in other top restaurants in Japan.  I would recommend a visit and keep in mind the fun factor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d13237922-r608645279-Den-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,5,en

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit. In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved. Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen. The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques. We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet.

There were highs (snails and Alpine grey meat) and some other dishes from which I would have expected more (risotto), a bit anonymous (salad). A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing. Considering the important price of the menu not appreciated the proposal of historical dishes off the list with additional cost to add. Wide proposal on champagne, limited on Italian sparkling wines, mark-up acceptable.

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

2024-09-19,Egon70,"Amber is one of the French fine dining restaurants in Hong Kong which I go from time to time.  I was there for dinner with a friend (his first time to the restaurant) a couple of days ago. We both enjoyed our meal.  We took the 7-course menu. The 5 savoury dishes included 2 dishes ((a) the signature aka uni and (b) foie gras Brussels sprout) which were also served during my dinner in Amber earlier this year.   Other savoury dishes were: - Alaskan king crab  - Kinmedai (served in the kitchen where I’d the pleasure of meeting Chef Richard Ekkebus again)  - Pigeon   All of them were very delicious but the pigeon dish was by far the most impressive. The meat was of outstanding quality and cooked to perfection. It’s cooked medium rare but when I cut it there wasn’t any hint of blood. The small slice of flesh on top of the dish was very juicy and tender. Okinawa corn on the side was very sweet.   The 2 desserts weren’t bad. However, they paled in comparison to the savoury dishes.   The service was smooth and seamless. All staff were very professional. Almost 4 hours passed by easily.   4.5 out of 5 overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r970517160-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,4,en

French lamb which comprised 3 different parts. The meat was perfectly cooked. It’s very tender and juicy with a unique fragrance.   The dessert wasn’t bad.

2024-01-17,Jean Helly,"My wife and I and our daughter celebrated our 20th Anniversary at Amber last night. I personnally had been for dinner and lunch before, but not my wife.  The ambiance: The restaurant was re-decorated a few years ago and the new decoration looks much better than before. Newer style, very clean, the tables are very spacious. The restaurant was only half full last night so it was also very quiet. Everything on the table was clean and tidy, as it should be with a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  The staff: The staff is well trained, very amicable and willing to chat just the right amount. The dishes were explained very clearly and my wife (who is an excellent cook herself) was able to ask questions. Getting the attention of the staff was no issue.  Visit of the kitchen: With our Full Amber Experience came a visit of the kitchen. A nice touch that we appreciated, which I don't think too many restaurants in HK offer. Our Spanish Mackerel dish was prepared before our eyes by the chef with full explanation. We then had our dish in the kitchen while the chef was explaining to us how the whole kitchen is working. A totally cool experience.  The wine list: The wine list is extensive and comparable to Restaurant Petrus for example, and more extensive than Gaddis. The markups are a little on the high side compared to other fine dining restaurants in HK. I had chosen my wine in advance and went with a 2012 Malhadinha (a red Portuguese wine) that lived up to my expextations entirely. The glasses used by the sommelier were the correct ones.  The food: The menu is an absolute masterpiece. Each dish is extremely well crafted, the ingredients used of the highest quality. The flavours are very complex and goes along very well with the presentation of the dishes. 2 things to note: - the menus are entirely sustainably sourced and Amber gets a Green Star from Michelin for this. - there is a vegetarian menu option, which my daughter ordered, and the portions are meaningfully more copious than the non-vegetarian menu, similar to my previous experience at Amber. Not an issue of course, but worth noting.  Our Anniversary dinner was a complete success, and we'll definitely come back to Amber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r934542017-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en

We chose the “Extended Amber Experience” with four courses and it was sumptuous and satisfying.  We were delighted by the prawn consommé which was flavoursome, the tooth fish and scallop with was tender with freshness, the duck that was so gamey, while the signature Red Sea Urchin “cauliflower” lobster caviar was as memorable as our last visit.  The petit four combo was one of the most impressive with fruits, and freshly made Ying Yang (coffee and tea) mix.  Staff were professional and attentive, who explained each dish clearly; and the wine list comprehensive and advice was spot on - the range of wine-by-the-glass is large.

Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt. Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)

2024-09-23,Brian L,"My wife and I returned just last night from three weeks in China. King's Joy was one of our highlights so I wanted to write a review while our experience is still fresh.  Our hotel (Mandarin Oriental - stay there!) recommended King's Joy when we asked for the best vegetarian restaurants. We had no idea we were going to a three Michelin star restaurant nor what we were in for. What we were in for was a delicious culinary adventure with edible art and extraordinary service. This is a 100% vegetarian restaurant (that can easily do vegan if you wish) and will impress even the most picky of meat eaters. It is extraordinary what the chefs can do with vegetables.  First, the location is perfect. Just across the road from a Ming Dynasty temple, King's Joy sits quietly amongst a bustling Beijing cityscape. You could walk right past the restaurant and have no idea what was inside. It is a remodeled courtyard home from ages ago, and its modern elegance hides its ancient past. Amazing spot to eat!  Secondly, the food is as beautiful as it is delicious. Each portion is small but I promise you, you will leave full. The servers explain what you are eating as they bring it out, all of it local, all of it delicious. You get so many flavors and textures your tastebuds will explode in the best ways possible.  Thirdly, and certainly not last, the service is impeccable. Our server the first night, a *super* friendly and knowledgable guy named Jack, was as impressionable as the food and played a huge role in our decision to come back and dine there again. He spoke perfect English and was a wealth of information and friendliness. Should you choose to dine at King's Joy - and you should - request Jack as your main server; he truly felt like a friend and was a significant part of our experience.  Please, do yourself a favor and dine at this restaurant during your stay in Beijing.

2024-07-31,Jen C,"Big disappointment! I made reservation while I was in the U.S.,  suppose be a good treat for my dad who I didn’t see for 7 years.  But boy what a disappointment , first of all they force you to pick same price /set course menu for all people on the table, which is limited the option to try different things. They have 3 sets of menu with different prices. My dad was upset about that but I was still hope the food is good, but the disappointment continues, same material repeat on most of dishes, basically tofu, bamboo or mushrooms , tastes is not good at all,  I was really questioning how they even got 3 Michelin stars?!

2024-06-17,E. B.,"For my wife’s birthday, we wanted a dining experience as special as the occasion itself during our stay in Beijing. We chose ""King's Joy,"" a renowned vegetarian restaurant celebrated for its culinary artistry and elegant ambiance—think big plates, small food, live music, and everything else that accompanies what seemed like sophisticated dining. While the restaurant largely lived up to its reputation, a few aspects left us with mixed feelings.  Highlights  From the moment we entered King's Joy, the ambiance set a tone of serene elegance. The restaurant's decor, a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and traditional Chinese design, created a warm and inviting atmosphere. Soft lighting and tasteful decor added to the intimate and cozy feeling, making it an ideal setting for our celebration.  The food at King's Joy was nothing short of exceptional. The highlight of our meal was the ""Nostoc Maize Grain in Burdock,"" a dish that perfectly showcased the chef's ability to elevate simple vegetarian ingredients into something truly extraordinary.  Adding to the enchanting atmosphere was a live harp performance by a talented musician near our table. Her soothing melodies provided a beautiful, calming backdrop to our meal, enhancing the overall experience and making our celebration feel even more special.  Another highlight of our dinner was the waiter who served us. His English was good, and although we had difficulty hearing his explanations of each dish clearly (we were seated right besides the harpist), he maintained a high level of professionalism and courtesy throughout the evening.  Peasant's Sadness  It is at this point that we, the peasants, experienced sadness. Despite the many positives, our experience was marred by a few disappointing moments. Some staff members appeared to be amused by our attempts to navigate the nuances of the ""cuisine sino-française haut de gamme"" and our unfamiliarity with certain dining customs. As visitors from the West, this behavior made us feel self-conscious and somewhat uncomfortable (no hard feelings, ladies; just try to be a bit more discreet...).  Moreover, we were seated at a large table for six, right in the middle of the restaurant, rather than at a smaller, more intimate table for two as we had hoped. This central location detracted significantly from the private and reclusive ambiance we had envisioned for our celebration.  Conclusion  In a sense, ""King's Joy"" offers a remarkable dining experience with its exquisite food, serene ambiance, and delightful live music. It stands as a top destination for those looking to celebrate special occasions with vegetarian cuisine in Beijing. However, the occasional lapses in respectful service and the less-than-ideal seating arrangements slightly dampened what could have been a flawless evening. Despite these issues, ""King's Joy"" remains a worthy choice for a more-than-average dining experience.  -----------  在北京旅行期间，为了庆祝我妻子的生日，我们想要一个与这特殊时刻相匹配的特别的用餐体验。我们选择了 “京兆尹”，一 家以其烹饪艺术和优雅氛围而闻名的素食餐厅——想象一下大盘子、小食物、现场音乐，以及所有看起来像是精致用餐的一切。虽然餐厅在很大程度上达到了它的声誉，但某些方面让我们有些失望。  优点  从我们踏入京兆尹的那一刻起，氛围就营造出一种宁静的优雅。餐厅的装饰，现代精致与传统中式设计的和谐结合，营造了一个温馨而令人愉悦的环境。柔和的灯光和精美的装饰增加了温馨和舒适的感觉，使它成为我们庆祝的理想场所。  京兆尹的食物简直是无与伦比的。我们这顿饭的亮点是 “黄花菜玉米粒搭配牛蒡”，这道菜完美展示了厨师将简单的素食食材提升为真正非凡的能力。  为我们用餐增添魅力的是一位才华横溢的音乐家在我们桌旁演奏的竖琴。她舒缓的旋律为我们的晚餐提供了一个美丽、平静的背景，增强了整体体验，使我们的庆祝活动显得更加特别。现场音乐为这次晚餐增添了个性化和优雅的色彩。  我们晚上的另一个亮点是为我们服务的服务员。他的英语非常流利，尽管由于我们离竖琴手很近，很难清楚地听到他对每道菜的解释，但他整个晚上都保持了高度的专业性和礼貌。  农民的悲伤  在这一点上，我们这些农民感到了悲伤。尽管有很多优点，我们的体验却被一些令人失望的时刻所掩盖。某些工作人员似乎对我们尝试理解 “高档中法混合料理” 和我们对某些用餐习俗的不熟悉感到有些好笑。作为来自西方的游客，这种行为让我们感到不自在和有点不安（没有恶意，女士们；只是希望你们能更隐晦一点)。在一家像京兆尹这样声名显赫的餐厅中，遇到这种不专业的行为令人惊讶。  此外，我们被安排在餐厅中间的一张六人桌，而不是我们所希望的更小、更亲密的双人桌。这种中央位置显著地削弱了我们对庆祝活动的私人和隐蔽氛围的预期。我们发现自己处在活动的中心，工作人员和顾客经常经过，这使我们很难享受我们为这特殊晚上所期望的温馨、隐蔽的氛围。  结论  从某种意义上说，“京兆尹”提供了一个卓越的用餐体验，其美味的食物、宁静的氛围和迷人的现场音乐使其成为在北京庆祝特殊场合的素食餐饮的首选之地。然而，偶尔的不尊重服务和不理想的座位安排略微影响了本来可能是完美的夜晚。尽管存在这些问题，“京兆尹” 仍然是一次愉快的用餐体验的值得推荐的选择。",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r955513928-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,3,en

2024-02-15,Traveler2009,"King’s Joy is one of those restaurants that try to offer a culinary journey across their country, using a tasting, set menu.  There is no question that the food has been exquisite, and it does indeed offer a chance to experience ingredients from across China.  Also, it’s worth mentioning that the menu is 100% vegetarian!  Just like in any tasting restaurant each dish comes with a story. In this case it also comes along with an amazing presentation.    The wine menu is impressive as mentioned by many reviewers and you will for sure find something for your taste.       There are a few areas of improvement that I could suggest.  First off, having a sommelier available, or providing a bit of wine education for the staff would help – a lot.   Second, the food is really spectacular however some of the dishes would be even better when paired with the right drinks.  In my case I went with a Chardonnay that was great for most of the dishes, but some of the dishes clearly called out for a red wine.  It would be worthwhile for the restaurant to offer a drinks pairing menu. Third and last point, would be on providing even more training for the staff and improving on the marketing – the restaurant definitely has a story that needs to be told correctly. For non-Chinese customers, the restaurant should work a little bit on making sure the translation actually conveys the correct message!  At the end of the meal the waiter is offering dumplings or noodles.   The translation should emphasize that noodles at the end of the meal is a Chinese tradition – as you will see in many many restaurants. The waiter that attended me was speaking reasonably good English, but clearly not fluent.  His explanation of serving noodles, was to ensure clients are not hungry at the end of the meal….  With the portions being pretty small, it is possible that some customers could still be hungry by the end of the meal. Nevertheless, this is where a bit of savvy marketing would come in handy, not to mention that noodles at the end of a meal are the norm!  Also, this is an amazing vegetarian restaurant. Even more so considering it is located in China, which is not the first destination that comes to mind for vegetarian dishes.  The restaurant has some serious work to do on marketing and presentation of it’s story!  The setting of the restaurant, the décor, the service is very nice and comfortable like you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant.  Getting in is literally taking you to another world or peace and serenity, 100% opposite to the hustle and bustle of the street.  This is not a value restaurant by any stretch of imagination.  It’s clearly designed to be an amazing experience, and that it is! For me the experience was great, but not to die for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d3330316-r938452171-King_s_Joy-Beijing.html,5,en

At least, According to the previous mentioning terms , the only Michelin three stars vegetarian restaurant is an absolute right evaluation. Secondly, for the term of cuisine, the main course such as quinoa boletus wellington with red wine pineapple grapefruit enzymes is highly recommended, because, there is no difference between this & real steaks in taste & appearance.  Lastly, usually having fine dinner with wine is a routine for any type of Michelin restaurant, yet, for this restaurant, it offers different juice to service corresponding cuisines.

I had very good tea there and liked the decor at the waiting area. That's the end of it. The food was not the best veggie food I had ever had; the lady serving our table was the least to expect. Nothing rude from her, but just not that type of services for a waitress from this restaurant. Odd that all the other waitresses we had interaction with in that restaurant were all good. That lady did not serve our table only and maybe more attention was given to the other. I thought this restaurant was a competitor to Fu (Happiness) and Hui(wisdom) in Shanghai.

The fava bean was the one element of the recipe that I personally found to be extremely off-putting; otherwise, it seemed like a well-balanced dish.

2023-09-14,Molly S,"So, we really wanted to like this place. We booked it for our last night in Tokyo, and this was our first three-star Michelin restaurant experience. It was a mixed experience and overall a disappointment.  Service was overall excellent. The staff were very friendly and professional. The only weird part was at the end of our meal we felt abandoned. They had offered us hot beverages and we declined, saying we were very full and tired. After that we waited about 15-20 minutes for the bill, which didn't come, so I got up to see if we could pay at the front. When I got up someone did come over to escort me to the restroom, at which point I asked if we pay at the table or the front counter, and they brought the bill to the table a couple minutes later. They were very accommodating and called us a taxi which arrived just a few minutes later.  The ambience was really nice in the restaurant. The lighting was very intentional and the tables were spaced out so we felt like we had our own little corner of the restaurant.  The food was the biggest disappointment. Some dishes were better than others, but no dishes stood out as incredible. Most were forgettable, and a couple were just bad. There was a narrative/theme for the meal, but it got lost about halfway through.  We started off strong with crispy vegetables and dipping sauce--simple and tasty. The next dish was a pike conger eel risotto which was torched at the table, so that was fun and also tasted good--this was my fiance's favorite dish. My favorite dish was probably the salad, where they used 57 different vegetables/greens. I appreciated the story behind it and it was a fun experience to eat. They also brought cards that listed all the ingredients and where each was from. Most ingredients were from small farms across Japan.   After the salad, the meal declined in quality and also lost the magic of the story they were trying to tell. There was a bread course. I love bread, so I was very excited for this. It was good, but not great. The focaccia rolls were served cold, and they were a bit dense. They served them out of the baking dish, so I'm not sure why they chose to serve them cold, but I think they would have been better fresh. The radish dish, which they keep on the menu at all times, was ok. The explanation behind the radish dish was that radishes naturally change flavor over seasons, so they encourage people to come back and try it again as the seasons change. It was nicely cooked.  The next dish was a fried small whole fish (ayu). We appreciated that this was an elevated take on a traditional Japanese dish. We were instructed to eat the head whole and then eat the body with the sauces. I'm not a big fan of eating crispy fried whole heads of things, but that's just me. The head reminded me a lot of botan ebi, but it wasn't very flavorful. Unsurprisingly, it was a little hard for me to eat, and I didn't love the fish guts throughout the fish either, but I understand that's just a personal preference and we were there to try new things. The sauces were just ok. I have a feeling the traditional grilled fish on a stick with sauce would have been more interesting and tastier than their elevated version.  The next dish, the main course, was by far the worst. It was duck, served rare, with a red wine sauce. The duck was very chewy and I got a tendon in mine that I couldn't chew through and had to decide whether to spit it into a napkin or politely swallow it. I chose the latter and it was gross. My fiance's cut didn't have tendons in it, but it was still chewy and he had a difficult time getting through it. The dish was served with a side of asparagus with cream sauce, which was very mild and forgettable. I've had rare duck with wine sauce before, and this was the worst version I've had, but also there was nothing interesting about this dish. It didn't fit the story of the meal, it wasn't creative, and it didn't taste good. Unfortunately, it was one of the bigger portions of the night also, so I ended up not being able to finish mine cause I started feeling nauseous trying to get through it.  The cheese course was nice. Tiny bits of cheese with sauce droplet pairings. It wasn't anything to write home about, but I love cheese so I appreciated that they included some.  The dessert was a couple courses and was uneven in quality. Some confections were better than others, but none wowed me, and some were just unbalanced and not good. The drink pairings for the dessert course also made the desserts taste worse. At one point we had a raspberry grapefruit drink, peanut milk drink, and matcha on the table all at once and the flavors were really jarring.  We could hear the couple next to us talking about their meal throughout the night, and they were not having a better time than us. When their duck dish came out we overheard the guy say to his wife, ""Should we just leave?""  With the non-alcoholic beverage pairings, our meal came out to almost $700, which is the most I've spent on a meal, and it was certainly not in the top 100 meals I've had. I don't understand why this restaurant has three Michelin stars, and it definitely made me less likely to try Michelin recommendations in the future. It's worth noting that they seem to have roughly doubled the price of their food in the past few years. If it had been half the cost, and we hadn't gone in expecting a three-star experience, I think we would have had a better time. However, as it was, it was quite disappointing.   We still had a fun night, but mostly because it was a shared bonding experience of disappointment and trying to figure out how the food could be so mediocre yet highly acclaimed.  I am sure a lot of skill went into many of the dishes we were served, and I do think the chef/owner put thought and effort into the meal and experience. I'm not trying to question anyone's skill or talent, but the experience was not for us, and I would not recommend the restaurant given the relatively high cost.

2023-07-02,Elizabeth C,"I was lucky my friend was able to snag this lunch reservation for her birthday celebration in Tokyo/Kyoto :)  When my husband and I were visitors of Japan, we did try out another 2-star Michelin place in Tokyo...and it was regrettably very forgettable...and I won't name it or review it, which is why it has been 6 yrs since for Tokyo.    Not L'Effervescence!  I was very impressed with the very creative and sophisticated non-alcoholic pairing option that my friend went for - the other friend and I did a split pairing with the wine. I also appreciated the sustainability approach, with local ingredients.  The turnip dish was so delicious.  I know this may not be a huge deal for others who like their meat rare, I'm usually a medium, and not a brave person with rare poultry... it was the first time one of my friends and I braved eating a medium rare duck - and it was delicious. Usually, I'm the one a bit embarrassed & disappointing the server and possibly the chefs when I cannot eat the rarer duck or squab that is brought out, but to my surprise, I took a bite and finished it - it was divine.  In terms of cost and value, I would say it's a fair price and great value.  I guess I am comparing it to 2 facilities in California, and with the wine pairing, the California counterparts were more expensive, and I would only recommend 1/2 in California.   If this is your one splurge or one fine-dining French/Japanese restaurant, I would go with this.

2019-11-10,D Koa,"Some of the finest french restaurants in the world are located in Japan.  French and Italian cuisines are considered the standard for fine dining occasions by the Japanese, so I have been told by a Tokyo-ite. Choosing with French restaurant to patronize during our time in Tokyo was not easy since there are so many.    We decided on L'Effervescence due to the reputation of Chef Shinobu-san, who opened the restaurant in 2010, in combining french cooking techniques with japanese flavours.      The restaurant is located on a quiet street (I believe residential in nature) and the dining room has that calm, romantic, sophisticated modern feel to it.  The food is impeccably prepared and is delicious.  There is only tasting menu during the dinner service: Renaissance.  It is a 12-course meal comprised of ingredients that highlight all that Japan has to offer.    The restaurant is renown for its Tokyo turnip which is cooked for 4 hours but we did not find it to be a compelling experience.  It was good but beyond that we couldn't understand why this is the flag-bearer for the restaurant.    All courses were delicious; nothing disappointed us.  I opted to have the non-alcoholic fruit juice pairing.  I received 4 different home-made juices and while they are all delicious I would have preferred the pour to be larger.  Each pour was maybe 2 or 3 ounces, at best.    Service was very good.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff made every attempt to speak English to us and it was very much appreciated.    I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r725508317-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,4,en
2019-10-13,David F,"We had dinner with some friends at the start of our holiday, what a stunning meal to kick it off.  First tip ensure you go by taxi and give them the precise address as its in a hard to find location but definitely one worth seeking out. The sophisticated ambience as you enter the dinning room following your seat in the “waiting room” sets a high standard for the food to meet, it does and then some.  Quality of service is second to none and the tasting menu is a delight to behold, an example being the salad course which is a picture on your plate then to be told there are fifty different items on your plate and here is a list of the items. The menu is complemented by an extensive wine list.

We were treated to a Japanese tea ceremony and a special birthday dessert. The food was superb and the champagne the best I've ever tasted. We had fun with the waiter trying to explain to him that the dessert was toffee. Google Translate came to the rescue. For the first time ever I was escorted to the bathroom and the waiter apologised for it being occupied and directed me to their comfortable lounges to wait on. So courteous and customer friendly. When we reluctantly left, our waiter chased after us with two slices of cake. This is not an everyday restaurant as it's quite expensive but if ever I go to Japan again I'll be sure to invent an excuse to go back. Well done to all the staff here.

2019-08-19,StephanK723,"Amazing food close or at 3 star level for any restaurant globally out there. Perfectly combining Japanese produce with french cooking techniques. We enjoyed the lunch, which was a great deal at 10k ¥. Scallop sashimi, Tokyo turnip, Ayu in a buckwheat crepe, summer venison with sea snail purée all where outstanding. Quite exciting for me the freeze dried and fried Ayu for me, but the best in taste was the venison with the umami of the sea snail purée, closely before the absolutely balanced scallops. Just above almost every restaurant I was before was the impeccable service. Maybe we are not used to the incredible politeness of Japanese people right now at the beginning of our journey through Japan but this was truly world class. The wine is definitely on the the more adventurous side with lots of biodynamic or vin naturel producers on the list (especially from Japan). I took the special pairing and it was quite exciting. We are 3 1/2 weeks in Japan and they figured out a way to squeeze us in at our last day (I know, crazy with the choices out there, but we liked it a lot).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r700684373-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,5,en

2019-07-09,ted m,"Lunch at L'Effervescence, located in a quiet section of the city. Multi-course set menu the only option where the starter- a Guinea fowl jelly based dish worked well.  The following; maybe too twee riff on a McDonald's apple pie parcel was a bit muddled and consequently less successful, though still tasty enough. The following horse mackerel sashimi and noodle dish was a triumph and probably the best dish of the set. The signature cooked turnip a real disappointment as it managed to be both watery, bland and with an unpleasant mouth feel. The parsley sauce didn't work as a counterpoint and the Basque ham was missing in action. The whole fish and buckwheat pancake again a little clumsy and difficult to eat though had great flavours happening . The following pork dish was terrific as was the fruit based dessert. The tea ceremony finale also a nice touch.  Ingredients were first class and generally solid technique from the kitchen.    A lack of really good English on the part of the staff (otherwise very professional and polished) made explanation of the dishes problematic, though the menu card helped. A stylish and elegant room with exceptional tableware.  Small,high quality wine list weighted to high end offerings.... no bargains here, though the Kastelberg Grand Cru Riesling was a great wine.  We are huge fans of Japanese Chefs cooking in the French tradition.... built a trip to Paris around just that, so it was interesting to see what was being done locally by a Japanese Chef cooking more within his own tradition but within a European context. While not completely successful it was a very good meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g14129744-d3650658-r688259113-L_Effervescence-Nishiazabu_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,4,en

2019-06-12,ryu0803,"This is a stylish restaurant and we love the ambience a lot. It is definitely a venue to celebrate special occasion. Unfortunately our dinner was a bit disappointing.  Service was attentive but the young man who served our table spoke English with a heavy Japanese accent. It was difficult for us to get what he was telling us about the dishes and we had to refer to the menu frequently. At Narisawa, everyone spoke perfect English and it greatly enhanced the dining experience.  They served only the Renaissance set menu and we did not find the food memorable. The salad was made with many kinds of vegetable prepared in different ways. They even presented a menu with the salad introducing the origin of the ingredients. The dish was similar to the signature salad we had at Den but it was not as delicious in taste nor as interesting in texture. We were told the 4 hours cooked turnip is the Chef’s signature dish. It reminded us the potato we had at Core by Clare Smyth in London not long ago. They both share the same concept of turning something simple into gourmet. Clare’s potato was out of this world and we could not have imagined a humble potato could be the star of the evening. On the other hand, the turnip was just a turnip and the flavour was underwhelming. We also did not find the apple pie #38 with prawn and goat cheese appealing. The cheese course with 3 tiny pieces of cheese was also poorly presented.  Some reviewers considered the tea ceremony pretentious but we must disagree. We enjoyed the performance and it was unique and a very nice ending to the dinner.

2021-11-28,Whissely,"A complicated menu with some of the offerings not available. The place is extremely overpriced for what they offer - olives soaked in olive oil with a weak ""citrus"" condiment; oysters on the half shell with possibly the most boring sauce ever (green mamão vinagrete), raviolis no better than anything you'd get at Eataly, meat you could do yourself at home, pork with lots of fat in it - the Chef's ego is bigger than his creations. I will never return, service was weak and they suggested 14% when standard tips in São Paulo are 10%.

Small house with modern design, very nice decor and lots of room between tables so you do not feel cramped.  Very friendly staff, casual service.  Food is ok. For me the starters and mains were ok but not really good. Only the mushrooms were delicious. The codfish Salad was not very tasty. The pork rib was very greasy and not tender.   But what was really excellent: the desserts, the French toast was excellent, crunchy and extremely tasteful. And the Pingado, similar to Tiramisu, was absolutely delicious.  Small wine list.

2020-02-23,Kathleen M,"Too many Michelin-starred properties with public chefs seem to have lost the one main ingredient necessary to any good meal...joy.  Joy in the cooking, joy in the serving and joy in the eating.  Tuju got the last two out of three correct...but with a center kitchen on full display, the first joy was blatantly missing.  Yes, food is important, and with a 12-course tasting dinner with paired wines, there are a lot of details that could possibly get missed, but kids, come on, it's food! Enjoy it!  Tabled in front of the finishing kitchen watching the 12 or so young professionals cooking and plating, I felt that I was witnessing a religious rite...all choreographed and all so, so serious.  To be fair, this appeared to be a reflection of Chef Ralston, who visited the kitchen several times to insure the creations were perfect...and they were.... seriously perfect.  Chef Ralston, and his executive chef Rhaiza, have created a beautiful and serene space in which to explore his seasonal take on Brazilian cuisine. And 'his take' is delicious, intriguing, sometimes challenging, and overall a delight; and one that I would love to revisit as the seasons change, however... My visit to Tuju was a highlight of a Pinheiros neighborhood food tour, unfortunately, it wasn’t the acme. And it could have been with just a hint of joy-in-the-doing emanating from the kitchen.

2019-09-26,Michael U,"Following the trail blazed by D.O.M., TUJU by Chef Ivan Ralston pushes modern Brazilian Cuisine forward by not specifically showcasing local Ingredients, but reinterpreting the world through Brazilian eyes inside his Restaurant at Rua Fradique Coutinho 1248.  Open since 2014, and recently the recipient of a second Michelin Star, it is after passing through a hushed hallway that guests find themselves inside Ralston’s “kitchen theater,” a staff fluent in English leading guests to polished wooden tables that extend back towards the bar and urban garden on the patio.  A quiet and focused space in Vila Madalena, everything from TUJU’s design to Cocktail list indicative of a Chef who has spent time researching both technique and his culture, guests visiting for the first time are encouraged to partake in Ivan’s “Season Menu,” the carte blanche taking into account allergies and dislike but otherwise consisting of thirteen courses served across two hours.  Trained in the kitchens of Maní, RyuGin and Mugaritz, the latter identifiable in modernist spins on local Produce, it was while sipping on a strong drink of Gin and sweetened Acid that course one arrived, sliced and aerated Pumpkin forming the background for Peas and Citrus with herbs that carry over nicely to a “Taco” comprised of sweet Crab and shaved Corn wrapped in Nasturtium.  Continuing light with translucent Shrimp swimming in vibrant Broth, its follow-up a comparison of local River Mussels to those from the Atlantic bathed in Manioc Root Juice, fans of Uni will be stunned by tender Tongues amidst a tangle of Leeks with Parsnip Cream while torched Cauliflower finds itself the centerpiece of a thick Sauce that tastes something like Mole mixed with Soy.  Shifting back to Seafood, a tender Tentacle obtained through Chef Ralston’s relationship with local fisherman accented in umami, one would be hard-pressed to name a more interesting *looking* dish than Arapaima Fish in Seaweed Pil Pil, the combination of snappy Flesh and Skin Crisps equally tantalizing alongside Artichokes and Bean Sprouts.  Completing savories with grilled Tuna and two types of Palm plus unsweetened Açaí, a diversity of textures seeing the best bites those that incorporate a little of each into a single forkful, it is by way of Cheese that the palate is transitioned, the Blue and Parmesan-mimic particularly impressive, as too was housemade Bread and Butter plus the bright green Fruit described as a Fig.   Not scaling back on sweets, Dessert number one perfuming stewed Berries with Mint in a makeshift Sundae, it was while Coffee dripped tableside that a tangy Yogurt Parfait dazzled, the Pour Over subsequently enjoyed with housemade Chocolates filled with everything from Dulce de Leche and Cashew Fruit to Garlic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r713116135-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en

2018-12-15,CaliGirlSAS,"My husband and I had the pleasure of experiencing the phenomenal culinary journey of the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairing and we were blown away.  Don’t listen to any reviews that say that there is no soul or flavor in the food. It’s quite the opposite - we felt that the complexity of the depth and layers of flavor was perfectly executed and also appropriately balanced for each course from start to finish. We each experienced varying levels of umami moments throughout the evening and enjoyed the uniquely Brazilian ingredients that we would never get to experience anywhere else.   The portions were well thought out.  I’ll have to admit that we were a bit intimidated with the idea of 12 courses but by the end we didn’t feel too full or heavy - just happily satisfied.   I’ll also note that I’m vegan and my husband doesn’t eat pork. They had no problem accommodating our dietary restrictions. We also had the privilege of speaking with Chef Ivan Ralston towards the end of our meal - he was such a lovely presence and it was clear from our discussion that he’s in pursuit of excellence and innovation through his craft.   We’ve eaten at Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and have sometimes been disappointed with some restaurants’ tasting menus given that one or more courses may end up being bland or weaker than the others. That was not the case here - each course was impressive. That’s quite a feat for 12 courses!  For all of the reasons noted above, we feel that this place deserves 3 stars instead of 2!

2018-07-22,Renato Gama,"There is no way Tuju deserves a two star Michelin. We had the 12 dishes menu, and I might say most of them did not surprised me at all. I could even add that 3 of them were terrible. The one with Brazilian fruit “Caju” is one of the worst things I had in years. I could not complete the dish. Here are the pics of the dishes.

2018-06-07,Xicorea,"We went for our anniversary dinner to Tuju last evening and had their five-course Farmers’ Market tasting menu. We felt it did not live up to our expectations from many perspectives.  First I would like to point out what we did like. Being light drinkers, we usually have just one glass of wine each. At Tuju, the by-the-glass offerings were outstanding, among the best I have seen in Brazil. Our server was also very intent on making sure we enjoyed the experience, going so far as offering a (very good) chocolate tasting to my chocolatolic wife, free of charge. Finally, we loved the dessert.  The first thing that bothered us was their timing. Shortly after we ordered the meal, the server brought us some butter, olive oil, and salt – but no bread. We waited and waited. Some 10 minutes later, the bread arrived. They claimed that it took so long because it was being warmed up. Yet we have been to many other places that serve warm bread without such delay.  We have been to a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Brazil and abroad, many I have reviewed on TA. Something we always enjoyed at such establishments was being surprised by the unusual flavors, textures, and looks. Tuju mostly failed at this.   Our first course was a broccoli-based appetizer (Broccoli in miso marinade, cauliflower, and walnuts). It had a fancy name and description and the texture was interesting. But the taste was rather bland.  They were out of the second course, white clam. We opted then for octopus (my wife) and a couscous (myself). My wife enjoyed the tender texture of the octopus, but was unimpressed with the rest. I felt my couscous was nothing special as well.  The first main dish was a fish coated with its own roasted and ground scales, rather good. It was well prepared, delicate and very enjoyable.  The second main dish was a wagyu beef rib, with manioc flour and bacon bits. We were both unimpressed, unfortunately.  The dessert was called a corn-meal brioche, but in fact it was pain perdu, and a very good one at that. It came with salt caramel and peanut ice-cream. It was by far the best course.  In spite of the friendliness and proactivity of our server, we felt that overall service lacked the professionalism and confidence a place of this caliber requires.  The overall impression we had was that in spite of the elaborate descriptions and well-designed settings, the dishes fell short of our expectations. We asked ourselves how Tuju could have been rated a two-star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r585854760-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,3,en

2018-03-08,gibbyone,"The food at Tuju was fantastic and definitely the highlight of our trip. We did the 12-course tasting and each course was beautifully presented. Every bite danced on your pallette. Ingredients were fresh. Unique flavors were expertly combined to compliment each other. Some of the highlights were: the frozen infused watermelon cubes with cucumber and buttermilk, manioc tortilla with smoked beets, crunchy chicken and the lychee with thyme cream was out of this world. Staff was attentive and knowledable and capable of describing dishes and wine in English. The seating and lighting could be improved for more ambience -- the seating was a little stiff and the lighting was a little too bright. Cocktails were also excellent, but the wait for them was a bit longer than it should have been. Pricing was typical for a tasting of this size and caliber. I was also impressed that they offered a shorter tasting menu should you choose not to go all in. Eating is a wonderful way to discover a city and Tuju helped give Sao Paulo five stars. I would put this place on your must-do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r565284199-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en
2018-03-03,Ericapm25,"We usually have “girl’s day out” at a nice place to celebrate our friendship and all.  We picked this place because it seemed really nice.   It is nice but sooo overpriced for the ingredients. I cook ( not even close to a chef, just making a point about ingredients, complexity etc) and I felt the menu lacked the “wow” effect.   Most of us chose the 12 course tasting menu. One couse was split pea soup. Come on!!!!   The drinks were good, We were impressed by the mixology. Desset was ok.  The cachaça ice cream was really really good. But 400 for  just one good dessert and a good drink is too much in my opinion.  I recommend  going for the experience. Go with friends to enjoy, visit the vegetable and herb garden they hold on the top floor.

I opted for the tasting menu, which was a delightful journey through local flavors skillfully blended into modern recipes. The staff was very attentive, although I noticed that the executive and sous chefs seemed more focused on the tables of the celebrities dining alongside us. Perhaps next time, we can also receive a greeting from the chefs.  While I found it to be overpriced, it is definitely an experience worth having at least once in a lifetime.

The main reasons that no more will go there is that Mr J8 took the orders, charging « a la carte » instead of using the set menus & provided none professionals comments to the waiters (we heard & understood) to maximize our bill.  Definitely Mr Hakan that we knew before was more professional and this kind of behavior will only negatively impact this place.

2024-07-10,PelleasPhiladelphia,"One of the most amazing settings for dinner you’ll ever have, sitting amongst the gardens and trees and swarming waiters in white. The whole meal process feels sumptuous and decadent.  You can buy olive oil tastings and choose bread (if we knew it was coming we’d have done our cheese plate later), you have a couple of amuse bouches and then we did the ala carte prix fixe, sharing dishes.  Local wines and cheeses complemented the experience. The food though often missed the mark.  The smoked okra lacked flavor and swam in one note hummus, the shrimp in tangerine sauce was also one sweet note.  The oxtail seemed to be dry and missing all flavor. Often the dishes felt like there were too many sauces and too rich, while lacking flavor pop.  The entrees were the best, the lamb was flavorful and the chicken with corn pudding was the nights highlight for me.  Deserts summed it up as we couldn’t,  or didn’t, want to eat more than a few bites.

2023-05-26,Linda B,"I have been a guest of Od Urla since its early days. I've always loved their detailed presentation of dishes, excellent food, and synchronized service. However, my recent visit last Sunday was a major disappointment.  Our main course was served with little to no explanation, a stark contrast to the meticulous descriptions of past visits. The coordination between serving food and drinks was noticeably lacking, disrupting our dining experience. When I addressed this issue, a visibly uncomfortable and rushed cook was sent to our table, which did not improve our experience but rather detracted from it.  I understand that the restaurant industry has had its fair share of challenges due to the pandemic, but I believe that top-notch customer service and unique dining experiences should remain the cornerstone, especially considering the premium pricing of Od Urla.  Based on our recent experience, I find it difficult to recommend Od Urla to others. I miss the charm and service level this place used to have and I genuinely hope they work to regain it. Until then, I'll be exploring other dining options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2543601-d16659039-r892011982-OD_Urla-Urla_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,2,en

I have had the pleasure of hosting business and family guests in several occasions and can say that his is THE place to host the perfect dinner.  Highlights; 1) the booking experience, hassle free and easy 2) OD offers transfer pick ups for regular guests. A must if you plan on having some wine as Urla is notorious for police checkpoints and there is no taxi stops nearby (even though the restaurant is happy to organise a taxi). Being driven around in a Mercedes EV is ofc a treat… great thinking Merca and the OD management.  2) Arrival, top class organising and greeting… 3) Food, authentic with a twist. Even the top restaurants in Istanbul (and Europe) rarely comes close… 4) the service is simply impeccable. In a period where establishments are having a hard time keeping seasoned and experienced staff, OD somehow manages to maintain highly skilled staff with a huge smile on their faces.

Negatives: -There should be either more bathrooms for the ladies or all bathrooms should be marked unisex. -Music can make or break a restaurant and Kenny G. can easily break you at any location :) -We had the tasting menu. There is no reason that there should be 4 forks and 4 knives placed next to my plate. With all the servers they have, forks and knives should arrive with each course.  -Just way too many employees working. At one point I counted 18 cooks at the open kitchen :) most of them idle. -I am not sure what the seating capacity is but it felt crowded, tables very close to each other, at times felt like I was at a cafe :( -About the tasting menu; repetitive, both in terms of presentation and taste. I liked the SAR-MA, the mozzarella appetizer, grilled fish and the lamb shank. I can’t even remember what the dessert was. The red pepper sorbet is not my favorite. I would have loved lavender, rosemary or pine nut instead but that’s just me.  -I was really looking forward to the pasta dish. Even though it tasted OK, pasta was overcooked :(  Will I go back?

2023-10-17,Sarah D,"I also included a bit of our experience in the hotel review I wrote.  I have to say that we felt this restaurant wasn't that great. I also found that the restaurant staff were not keen to provide a great experience. Our best experiences were with the most junior staff, while the senior staff were some of our worst experiences. That being said, we never really judge a restaurant by the service, and the food is most important to us.    The food was not great. It's always subjective, but for the price, we really felt underwhelmed. The first course (Tomato) was our favourite, and if the rest of the meal had been as inventive and interesting, we would have a different review.  We also felt a bigger focus on veggies would have paired better with their branding around using the hotel grounds to grow local produce. Unfortunately, the remaining courses didn't impress. The trout course was okay, but foam has been over-done and didn't really add much in terms of depth. The abalone course was absolutely terrible; they were unable to tenderize the meat as needed, and the texture was a very very tough rubber. Our knives struggled to cut it. The duck course was gamey and tough as well.  The lobster course was okay. We had to leave before dessert (we had tickets to show) but we felt pretty confident we were not missing out on much.  Again, food is always subjective, and we are not professional critics.  The older couple next to us felt the food was very good. That being said, we have eaten at some amazing restaurants during our travels, and this felt a bit overpriced and uninspired.  We got the sense that this restaurant may be past it's prime, and needs some new management.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r921746454-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,2,en

2023-03-21,PaulMG4,"I wrote a very lengthy review to explain why the meal was very disappointing, bar maybe two dishes (the celeriac / truffle pasta and the dessert). They requested TA to take it down (don't like criticism?). But people should know this restaurant is in fact quite disappointing: 1) the chefs seems to care more about how nice the dishes look and how many different flavours he can cram, rather than actual test. 2) we were overcharged for a bottle of wine rather than a glass - this was corrected after we noticed but not even an apology. 3) after dinner we were completely neglected, couldn't even get a cab for us.

In an exquisite setting deliberately a little outdated with, on the edge of the restaurant, its English bar and its magnificent library, the Bellefeuille (place Adenaeur near the Porte Dauphine in Paris) also benefits from the ""protected"" environment of the Saint James with its garden that makes it a haven of peace. The cuisine is refined and if you want to make a meal off the beaten track you will not be disappointed. It will also allow you access for an evening to the very closed Saint James Club which otherwise is only accessible to club members or guests of the 5 star hotel it houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r956377057-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

2024-01-11,jcl75015,"Everything has already been written about the enchanting setting of the Hôtel Saint James, its bar and its restaurant, Le Bellefeuille, completely renovated recently. Not only are we outside of time, but also elsewhere. After the essential aperitif at the bar, let's sit down with the 8-course menu without counting the appetizers: three wonderful little bites that open the door to an exceptional gastronomic moment. It must be said that the restaurant has its own vegetable garden, in Nonville, which guarantees freshness, variety and quality of the vegetables served. The starter, a lightly smoked beet generously accompanied by small but powerful caviar, an unexpected “earth, air, sea” marriage of perfect balance, precedes an original composition of various mushrooms. The arctic char that follows is a marvel of delicacy, with a juice developing discreet aromas of almond and plum. Thanks to precise cooking of the section, it melts in the mouth and floats away like a caress. This is one of the few best dishes I have tasted in a restaurant. The lobster, always cooked to perfection, is enhanced with a slightly spicy sauce. Another classic dish: the beautiful mullet fillet with its golden, crispy skin which echoes the maritime power of the mullet flesh. Follows the unexpected squid, also melting, a dish treated in an original way with its reworked ink. Last course: tasty hen emboldened, discreetly, with a Chartreuse juice. Two pretty pre-desserts precede the magnificent chocolate and lichen pod, delicious, original, again a unique piece. The service is as I like: professional, communicative, smiling, precise, knowing perfectly the details of the dishes that are served. To complete this exceptional moment, the correct advice from the sommelier is a Chenin Huis Clos 2019, delicious which “resonates” with all the dishes. I was seduced by the clean, generous, original cuisine of Julien Dumas, whose abundant creativity and assertive personality can be felt. At Bellefeuille, it is not gastronomy that serves sensations, but, on the contrary, it is sensations that serve gastronomy. The promotion of noble products is always measured with precision, executed with safety and originality, without eccentricity, presented with elegance. On large menus, it is not uncommon to find useless ""mouth-hole"" dishes to extend the number of courses, or modest products (sardines, hake, etc.) vainly ""sacralized"", or even portions at medical minimalism, here, it's quite the opposite, we are facing a cuisine that is both artistic, which involves creativity and talent, and passion, which involves sincerity and generosity, gastronomy as I loves him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1096668-r933690113-Bellefeuille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

Very casual, very down to earth accessible with mind-blowing dishes with lots of thought, techniques and presentation both very old school and quite new school. Skill is not used for the sake of skill but to deliver the sensation, the experience and the emotion. Most memorable are the ‘ Broodje Paling’ and the ‘ Hunnebedden’. About the former: Based on local cuisine, the chefs personal taste, old technique, some table-side cooking and a very original cocktail this is a unique amalgation of both haute cuisine , Dutch Cucina Povere and originality. A very thought provoking take on eal sandwich. For me, this is Dutch culture at it’s best: Bravo!

2019-12-29,Sander1987,"We were looking forward to eating at Librije and would give the food 5 stars, it was amazing. We especially enjoyed the fish dishes and the duck, but the best dish for me was the steak tartare from watermelon, mindblowing how much flavour watermelon can have.   The reason we only give a 3 star rating is that the service was sometimes poor service. A few things happened that did not match our expectations of a three star restaurant and the price level. First, our water was not refilled automatically and after we notified the staff that we would like a refill of our water, we saw a waiter walking around with water and refilling the water at all tables except for our table. When our next course was served the staff saw that we still hadn’t got any water and then waiter came up to our table and said that there was a miscommunication and he asked if we want sparkling or still water. They should have asked directly and not waiting so long. Secondly, my girlfriends wine was served promptly, while I had to wait a while for my beer that matched the dish to be served. Finally, there was a mix up in the tea and coffee order. I got my girlfriends order and she got mine. Again, this wouldnt have bothered us at a “regular” restaurant, but it matters at this price point.  Positive regarding the service; Sommelier served me my  favoriete beer that matched our desert and did not put on the bill. We had discussed craft beers during the evening and he had figured out that I would really like the Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait.

It is all a question of taste, but I did not like the concept. You can hardly and mostly not recignize the food you are eating. All the courses were very tiny, in fact you get 15 amuses.

2019-10-29,Exroosje,"We visited the Librije on a saturday evening. We decided to go for the  8 course menu, as 10 seemed a bit too much. We asked for pairing wines, with a focus on red wines (generally you end to get more whites than reds otherwise) . During the menu we decided to extend with the cheese trolley.  The experience was nearly perfect (we only had to ask once for a refill of our water glasses) without getting pretentious.   The focus is clearly on excellent food, much less on posh appearance.    We started off with a few amuses and then Jonny Boer came with the first course (as it is made from eel and other fish from his birth ground). Then we got (a.o.) a crab salad, ceviche from lobster, a curry like dish, the famous librije egg with caviar, main was the dry aged duck and desert was fermented pineapple.   All dishes are served with a small card, describing the dish, to take home.  Interestingly we drank  a variety of reds (and a champagne from Eric Rodez) with the dishes, that still were dominant (shell) fish (sometimes paired with duck liver). But they were were a good fit, a Regent from NL (""Kiss of Therese""), South African wine made from portugese grapes (Sijnn), a Montalcino wine (Troncone), Australian Cabernet Malbec Blend. Recioto Valpollicella .  During the meal we got a tour through the kitchen and later also through the cellars.

2019-08-15,Mikexyz,"We booked the restaurant quite a time before our visit, perhaps 6 months. We stayed in Amsterdam and caught the train to Zwolle and back. The train is a frequent service and runs very late. The restaurant is a 15 minute walk from the station. No taxis in Zwolle was our experience so plan time for the walk. Zwolle is delightful. De Librije building is fabulous and I loved the art they had crammed inside. Lounge and restaurant spaces very different but decor fabulous. Table spacing in restaurant very generous so other diners not intruding upon our space or conversation.  Service. Almost perfect. Had to ask for water but only because glasses are badly designed and staff cannot see when they are empty. A very professional team and goodness they work hard. Food. We chose the seven menu. There are a large variety of options for your degustation which made me nervous on their part as I wasn’t sure why they wanted to tempt fate by introducing the complexity of so many options. The execution was almost perfect. Just two waits that seemed oddly lengthy when it looked to me that they were synchronising diners. Overall the experience from in to out took four hours which felt 30/45 minutes too long. Food. Presentation flawless. Variety of flavours and textures excellent. Food. Seven was though courses for us. We counted 15 dishes including all the amuse bouche and others. It felt generous. Wine. We chose the cheapest bottle in the menu which was recommended on the first page of the list. I was very impressed that the menu would recommend a 45 euro bottle. And of course it was very satisfactory. Theatre. Yes there is some accompanying theatre, colour and movement. We were very impressed both jonnie and therese spoke to us ( and everyone ) as part of the experience. We loved the kitchen tour.  Go to dish? For me it was langoustine so moist and flavoursome. Eggs, trout, duck and citrus all memorable dishes also.   Value. We paid AUD 880 (for two seven courses with one bottle of wine) excluding train to Zwolle which was AUD 130 return for two. Conversion rate of Aussie to Euro is 1.64 today. It’s expensive. Nevertheless I thought the experience was fabulous. We are both very pleased we went.

2019-06-06,Ohh Cuisine,"Three Michelin stars, a reputation of the best restaurant in the Benelux ánd a former designation on the list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants. We had been very curious for prestigious restaurant De Librije in Zwolle, The Netherlands, for a long time and now we were given the opportunity to visit De Librije with our team. Our expectations were high.   We arrived at the impressive property, which used to be a prison from the 18th century. Five members of the staff were waiting for our arrival and welcomed us in an attentive and formal way. We immediately felt very welcome. While our coats were carried away by one of them, another one took us through the narrow corridors right to the lounge area. Well, this space did not always function as the ‘lounge area’ it is today: it used to be a prisoners cell. It felt strange and exciting at the same time to be aware of the fact that prisoners – men, women, children – served their sentences right at this place where at this moment a festive glass of bubbly Champagne was poured to us before our extensive royal meal would be served. Kind of sinister, but interesting and enthralling at the same time.   In this mysterious room surrounded by lots of natural elements, we were pleased to be welcomed by co-owner and renowned sommelier Thérèse de Boer. Her formal yet cordial hospitality and genuine interest secured us of the feeling we were in for a perfectly organized experience at her restaurant. Just in case we were not looking forward to our dinner already, several bites made sure to make us salivate for more, under which there was a crisp of Mangalitza bacon and a duo of celery and gherkin with mayonaise and piccalilli. The taste of each bite was delicate and refined and the presentation of the bites was purely outstanding. You could notice lots of attention had been given to the presentation and use of colors.   Our experience continued by Thérèse leading us the way to the restaurant area. A playful, open and light space full of round tables with rough, leather tablecloths on them. The place where the prisoners could receive their daylight was turned into a unique gastronomic ambiance. A nice thing about this space is that during lunch, you can enjoy the daylight because of the glass ceiling. Big plus is that you can really admire all photogenic dishes with optimal lighting this way!   At lunch, the same dishes are served as during dinner. During our visit, the impressive sounding 10-course ‘Librije menu’ was served to us, accompanied by 6 pairing premium wines selected by wine expert Thérèse de Boer herself.   Concerning the food and wines: in this article we will not explicitly point out that each dish and each glass of wine was so well balanced and tasteful. They all were, trust us. And even though the one dish could be considered more complex than the other, all courses – from the bread with butter on the table to the friandises – were of high quality in terms of the taste of ingredients, the presentation and originality.   All 10 courses of the menu had its own classical touch.   At first, chef Jonnie de Boer introduced himself to our table. While doing so, he presented several exciting amuses together with a little card from his small and typically Dutch hometown Giethoorn. Something personal, we like that! The presentation of the amuses made it worth admiring them all for a while before we had the pleasure to finally taste them. The soft tasting amuses truly did what they had to do: making us curious for more to come.   Oyster, goat cheese and seaweed is what came to us then. An unusual combination of unique flavors put together in a superb way. For the ones with a goat cheese allergy among our team, a plate of vegetarian steak tartare of dried water melon with piccalilli was served. Besides the subtle yet full and fruity taste, the contrast created by the combination of the spicy redness of the tartare and the grey plate made it a dish to remember.   De Librije is a restaurant where offal is a frequently used ingredient. Besides a piece of brown crab in juice of toasted celery, chicken liver and heart of veal could be found on the dish served to us as a second course. Classic and intense flavors. A glass of Chenin blanc full of acids and oak flavors was served with this course, which managed to create a rich, round taste in combination with the food.   The same wine turned out the be a great match with the third course as well: a tender piece of langoustine, prepared as ceviche in a fermented Japanese tea, combined with tomatoes, kombucha and snake beans. The sour tea found its balance through the high level of acids in the wine.   The fourth course – yes, we’re not even halfway yet – consisted of saibling, pumpkin, lovage and a juice of sherry and almonds. Now, how can it be possible that we have always eaten saibling without any juice of sherry and almonds?! The taste combination was exactly how it should be. An excellent wine, a Mâcon-Charnay of 100% chardonnay from 2017 from Winehouse Jean Maciat in France, was served in gigantic crystal glasses in order to bring out the specific, nutty character of the wine.   Oriental scents were coming out of the open kitchen when the fifth course came out of it. A curry with monkfish, nasturtium, screw tree and pandan rice was shining on our plates. Delicious.   ‘Egg caviar’ was the name of our sixth course. This course is considered a real classic of De Librije. Lukewarm egg yolk with cream and a dash of 10 grams of the finest caviar on top of it – what is there not to love here?   Another classic on the menu formed the seventh course. First, Thérèse poured us a glass of Pombal do Vesuvio Douro from 2015, originating from the North of Portugal, which had been matured in wood for over 14 months. The wine went great with the natural and earthy tones coming out of the food: veal sweetbread with spicy pineapple and shrimps in peanut sauce. An interesting combination of ingredients that each had an intense taste on its own.   This dish illustrates one of the powers of chef Jonnie de Boer and De Librije: the ability to make dining an actual experience through providing surprising and tricky food combinations which can sometimes even be a bit uncomfortable. That’s when it gets fun. The art is to still let such a dish make sense at the same time and we think Jonnie de Boer is a true artist in this respect.   The eighth course consisted of ‘Ermelo’s duck’ which had been dried for two days, stuffed with hay and dandelion and then matured in parafine for ten days in order to draw the flavors as much as possible. After this process, the duck had been fried on its carcass and then cut in the form of a T-bone. Next to the duck, our plate was filled with marinated duck skin with meat offal in it, ragout of the stomach of the duck and a juice of fermented celery. Again, in our opinion this was an intense and deeply tasteful dish presented in a unique way.   A very interesting Macvin du Jura was brought to us to go with the ninth course: a traditional Macvin of chardonnay (non-fermented grape juice mixed with Marc de Jura) which aged on wood for three years and resulted in a fine dessert drink of 17,5% alcohol and sweet, earthy tones which immediately let us think of the strong, old tasting flavors of rye bread. With this wine, we received a dish of red cheese from the Bourgogne with chorizo, potato juice and tiny rabbit kidneys. Yes, cheese and rabbit kidneys.   A lovely intermezzo was created through introducing De Librije’s ice cream car at our table. We got to pick our favorite ice cream. All ice cream was homemade and inspired by summery blossom flowers.   Then the grand finale followed: a dessert made up of various citrus fruits, each in a different bowl. The first bowl was about salt. It was filled with orange and salted caramel. The second bowl had a sweet theme and had blood orange as a main ingredient. Sour was the taste of what was inside the third and last bowl: citrus with cucumber.   After our dessert, we were invited for a tour in the kitchen. It was impressive to see the hardworking staff fully focussed on preparing only the best for their guests.   Our dining experience – and it was an experience indeed – ended with a cup of fine coffee and friandises made by reputable patisserie Bontom, all nicely presented on wooden roots on a trolley.   All in all, our heigh expectations have truly been met. Dining at De Librije feels like experiencing a show: just sit back, watch, taste and enjoy the gastronomic ride. We don’t advise you to go here when you are someone who says ‘I rather don’t eat this or that’ in advance – but in case you are in for some surprises and oddities, De Librije is the food jail get entertained. Trust Jonnie and Thérèse de Boer to take you through the different spaces of the restaurant and be openminded for them sharing all the carefully selected fine food and beautiful wines with you. It’s truly a special experience, without any fuss, ending with a standing ovation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188611-d748025-r679525355-De_Librije-Zwolle_Overijssel_Province.html,5,en
2023-07-16,chloetula,"I told our waiter I would not leave a review, but I must warn others to stay away from tourist trap “La Table d’Hôtes”. I anticipate they will reply to this as they do to other negative reviews by placing the blame on one’s expectations with no accountability or offer to make anything better. There's no room to complain in the experience because you are sitting with ten strangers; we didn't want to ruin anyone's evening by being upset in front of them or abruptly leaving; I waited to complain until we were paying. The waiter did not apologize.  My husband and I live in the San Francisco area and have eaten at many Michelin and fine dining establishments, both in the US and abroad. I speak and understand some French, my husband does not, but I do not think that being fluent would have changed our poor experience.  First of all, I wish to be quite clear that this review is about the high-end La Table d’Hôtes, and not the brasserie upstairs. These restaurants being combined here is misleading.  When we arrived, the host confused our reservation and sat us at the brasserie, where we sat for awhile, unattended, before someone else came to our table, informed us a mistake had been made, and that we were supposed to be downstairs.  Our waiter had an unkempt appearance, with a wrinkled uniform and a gaudy name tag that seemed all very casual for a meal that would ultimately top 500€ for us.  The sommelier, in an equally unkempt polo and name tag (similar to McDonalds uniforms) who could not pour a pairing-size pour consistently all night with very little understanding of basic wine service etiquette, glasses on people’s lefts, rights, and not even all pre-set at the table when we sat down. There was a miscommunication and she thought my husband and I were sharing the pairing, which was corrected when she came back and gave my husband and I comically large pours. She proceeded to give us both extra booze all night because I think she wanted to get us drunk and thought we were uncultured Americans.  The pairing (75€ pp) featured the cheapest wines from top producers. It featured entirely white wines, with the exception of one red, which was a disappointment.  After the unimaginative appetizer of bread and butter, we were put on a video conference with Etchebest after watching a short, trailer for the restaurant. It was a strange, reality TV show experience.  The first course was where my path began to diverge due to my allergies, which - to the restaurant’s credit - were handled well. My husband was presented with a fried oyster, and a mollusk paste that resembled imitation crab. I got a burnt piece of root vegetable with a horrible combination of flavors in a foam. We ate, hoping it could get better.  Then, a tepid and salty mushroom soup.  Next, a small slice of tasteless foie gras enveloped in a brioche covering with a passion fruit sauce. It looked nothing like a recent picture of this dish that the restaurant posted on social media.  The fourth course was another diversion for me; I received two large pieces of a veal chop that were out of proportion with the fish that was presented to the other guests. My veal was cold, tough and dry. My husband’s fish was unseasoned and accompanied by inedible mussels that most people pushed around their plates.  The final main course was duck à l’orange, which may have been the only dish I may describe from our experience as tasty.  The two dessert courses were simply bad. A salted crumble with olives and chocolate mousse, accompanied by what I can only describe as a martini slushie. Then the final straw was a rancid burrata served with rocket and underripe strawberries.  Dining near the kitchen was noisy and underwhelming. I pity these young chefs who think they are achieving something by working under this self-important little man Etchebest.  The scratched Christofle silverware was a gimmick.  It certainly was a night at the opera, where one watched the performance of a dining establishment crash the lowest expectations. I'm embarrassed of our waste of time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r903607929-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,1,en

2022-05-15,great travels,"We anticipated an amazing experience at this very special place, but unfortunately it was disappointing.   First, I want to mention this experience is not suited for non-French speaking clients, and it would have been better if this information was noted as we booked this reservation.  The only person able to provide equal explanation in English as in French was the sommelier.  The experience is very long and feels dragged out.  We were promptly seated at 7:15 pm for dinner and did not have the first course served until 8:15.  The subsequent 4 courses were prepared and served more timely, until about 10:45 pm.  Then, the main chiefs left and we waited for another 45 minutes for pastry chiefs to serve the first dessert, followed by the second.  Right before midnight, we asked for the check, because we just had to leave.   The food itself was very well prepared and presented.  The asparagus, mushroom and foie gras were amazing, the fish was ok and we did not like the octopus course at all. The chocolate dessert was excellent.  The wines were mediocre, less than what we expected in this level restaurant, especially in Bordeaux.   This is quite pricey, and the expectation of special chiefs table concept is wonderful, if it would be executed properly.  The chairs are metal and not comfortable, especially sitting on them for 5 hours.  This whole experience would be much more enjoyable if it would take 3-4 hours and need to have better chairs and better wine.  Detailed explanations in English would help to attract non-French speakers. I would not recommend this and would not do this again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r838625686-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,3,en

2024-10-13,Jean Louis D,"After a very good welcome (invited at 7.15pm, we had to wait for all the guests to be present), we chained the dishes. Each dish is finished in front of us, showing some of the technicality. The catch is that too often there was a gap between the dish (lacking flavors) and the sides. Only 2 courses (out of 7) gave us pleasure, grilled octopus Basque condiment and elder sabayon, and cryogenic nougat pear soup. When discussing with the other guests, they were unanimous on grilled octopus and nougat, remaining divided on the rest of the meal. Picasso tomato (very graphic) to sauce with a brioche (very good) but unfortunately not accompanied by the flavors of the graphic plate. The mushroom pennes again very technical but the winey and alcoholic taste of yellow wine spoils the dish. The blue lobster cooked in salt vapour (minute cooking with Noilly Prat, very spectacularly), unfortunately not enough raised by a fish soup bouillabaisse style, the accompaniment offset from the dish but connected with the theme of Marseille, Ricard ice cream accompanied by peanuts and chips in the shape of a sardine bone... In short I would have liked less show and more flavors and emotion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187079-d17396510-r973699074-La_Table_D_Hotes-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,3,en

In addition, the concept of the table d'hôtes in front of the kitchens with dishes prepared in front of you in complete conviviality and transparency is a truly unique interactive experience.

I felt as badly as if a boyfriend had broken up with me. The heartache was real. Because we were three, we had to book a table for four, so invited a guest to drive down from Vicenza to take the fourth seat. A good thing, because visiting with her made up for the general ordinariness of the food. A good thing she and I shared one wine pairing as none of us found the wines to enhance the food, and there was no explanation from the servers.

2024-04-05,Jo E,"We were waiting 9 month to get a table at Osteria Francescana, the sun was shining and we had high expectations. Once we walk into the restaurant is when the fun stops. At the entré we are met by quiet staff in black, fringed suits and on the way to our table there is a faint smell of toilet and we are touched by the thought if we have come to the right place. We are directed into a dark room without windows and there is a beautifully set table. But it is no sound or music and the room is deafening silence.  As we sit down, a beetle drops onto the table from the ceiling and we joke that it's part of the show. Before we can take a picture, a black suit rushes over and manages to catch the little slippery sucker and escorts it out.  When we get the menue we see that it is dedicated to Bob Dylan and wonder ironically if thats why it is so deathly quiet… We also discover that most of Massimos signature dishes including the Five ages of parmesan and the Oops I dropped the tart, is on the a la carte menu only and not at the tasting menu. To say it was a huge disappointment is an understatement and our joy dropped like the tart. We chose the 12 courses menue because each dish cost 1/3 of the testing menu and we were amused over all the fun names.  Let's put it this way, the names of the dishes on the testing menu (”This little piggy event to the Market”, ”Camoflage sud”, ”Better than popcorn come Croccantino”) were more fun than the taste. Nothing stood out and best was the breadsticks and an extra dish one of us got due to allergy (we all four tasted, it was great). The black suits were nice and friendly but we were served on a rolling train so we had to buckle up. When we were waiting for the bill, we asked why it was so quiet. It turned out that they had forgotten to turn on the music and suddenly beautiful music started playing. Would the experience have been made better by music? Absolutely, to sit and eat in deafening silence is not a great experience. Our four hour affair with Osteria Francescana ended with a sense of unfulfillment, a dissonance between the reputation and the reality we experienced. The bill landed on 2500 euro for four persons and left us with a dull taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r945416339-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,2,en

When asked for the invoice/receipt we were told that the table was closed and we should have asked for the official document before paying! As we did not accept this situation an employee ( whose name I did not ask for and who, at this point I prefer not to include in The Team) adopted an unacceptable attitude.Nothing one could expect from any entity, far less from Osteria Francescana.

2024-01-03,Pat D,"Let me start by saying this was our second visit to Osteria Francescana, the last being four years ago. It was, and still is, a very memorable dining experience!   The quality of each item on each dish was of the highest standard, as was the extraordinary level of service, before and during our visit. I honestly don’t know how they do it for the money!   We loved it both times we visited and hope to make our way back, from Australia to Italy,  and visit again one day.  Having said that, I read, with interest some of the negative reviews on this forum. While I am at a loss to understand them, I accept everyone is entitled to their opinion. I suppose the reader of any review needs to discern the agenda and values of the reviewer and question whether they align with their own. Similarly, not all of us appreciate the same dining experience, hence we owe it to ourselves to establish that the offering is to our taste and budget, regardless of its reputation, before we attend and, most certainly, before we publicly review our experience.    It’s all too easy to be a keyboard warrior, not caring for the validity and fairness of our comments, or the deleterious effect they may have on peoples’ livelihoods and wellbeing.   This restaurant is not a one man band, it is run by a dedicated team brought together under the leadership of renowned chef Massimo Bottura.  I quote from a menu explanation document provided on this visit: “Alone I am Massimo Bottura; with my team, we are Osteria Francescana.”   Every minute we were there we could see fantastic attention to detail and amazing teamwork in action.  Of course, as diners, we only see the front of house team, but the impeccable quality of the  food indicated the back of house team was equally well organised.   A visit to Osteria Francescana is not cheap, but it is great value for money!   Do yourself a favour, if you enjoy high end, degustation dining experiences, book well in advance, and make the trip to Modena. You won’t be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r932170848-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,5,en
2023-12-19,Danilo G,"Let me first start saying that I am nobody, not either a food critic or a chef, sono un ragazzo nato e cresciuto in Veneto e che vivo a Miami da 15 per lavoro.  I came to Massimo restaurant right before Netflix hit. A totally different place and experience. Took me 3 years to bring my parents to the restaurant  to celebrate their 40th anniversary and let me tell you what a disappointment I walked my self in too.  Very Disappointment and kindly frustrated for what we experience, in a place like this I don’t expect, I require the best of everything, that’s why we have place like this and that’s why we go.   First in line to walk in the door at 12:30 and the smell of humidity (wet carpet right of the bet) made my parents saying 2023 and they use carpet? What a shame.  Sit down and no welcoming drinks, a place where you pay 325 euro for the experience doesn’t bring a welcome drinks to guest is seriously a joke  My family didn’t want to have the full menu and they pretty much force the whole table to chose between tasting menu or a la carte to avoid delays or issues when the place are coming out. With all the respect I have for the food, the art and experience but is not my problem. I am here to pay for what ever is available is your job to figure it out how to serve 2 tasting menu and 2 a la carte dish. Hate at Duomo and enoteca pinchiorri this year and I didn’t have any issue in ordering different menus for the table. Spent 1650 euro in wine, 2015 and 2018 sassicaia 1 ripasso e 2 primitivo, I had to call the waitres 3 times to fill my father glass of wine, no attention to detail from the staff. Staff is young and I love the fact is using the new generations but train them well before throw them in to the ring. The room is dark and depressing, crazy woman painting are in the wall without sense  Food was good but not stellar, at least not now. Half of the real menu is gone and is new creations with hints of Modena. I didn’t came to eat mini carbonara  I came to eat what Massimo used to serve. After paying the bill and bought 4 bottle of balsamic v. To take home, my dad kindly ask one of the staff if a grappa or an after drinks was offered saying in veneto dialect  My son just spent 3500 euro for food and wine can we get a grappa for free smiling?  The staff looked at both of us and said, sorry we don’t know and walked away.  Go to villa crispi, il duomo oppure enoteca pinchiorri if you are truly want a 3 star Michelin experience, here not sure what you can get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r930317271-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,1,en
2023-12-14,tracym88,"We came here last summer and honestly put off writing this review for so long because we didn't want to admit how bad it was... we were SO excited to come here and it was SUCH a huge disappointment. They had a new menu that replaced the revered classics that had been made famous by their extensive media presence. The culinary detour felt less of an evolution and more of a disservice to the legacy of the restaurant. The phrase ""that's interesting"" quickly became a commonplace across the pin-drop quiet dining room as folks said it to cover the disappointment we felt with each course. The dishes seemed to chase innovation at the expense of enjoyment.   The '5 Stages of Parmesan' (from the old menu - had to order it in addition to the tasting menu) was the only thing that gave us the excellence we anticipated.  The risotto was the other stand out from the day but beyond that, we really didn't like very much... We were extremely disappointed by the “porchetta” that was actually fish, and the “bisteca Fiorentina” that was cabbage. Not only were these items not what we expected but the execution was lackluster and the illusion did not hold up. The dessert ‘oops I forgot the Caprese' felt like a complete fumble rather than a delightful surprise, a sentiment echoed by others in the dining room many of whom took a single bite and left the rest. The service mirrored the cold experimental vibe of the menu and atmosphere. The robotic delivery of the waitstaff matched the impersonal atmosphere, devoid of the warmth and charm one would expect at such a revered place. In talking with other diners after dinner we were reassured to learn we weren’t the only ones disappointed. We left Osteria Francescana with a sense of unfulfillment, a dissonance between the restaurant's storied reputation and the reality we experienced. We have enjoyed fine dining restaurants and tasting menus in several countries, all of which we enjoyed far more than this. Overall, a waste of time and money.

2023-12-06,Per,"An ancient and wise aphorism prays: "" Create fame and then lay down to sleep""... It was an experience we both looked for, longed for, and idealized based on the Netflix series Chefs Table. To begin it is a paradox that Chef Maximo's love of music will be ubiquitously absent in his restaurant and, instead, you get an almost unperceivable sound of ""elevator music""; then there is the ambiance, the restaurant feels like a dressed-up cave of monochromatic depressing colors wich mechanical like waiters are following a script in a staged scene in a cult-like role-playing scene. And then there is the protagonist: the food... So many expectations to be punched in the face with the reality of the overwhelming power of marketing and the contrast with real life. The problem with sophisticated cooking is the same as in art: sometimes convoluted and complex images are portrayed as profound and abstract and those who claim to really ""apprehend"" them know something that is revealed to them but denied to most. No, good food is real, is passionate it should not be interpreted, it shall remind us of our own human experience,  it should excite our senses, and remind us of the metaphysical dimension that embodies human experience itself: the divine. The menu was pretentious, dull, and inconsistent. The service was mechanical as if the waiters were androids, not a warm, personal exchange. At the risk of sounding arrogant, we have eaten in quite a few Michelin-star restaurants and this was our only disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r928579608-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,2,en
2023-11-08,Sally U,"Where to even begin, especially after thinking long and hard about saying anything. I kept telling myself to just keep quiet, let it go…but then I think about others who might find themself feeling like I did after this experience— sad, let down, disappointed, and ripped off. I rarely write a bad or negative review because I know what it takes to operate a restaurant. I was a food critic in Kansas City for 6 years, I’ve written a cookbook, have a food blog, create recipes for an Italian wine club, and MOST of ALL— Massimo is a hero of mine. A food rock star. A giant, gifted chef and innovator. But, unfortunately, no longer in this spot.  My son flew from Taipei to Italy to share his 35 th birthday dining here. A dream of his, as he is a true foodie, having spent 3 years perfecting the worlds best  hamburger. Every year we celebrate his birthday by going big, and this year it was dinner for three of us here. The night before, we stayed in Bologna and ate at da Cesare, and enjoyed a meal like no other— honest Italian food at its best, served by the grandson of the restaurant’s founder, with a room filled  with love, joy, and deliciousness. Such a contrast to this experience in a sterile, quiet, somber room in which everyone felt a mixture of intimidation, loneliness, and expectation. The wait staff seemed aware that the food they were serving was beautiful to look at yet lacked all soul, love, and yumminess. One course— the main course— was pigeon breast. My son’s was okay, my friend’s was near- raw and inedible. Not one dish “ sung” in our mouth or imagination. Two of the courses were basically inedible. At one point, my son turned to me and whispered, “ Can we just leave?”  Why? Why has what should have been the meal of a lifetime ended up being souless? Is Massimo so distracted creating soup kitchens  and a restaurant empire that he feels those who can afford a $1,000 a person for dinner should be ridiculed by being served food lacking flavor, taste, joy, and — the most important ingredient of all— love? When we stood up from the table 4 hours later, even with Massimo visiting with us and being kind to us, we just felt relief that the meal was finally over and we could gracefully leave. He is a wonderful person, but right now the food he is serving here is unworthy of him. It is not art. It is not delicious. It may be innovative but it is not cutting edge enough to overcome the flaw of not tasting good. So, I have recorded our disappointment. At the end of the day, it is just a meal, but boy, did we have expectations which is maybe why we were so let down. The problem with being rated #1 is having to live up to it. Better to be da Cesare in Bologna and make people happy.

2023-10-23,LondonScott,"oh wow this restaurant has really changed. We were absolutely gutted. We came here a few years ago and had the best meal ever. Both of us are real foodies and I work in hospitality so we love spoiling ourselves and enjoying great food experiences. What a disappointment to come back and for the food to be so different. It’s great to see evolvement, but honestly this can’t be the same approach we enjoyed previously. The food made no sense and the ingredients didn’t work. The food ‘stories’ didn’t seem genuine and not one dish stood out. When we came last time we couldn’t stop talking about every dish, this time, we were just gobsmacked and travelled home in silence. It might have been our imagination but the staff almost seemed apologetic every time they placed a plate in front of us. I felt ill by the time I got home as nothing combined well and the flavours were bizarre. The service was okay but this is definitely not the place I told so many people about and sadly we will never be back. We travelled a long way to experience this again, so just feel we should have checked the reviews again before committing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r922605233-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,1,en

It was sparkling under the lights and absolutely delicious. Every course was immaculate, sometimes with flavor combinations that I've never seen before.

2023-09-26,AlanFinn,"This is a 3-Star rated Michelin restaurant and I expected near perfection as advertised. Much like a grand prix race car, no matter how beautiful it looks or powerful the engine is, if its missing a wheel the car is not going to do well. All the great effort in planning, design and presentation are derailed.  The breakdown from good to worse. The presentation was stellar. This is food art on display and worth seeing and is served very professionally with a staff that could not have been nicer, more helpful, anticipatory to guest needs. Bravo! Massimo has them well trained. And the sommelier could describe in detail every bottle of wine he served as well as the creative story behind each dish. Of the dishes served the ones that impressed us most were:   The lamb (unique flavor and complex), pasta al pesto served layered in glass dish, veal was excellent quality,  perfectly cooked and paired with several different colored food sauces on the plate (and the best of the food art display), the 3-risotto’s,  and  “Oops I dropped the lemon tart”.  Less appreciated was the filling in tortellini: average. Had better tortellini in Bologna. Slightly disappointing was the lasagna. The goal was to taste like crispy ends of a lasagna dish but this didn’t happen, let alone it mediocre taste. And finally the 5-versions of parmigiana :Too much cheese! (This alone with maybe some pistachio nuts would have been good for the whole dinner. Beautiful concept but cheese over cheese ad nauseum was overkill.)  Poor outcome was the veal Picasso-design food art presentation: it turned into a gooey quagmire halfway thru eating it  as the sauces blended together. The unique flavors were lost.  Beautiful design but poor in practicality.  Overall the courses were rich foods much like having 9 courses of pate.  The heavy cheese sauces on several dish after another, without an intervening break, was too much for the palette to take.   The dinning room itself was beautifully laid out but the acoustics were terrible. Sounds bounced off the walls competing with each other so it was hard to hear a person directly across from you. Very straining on the body as the course of the meal was several hours.  The greatest disappointment was the Red wine issue(s). Only one wine was red; a $35.00! Sangiovese. Slated to be paired with the veal, the wine was NOT at room temperature but chilled (one guest at our table likes it chilled), thus hardly much flavor. And when it approached near room temperature, the flavor of this non decanted wine did not pair with the veal at all.    There was a single decanter of red wine, which was grabbed by a patron at another table (he did not wait to be served as was custom). I asked for more red wine and the sommelier poured from another chilled bottle. I asked him about decanted wine or at least room temperature and he had no answer. He did ramble on and on about something but  clearly avoided this issue.  The breakdown from good to worse. 5-star: presentation of each dish. This is food art on display and worth seeing. -The staff could not have been nicer, more helpful, anticipatory to guest needs as well as presenting the dishes. Bravo!

Next time try making several small dishes of lasagna and serve the crispy ends only  -5 versions of parmigiana :Too much, this alone with maybe some pistachio nuts would have been good for the whole dinner  -Sommelier handling of the one and only decanter of red wine. A patron grabbed this decanter and poured it all out to those at his table. The sommelier talked to him but otherwise nothing else. This was notable for the red wine, see 1-star note below   1-star: Sangiovese (only red wine of the night)was Not prepared to be served! It was chilled (way below room temp, most likely 60 degrees) thus the wine flavor/taste had not opened up. Knowing he would be serving Sangiovese why wasn’t this issue addressed? As well, he served it right out of the chilled bottle: it was NOT decanted.   -So the  issue of the only decanter of red wine; what was the sommelier thinking/doing?   I asked him precisely on this point. His reply was weak and really did nit address my question. Grrrrr! -Lastly, the red wine paired poorly with r the fabulous meat once it opened up. I can’t believe how poorly paired this was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d1160010-r918623712-Osteria_Francescana-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,3,en

2023-08-11,Lee S,"I'll preface this review by saying I've wanted to go to Francescana for 10 years. Seeing Massimo Bottura on various TV shows, I was drawn in by his passion for Italian cooking, getting the best of regional ingredients, and being bold enough to present Italian cooking in a very contemporary way. As such, securing a reservation was something I never thought I'd do, so my excitement levels were high. I was fortunate enough to experience a 3* experience in February this year in the UK, and couldn't wait to see how the Italians did it.   The restaurant is set in a cobbled street in Modena, and as you walk in you are greeted by a corridor of contemporary art, and 3-4 FOH staff. We were seated in a small room (one of three, I think?), with 2 other couples, resulting in a quiet atmosphere. As we were introduced to the menu, the waiter gave us a small booklet contextualising the menu, and began (in Italian) to explain it. As an English person, my Italian partner stopped him to say I didn't speak Italian, to which the waiter gracefully switched out the booklets for English ones and without skipping a beat recommenced the context in English. Very smooth service, and it was a really good start.   For a tasting menu positioned as ""evolutions of classic Bottura dishes"", very few dishes felt elevated or exceptional. The three amuse bouches, with herbal broth, were forgettable, and followed by ""a potato wanting to be a truffle"" - nice enough piece of bread filled with a potato puree and it evoked the earthiness of the ingredients well, but nothing groundbreaking. If the dish set out to taste like a potato, it succeeded, but we never felt like we'd want more. The ""mullet and scampi"" dish was very fresh tasting, with lots of flavored foam on top of a chawanmushi base. The ""trout"" dish was my first highlight; blackened fish skin (in the shape of a fish) showed real care and attention, with really well-cooked fish, good saltiness and sauce. ""grey and black"" also was strong, and set out to invoke the tastes of the sea using cuttlefish and caviar. It did so very well, presentation was also very strong, with a cuttlefish mousse spelling out ""grigio"".   The ""caesar salad that wants to be a pasta"" was very disappointing; it was presented cold (surely this was intentional?). It tasted like a caesar salad but, from a creativity point of view, not sure the reasoning behind the dish at all, so it was difficult to ground myself in what it was trying to achieve. Presentation was poor, and the sauce didn't look particularly glamorous either. The same could be said of the ""tortellini or dumpling"", with quite a bland broth that didn't pack much punch. ""la vie en rose"" was presented as the 'main dish' of the tasting menu, and was a cut of venison in various sauces. Presentation was incredible, tasted great, and was a highlight. Oddly, the dish was served with a ""scarpetta"", a reference to a common Italian practice of mopping up pasta sauce with your bread. The bread was served 20 minutes before the dish came out, so it suffered by just being sat there on the table exposed to the air, and even then, wasn't mindblowing to taste, and was nowhere near enough sauce to justify it being there. ""this piggy went to market"" was the 'pre-desert', and was a traditional biscuit and chocolate dessert, shaped like a pig, and then served with a chocolate and liver sauce. There was a rationale to the presence of the liver as a homage to on a traditional blood sauce (sanguinaccio), it had potential to be delicious but the liver really didn't help the taste and it held the overall dish back.   The milk dish was the first dessert proper, and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Textures and the sauces were incredible, presented beautifully with a spritz of ""wild grass"" scent before you ate. Really superb stuff. I also really enjoyed ""bread is gold"", a combination of creams, bread sauces and flavours of panettone. It also contained some ""cotechino"", a traditional pork sausage dish served at Christmas-time. This was a direct replacement for the candied fruit in a panettone, which for me, worked (but was it necessary?). My partner felt it completely ruined the dish (others in the room had a few bites and left the rest). Finally we had a trio of petit fours. A lovely caramel popcorn lollipop, a ""micro"" version of the classic ""oops I dropped the lemon tart"", which was absolutely sublime despite being a single bite, then a pastry / bread traditionally made with rum, but in this instance, made with tomato water as an alternative. I really didn't like the taste, and was jarred at going from one of the best bites of the evening to the worst in a few seconds.   Service overall was very mixed despite the strong start. Introductions to the dishes seemed overly rehearsed and stilted, and I never got the feeling that the FOH staff really believed that they were serving food from one of the best restaurants in the world. I clumsily dropped one of the first dishes by the side of my plate, leaving some breadcrumbs. We overheard one of the more senior FOH staff advise a more junior member to clear it up, which didn't happen. That same junior member also came over to top up our water. My partner felt having the glass refilled every three sips was quite overbearing and interrupted the flow of the conversation way too often, especially in a small room. She decided to fill her own glass to avoid it being filled as often as it was happening. When eventually the water run out, the waiter came over and, realising the bottle was already empty, tutted and gestured to me, as if I'd caused a problem. He of course went to get a new bottle, but it was a very bizarre interaction and made us feel uncomfortable. Lastly, toward the end, other tables were asked how their meal was, given opportunity to share their favourite dishes and interact with the FOH staff. We weren't offered such an opportunity, just given the bill, which we paid. On the way out, one of the more engaging FOH staff did ask us, but it was another inconsistency I wasn't expecting.   Personally, this level of attention to detail isn't something I lose sleep over, or feel compelled to call out in the moment. That said, I've been in other restaurants (some starred, others not), whereby a quick clear down of any crumbs or remnants happens between every course, and there's regular check-ins on how you found the dishes, often resulting in a personal conversation about each dish throughout the evening.  Others have Aset a standard of service that Francescana didn't meet, in my view.  I would be interested to see if the Michelin guides have a similar experience when reviewing their status this year.   While having a handful of really strong dishes demonstrated the skill of the kitchen and the cooking, it also further exposed the lacklustre feeling I had with the remainder. It felt often that the dish was designed with the gimmick in mind, forgetting the importance of flavour and precision cooking at a 3* level. The menu felt preoccupied with trying to reinvent a load of classic dishes that didn't need reinventing. Ultimately if Massimo Bottura wants to challenge himself and his chefs and keep evolving and doing something differently, that's his prerogative to do so, and something you'd expect at this level. However, this menu didn't hit the mark at all and seemed focused purely on cheeky nods and winks to the dishes that put Francescana on the map, rather than keeping it on the map for the reason you're there: impeccable food.

2023-08-08,jett123,"This is our second time here with 8 years in between and it went from being the best restaurant to a pretty average (and very expensive dine). Last time Massimo was cooking and here and greeting. This time, he was around but with reporters and had no interest to say hello even from a distance. The waiting staff were utterly miserable and seemed like students on their summer break helping out. They must be happy as I have seen them happy on instagram so why the grim faces. The tables ate set so that you awkwardly look at other guests/tables and the silence is bizarre.  Down the road there is the most incredible restaurant where the staff and the chef are fabulous and Nonna actually comes out and greets people still, every night.. It is called Antica Moka so dont bother with here, instead have an utter blast for a fraction of the price and go there.

2023-07-31,rickpoet,"It was a dream come true to visit Osteria Francescana after seeing it and Massimo Bottura highlighted in many food programs over the years. We scored a reservation the minute they opened up (and glad we did as a few minutes later, all of the reservations for this month were gone...and this was about 6 months in advance.) With such a sought after place, make sure you put a lot of advanced thought into coming here or you just won't get in.  Honestly it was the Five Ages of Parmesan Cheese dish that brought us here. We added that to the tasting menu (after mortgaging our house to be able to afford this meal) and it was for sure the highlight of our tasting experience.  We enjoyed many other things, especially the incredible amount of artistry that went into each dish and its presentation. We especially remember the beet dish. We're vegetarians so got a vegetarian version of the tasting menu and they did, we think, a pretty good job of matching up flavor profiles with the meat versions of the dishes they came with. We also thought the Eggplant all San Domenico was one of the best presentations, taste and texture of eggplant we've ever had.  The atmosphere was a little bit of a bummer...it was INCREDIBLY FORMAL AND SERIOUS to be in there. The staff in particular, I don't think ever smiled, and the overall ambiance was kind of heavy. I guess this makes sense for one of the most famous fine-dining restaurants in the world, but it didn't quite match the playfulness of Botturo's on-screen personality, or the same playfulness that went into the naming of the dishes.  And although we enjoyed everything, even a few weeks later with pictures of everything, it's hard to pull out highlights...maybe because the meal had so many courses...just thinking about it, it kind of all ran together...whereas at many other restaurants we dined at throughout Italy on this vacation, we can call out specific tastes flavors and joy at being in the places.  If we were to do it again we would just order a-la carte. The 5 Ages of Parmesan dish that brought us in wasn't included in the tasting menu and we would have been VERY happy with it and a couple other items and the food, likely would have been more memorable and we would have saved hundreds of dollars.  Massimo...you're a super-fun guy.

The wine menu was presented first by - we suppose - the sommelier but suddenly they changed to another more junior person. It contained only portugese wines, but nothing extraordinary. It was also ridiculously expensive. The service was also very slow - we can´t understand why.

2024-10-28,Magnus B,"This review is based on ""value for money"". We paid EUR 500 per person for an experience at a two-star Michelin restaurant and Il Gallo D'oro is way off the mark. I've eaten at restaurants with one, two or three stars before, and this place is well below par.  The ambiance in the place is horrible. It feels like a conference room at the hotel where they have put a few tables. No thought has been put into creating an atmosphere worthy of a two-star restaurant.  The service is slightly below ""adequate"". The staff go through the moves in a slightly robotic fashion. No genuine feeling at all. The chef made an appearance without seeming to be interested in whether we liked the food or not. He had been told to be there, so he was.  The presentation of the food is very good and lives up to the two stars. Almost every dish is beautiful to look at and the looks are imaginative.  The dishes taste OK, but not more. A few of them are good, but the rest of them are below what you would expect from a two-star restaurant. Of course they are better than at a regular restaurant, but you expect more from a restaurant where you pay EUR 500 per person. Also, there is way too little food. I would not expect to have to eat a double-serving of bread to feel full. All dishes are VERY small. After all, I don't expect to have to go to McDonalds after paying so much for food.  Good value for money? Absolutely not and stay away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r977037006-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,1,en

Tasting menu covered a range of delicious options - all well presented with descriptions of chefs thinking behind every serving. I do agree with comments made by previous reviewers in that t shirts and shorts worn by guests is inappropriate. There is also a sign indicating that mobile phones should be on silent but this is ignored by some guests and not addressed by any of the numerous staff.

2024-06-15,Trek401987,"Everything is subjective, but we honestly do not understand why this restaurant gets good reviews. It is stuffy and overpriced.   The food looks beautiful, but the taste is nothing special, especially considering the number of fabulous restaurants on the Island that are a fraction of the price.  It has held its 2 stars for a long period, so perhaps it was just us, and many people we spoke with had been many times before.  There is little atmosphere. Everyone has to whisper. The window seats are great until it gets dark and then all you see is a reflection of yourself as there is no lighting outside. You cannot use the terrace until July!   The servers are amazing, and explain the food and wines very well. It was just the food, whilst looking amazing, was just bland.   As I said at the beginning of this review - everything is subjective, but if you are in doubt, don't spend the money to come here - go to one of the local restaurants that have a great atmosphere, are more romantic in terms of setting, and have arguably better tasting food.

From the initial contact, every server introduced themselves. We were presented a beautiful black envelope with our moments journey.

The chef introduced himself to us and was friendly . The food was sublime - honestly, sublime!!!! The desert carousel is such a lovely touch!

2024-02-22,Simon Smart,"Stepping into Il Gallo d'Oro, located in the Cliff Hotel, we immediately sensed that we were in for a culinary experience unlike any other. The ambiance exuded elegance and sophistication. Only about 15 tables and everyone dressed impeccably. Yes, it is an expensive restaurant but well worth every Euro. We decided not to go for the Tasting Menu but opted for the A La Carte choice. The meal began with a delightful Couvert, offering a selection of breads accompanied by an assortment of four butter flavours: regular, black octopus ink, garlic, and Madeira red wine, along with some local olive oil. This thoughtful introduction showcased the restaurant's commitment to creativity and attention to detail. We were then presented with an amuse-bouche of espada with onions and red pepper. The delicate flavours of the espada, combined with the sweetness of the onions and the red pepper were amazing. For starters, we went for the lobster avocado cannelloni with gazpacho pearls and caviar. Each bite was a was a taste explosion. For the main course, my wife opted for the pigeon smoked with eucalyptus and cinnamon, while I chose the dover sole steak with tortellini and a prawn bisque sauce. The pigeon was presented within a box that when opened filled the place with its smoky aroma and subtle hints of eucalyptus. The sole was so tender and the sauce so flavoursome. For dessert I had the biscuit box and my wife the daisy. Throughout our dining experience, the service at Il Gallo d'Oro was impeccable. All the staff were attentive and knowledgeable, even the Host, ensuring that every aspect of our meal was flawlessly executed and that we felt truly pampered from start to finish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r939389668-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,5,en
2023-12-31,SKGEmmanuel,"I wish I could rank them higher, but I cannot justify anything beyond that.  We opted for the Terroir Experience (11 moments) with champagne, wines, and drinks.  On the positives, the sommelier was extremely professional, knowledgeable and pleasant to interact with. Our wine was corked (which happens, it’s just naturally and inevitable), but he dealt with it very well and with such a natural response that was pure joy to observe, very professional.  However, the service by the servers was not immaculate and to the level reasonably expected in a stared restaurant, and there were weaknesses (though not for a single moment would I doubt the best intentions of the personnel, who were pleasant and nice, but simply not adequate for a stared restaurant, so it is assumed to be a matter of training).  Food-wise, while I recognise that it is subjective, compared to other stared restaurants we have visited before, I can understand how 1 star could be warranted. However I simply cannot justify 2 stars on any front, and it felt like there were some issues on consistency and execution was some way away from perfection. Same goes for the price-tag, which does not feel like it is proportionately supported by the substance and quality of the dishes.   Therefore, while I am pleased to have tried this restaurant, I am not currently in a position to recommend it as a stared restaurant that is worth a visit. Equally, I would not class it as a value-for-money restaurant, in the sense that you do not get adequate return for the prices charged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189167-d1427159-r931846047-Il_Gallo_D_oro-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,3,en

One of the party is a coeliac, I  checked that their website was able to cater for her  and also emailed for confirmation that it was OK. On the night, they simply  removed any sauces from the menu ( we all had the 8 course tasting  225  euro menu), and her gluten free bread had the texture and appearance of profiteroles, hollow inside. Given that the hotel that we are staying in can prepare a daily breakfast basket of many diferent kinds of breads and pastries and cakes, this and the missing sauces made her feel not particularly welcomed . The staff are lovely and very attentive, but as the host I could just feel the whole celebratory evening slipping away,  and would say that it was a very disappointing evening not just for her but the various dishes were confused with perhaps simply too many elements on them. I don't regularly do reviews and when I do it's usually because we've had such a great meal, but today is simply because it wasn't great, it used to be , and maybe the mantra   ' less is more' could be considered going forward, but I probably won't be there to find out.

You can see a lot of thought is given to every aspect of the meal but I would argue the appearance of everything takes precedence over the taste of the food.   The non alcoholic pairing was enjoyable with different juices, kombuchas and teas.   Everything is played beautifully, the interior of the restaurant is visually pleasing too. However, taste is a crucial part of a tasting menu and unfortunately this fell VERY short for us.  all of the dishes are very vinegary and they made a big spectacle about using scoby (the mushroom on top of kombucha) as they key ingredient in a few dishes and it is actually pretty foul.  Also,  upon reflection the service felt overbearing at times.   This isn’t about eating tasty enjoyable food, it’s about pushing boundaries and I appreciate that to a certain degree but it’s definitely not for everyone.  There are much more enjoyable food experiences to be had in Copenhagen.

2024-07-23,RorschAch,"The influence of the three-star Michelin restaurant Noma in Denmark even goes beyond the Danish capital. René Redzepi, the founder and head chef of Noma, is considered an influential chef in the world (see the notes in the same category for personal experience) and was selected as the cover character of Time magazine in 2012. His influence on Nordic cooking covers five Nordic countries, such as the newly promoted three-star Michelin restaurant Jordnær and the one-star Michelin restaurant Dill in Iceland. In addition, as a restaurant itself, it has won numerous awards, and the most notable one is that it was ranked first in the list five times in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2021. At the end of 2016, René Redzepi decided to close the restaurant and move it to a new location. He felt that the restaurant was a bit stagnant and the team needed to innovate further, which was a big risk and controversy for the award-winning chef. Fortunately, the new Noma 2.0 has received positive reviews from almost all critics around the world since its opening, including but not limited to The LA Times, The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal.  Scandina-vian cooking methods are derived from their traditions, such as the Vikings' need to use methods such as preservation, drying, smoking, salting, and pickling to ensure that they can survive the long winter, and this tradition continues to this day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r960870751-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,5,en

There was no proper presentation of the wine, e.g. why there were chosen to pair those 2-3 courses, fir which they were offered. It seemed a bit ad hoc. And very expensive for the quality.  The service was very efficient, but still not very personal, except for being offered some pretty average cocktails at the end for not so average prices.

2023-12-15,Martin L,"I am sorry to say but Noma does not meet expectations at all. One dish of 18 stands out while 17 were mediocre.

2023-09-09,Helmut,"noma has been on my bucket list for a few years, but it has eluded me due to the sheer impossibility of getting a table. Courtesy of a dear someone who seems to be a reservation ninja, I was able to eat at a shared table. The place is gorgeous and the setting quaint. Service is friendly and attentive, i.e., 3 star worthy. The food, however, was a huge letdown. The vegetable menu was just not enough to satiate a child. The main was a single mushroom (!). Some of the flavors were plain odd. Mind you, I know my food. Just look at all my other reviews. The wine pairing was exotic. But exotic does not mean good either. Some drops were good, others tasted like cat p*ss. I feel arrogance has creeped into the experience. The chef resting on his laurels has decided to make a mockery of diners it seems. While I do appreciate the art of making amazing food, it also has to be good. And this, unfortunately was a bit of a hit and miss. Go ahead noma, close down sooner than later. Make space for more passionate chefs who actually want to wow their diners with flavors and not ""concepts.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189541-d694971-r915704600-Noma-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,3,en

Glass of top Chenin to round off the night. Suggested by the Sommelier. Really happy that they did not push the wine menu although some of the wines on the menu on offer seemed quite interesting.  Service: Relaxed. Too relaxed for my taste but friendly, polite and welcoming. Experience: beautiful location, amazing entrance, original interior, good development in the menu.

Whilst it delivered on presentation and conception, it fell short on flavour and texture (except reindeer’s heart which was masterful in preparation).

All fine...it is a very old building. They serve mainly local and seasonal food, which I very much appriciate. I selected a five course dinner, which started with four different starters, of which all of them were on the very sour side. The individual taste of each ingredients was noticeable on the tongue and palate for a very short time, if at all ...the only thing which lasted was the sour taste....till the next course....same again.. The main courses were ok, but far away from what I would call 3 michelin star quality. On all tables, next to me, people were eating a lot of bread offered aside.... if I write a lot ... real a lot.

When the chef came to the table at the end it reflected the service, seemed a chore rather than a pleasure, better not to come at that point.

The experience starts with very moody, spot lights-lit tables and just the best restaurant staff I have ever come across. Guests are treated with wonderful attention, just as one would expect in perfection obsessed Switzerland.  The dishes are an homage to the area but put together with amazing creativity. The sweetbread surprise dish was just perfect. And when the steaming bread arrives with the sea salt butter, it’s culinary heaven. The wine pairings have certainly been given much and thorough thought but cold-served red wine might not be to every wine lover’s taste.

2020-01-18,DvA,"Andreas Caminada is Switzerland's most famous chef, so of course we had heard a lot about his restaurant before we finally made it up to a remote little village in Grison for an extended lunch at Schloss Schauenstein. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We were overwhelmed by the quality and the creativeness of the food, even before we got to the first main course. Caminada starts his menu with plenty of outstanding amuse bouches and appetisers before serving several larger courses. He refrains from using posh ingredients like caviar, wagyu beef or foie gras. Instead, all the dishes are inspired by local produce and recipes. Nevertheless, the combinations of flavours are just heavenly. And on top of it, each plate looks like a wonderful piece of art. The cheese course is another highlight: next to an exclusive selection of Swiss and French cheese, a broad range of side dishes makes for an unmatched variety of exciting flavours to finish off the savoury part of the meal. Of course, there are several sweet courses too. The best of which, in our case, was an extremely fluffy and delicate milk soufflé. The staff is young, and maybe a bit insecure, but this hardly harms the overall experience. At the end of the visit, coffee, digestives and petit fours are served in an upstairs room of the ancient chateau. As the sun sets behind the Grisons mountains, you have all the time in the world to become aware of the breathtaking excellence in cuisine and hospitality you have just enjoyed.

2020-01-09,Joe_Black72,"I know... I promised in my past reviews I wouldn't have visited any more 3 Michelin star restaurants... But I did it again.   And result was the same.  3 Michelin stars -and Michelin star rates restaurants in general- are the most impersonal restaurants I know. No character,  no passion,  it seems they cook to get 3 stars.  In the old days instead,  you got 3 stars because you cooked.  Anyway....   Amazing location in one of the best cantons of Switzerland. Very nice atmosphere and very private dining rooms.  Chef Caminada may be a great food engineer,  no doubt about that,  but what he is totally missing in my view is the connection to the territory.   We are in a Canton full of great mountains... So why the hell do I need to feel Asian influence in my plates?  I wanna fell the mountains and its smell.  If I want to feel Asian I would go to an Asian restaurant!   The endless pre entrees tastings were just too much.  And, again,  this is a new fashion -probably requested by Michelin so that you can get stars-,  which never existed in the older days where the heavyweight was food and not its design.   I can't tenner any main dish I would order again.  But for sure I thought twice I was somewhere between Vietnam and Cambodia,  and not in fantastic Graubuenden.   Sweets were not amazing at all,  although perfect from the outside.   Wine list honestly disappointing. Even more disappointing was that I asked something to the Sommelier and he couldn't answer -and me,  I'm not a professor at all...  I just know a few things about wines!.   Even more disappointing was the cheese dish.  I asked only one thing to the cheese dish waiter and,  again,  he couldn't answer.  And my question was SO basic!  I couldn't believe it.   These 2 people,  with all due respect,  shouldn't be working at a 3 stars restaurant!  This shows exactly today's attitude.  Great plates,  great designs,  amazing engineering in the food...  And no substance behind that. No passion.  No heart.    As much as I like you,  dear chef Caminada, you won't see me back unless you so profound changes to your kitchen...  You may loose some stars if you do that,  but you may make many more clients happy and become special also without stars.

2019-10-05,Yuan Y,"Schloss Schauenstein is an institution in Switzerland: most people have to book (and maybe even save) several months in advance, many come to celebrate a special occasion, and most people who dine here probably also regularly visit other fine dining establishments... so the expectations are very high.  We came for lunch - which is what we would recommend, as the entire meal lasted 5.5 hours, and we didn't eat for 16 hours afterwards. We've ordered the 6 courses meal, and my friend also ordered the wine pairing. As expected, the food was world class. Andrea Caminada, clearly, is a culinary artist. Excellent produce, stunning presentation, beautiful flavors. We especially loved the langoustine which was one of the best dishes I have eaten in my life. You get a huge selection of snacks and amuse-bouches before the starters, and I loved the small booklet to take home which included our menu as well as some seeds to plant at home.   When you dine in a restaurant like Schloss Schauenstein, the service needs to be on a par with the food as it shapes your entire experience... you might not remember most of the dishes that you ate, but you will always remember how you felt when you were at the restaurant. In this regard, unfortunately, our expectations were not met.   - The restaurant offers a free pick-up from Thusis which is very nice. We were warmly welcomed by a cheerful young lady who knew our names and immediately made us feel like we were old friends.   - Schloss Schauenstein is a beautiful little castle, and all the surroundings are also very charming. We took our apéro with the first snacks on the pretty terrace, this is where we met our main server who didn't seem to like us very much. One of the various small snacks was a ""foie gras bonbon"" but because I had mentioned in advance that I don't like foie gras, I got a little tartlet as an alternative. My friend whispered to me that she had forgotten to mention that she doesn't like liver, so I asked the server if he could bring another tartlet, and the response was: ""The tartlet is the alternative for the person who had mentioned in advance that she does not eat foie gras."" (???) We did not get another tartlet, so I told her to eat mine.   - We only had 3 tables in our room with 4 other people, and we counted 8 servers in total. Most of them were very friendly and nice, except the aforementioned gentleman who was professional but we could tell that he did not warm up to us. Unfortunately, I didn't ask for his name so let's just call him ""Mr. X"" for this review.   - My friend got her first glass of wine and immediately said ""I can mostly smell dishwashing detergent"". She didn't say anything but when it happed again with the third glass of wine, she mentioned it and immediately got a new glass, but the waiter said that they had had the problem before and had tried various solutions... to no avail. If you have had this problem before, I just wonder why servers don't ""check"" glasses before pouring guests wine? At a restaurant of this calibre, you simply can't have glasses smelling of dishwashing detergent!   - Mr. X didn't seem very well-informed with regards to the wines. He would e.g. confuse Spanish and Italian wines, even though he was looking at the bottles when he introduced them.   - We absolutely loved the cheese course which came with various delicious snacks (cured meats, Maluns, a gorgeous panforte, tiny potatoes etc.). A lovely lady explained the different cheeses and put together a little selection for each one of us. At the end, she said that she'd be happy to come back if we'd like another piece of one of the cheeses. Because we loved the cheeses, we did want a little more cheese after we had finished. When we asked Mr. X, he was clearly not amused and told us, that the cheese cart was already gone but if we told him EXACTLY which cheese we wanted, he could MAYBE get us another small piece. I didn't remember the names of the cheeses that I wanted and because he seemed irritated, we just asked for the only one where we could remember details. At this point, our happy mood had vanished, because we felt like a nuisance.    - Our neighbors couldn't finish their bread and asked to take it home with them. The waiters brought out a new bread in a nice box for them (very nice gesture), and when I saw that, I said (more as a joke) ""ohhh, I want one too!"". Mr. X then looked at me with indignation and said ""SERIOUSLY?"".   - At one point, Mr. Caminada himself came out to say ""hello"". He was very professional but also seemed very reserved, it didn't feel like he enjoyed the interaction with the guests, and it was more of an obligation. Our neighbors celebrated their 22nd anniversary and had eaten at Schloss Schauenstein several times in the past. I would expect a Michelin*** restaurant to do something special for such an occasion, and I would expect the chef to know... but he didn't. The couple had to mention to him that they were here for their anniversary, Mr. Caminada said ""oh, congratulations"" and directly moved on to the next table.    - We went back to the terrace for our coffee/tea and the petit fours (beautiful!). I wanted to order a jasmine tea (which is not a very unusual tea choice), and Mr. X told me that they didn't have it, because ""nobody else orders it"". Slightly disappointing as I'm a tea sommelier and would expect at least the most common tea choices in a restaurant like this. We chatted with the lovely couple next to us (who were celebrating their anniversary), and they told us that they had ordered 3 courses for CHF 216 + an extra foie gras starter. What they didn't know, and what nobody told them, was, that the foie gras starter was CHF 95.- extra = they ended up paying CHF 311 for 4 courses, when the 6 courses meal was only CHF 270.   All in all, our experience confirmed why Andreas Caminada is one of the best chefs in the country: All his accolades are well-deserved, and the food was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the service was not. When I pay this kind of price for a meal, I expect the staff to go the extra mile to ensure that I have a fabulous experience, and I want them to HAPPILY bring me whatever I want. I want the same attention to detail which has been poured into all of the dishes which we ate that day. It's just such a pity that so many people work hard to create an experience for the guests but at the end of the day, you will mostly remember the weakest link...   We went to IGNIV the next day and had a better time there: While the food was in our opinion on a similar level, the service was so much warmer, and we felt truly taken care of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r715578014-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,4,en
2019-09-22,travelin_tommy,"My wife and I had a wonderful, but costly, experience dining here. The service was impeccable. The ambience was terrific, sitting on the terrace for apperitivi and snacks and later for coffee and dessert, as well as inside for our lengthy meal (since we chose to have multiple dishes from the menu rather than choose a la carte). There were multiple samples of amuse bouche as well as desserts served with the coffee, not counting the multiple different dishes on the menu. Frankly, we did not have any that we thought were less than very good, many were excellent, and also many were surprising in taste combinations we had not previously had nor considered. We have eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants; sometimes we have questioned their stars, but not the three stars awarded here. My only quibble was with the drinks: everything was very expensive. Wine on their selected list to compliment the meal was good but not really exceptional. Furthermore, comparing the price of two wines with which I was familiar on the list of their wines showed a mark-up of >3 times the price easily available elsewhere. My guess is that they make their profit on the wines to pay for the excellent service and food preparation that we experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r711964898-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

2019-07-19,Kellytx78,"My husband and I knew we wanted to take a fabulous trip to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had no idea where we wanted to go though. We love tasting menus so he did some research (shocking!!) and he discovered this amazing hotel & restaurant. We booked our entire trip around this hotel and restaurant. It was definitely worth it. We booked a night at the hotel in the castle and had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived to the train station in Thusis, we had a really kind woman (I can't remember her name though..) pick us up in an Audi A8 which of course my husband loved. She drove us to the castle and the minute we pulled up, I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew from the pictures that it was going to be incredible, but pictures don't do it justice. It is GORGEOUS! The grounds, the flowers, the castle...everything is picture perfect. Check in was super easy and she gave us a tour of the property so we knew where everything was. There are so many adorable little nooks and places on the property for various activities. I won't like - there were so many that I forgot them all! We went to the pool area for awhile, went to the beautiful lawn across from the castle, went to the terrace, went to another outdoor terrace for a few drinks....it was all just perfect. It was so quaint and beautiful, yet really welcoming which was nice. When we got back to our room (we stayed in the Kastanie which has low ceilings, just FYI if you are traveling with anyone tall) and got settled in. The room is so charming. We loved it. Staying in the hotel was the perfect setting too. Anyway, we got a knock on our door while I was getting dressed in the bathroom, but it was the chef's wife! She explained there was a little issue with another hotel guest and the guest needed a special room to accommodate a health concern. My husband and I were happy to move rooms, so we packed our stuff and headed downstairs to the lobby. On our way down, we passed Marco (more about him later) and he was determined to carry our luggage for us, but my husband refused to let him. He was so kind and really wanted to carry it, but my husband is stubborn. Ha! Anyway, we ran into Sarah and Enna (I think that was how it's spelled) on the stairs. Enna oversees the dinner service I believe. They explained that the guest had solved their issue by switching with another couple they were with so we didn't have to change rooms after all. Sarah was soooo apologetic and kind, and we could tell she felt really bad about us packing our stuff. We really didn't mind though and we told her it was completely fine. I joked with her and told her I just wanted to meet her husband because I had researched the restaurant and the hotel and was seriously fascinated and inspired by him. She said she'd gladly tell him to come meet us during dinner. Needless to say, I was really excited. We got dressed, and headed to one of the loveliest rooms for the Apertif. Words can't explain the beauty of this room. The ceiling detail was stunning and so beautiful. The walls were painted with these gorgeous paintings. I can't even describe it because it's simply stunning, but in a very charming and welcoming way. My favorite colors are pink and green and there were accents of them in the room, which also was just so pretty! They seated us at a small table and greeted us with a glass of complimentary champagne from Sarah. It was really nice of them. They also took our picture for our anniversary which was a perfect momento from our evening. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I won't go into detail, but the dinner was AMAZING. It was absolutely the most exquisite dinner we've ever had. It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. Marco was one of our main servers and he was the best. He was funny, charming, so kind and really made our experience an even better one. All of the service team was very nice. He and Alexander were the ones who really made the best impression because they were so friendly. We are from Texas and like to talk so they were really nice to talk to us. I could tell they read their diners really well because a few other diners didn't seem as chatty as we were and they weren't as chatty with them. Anyway, they were great. Towards the end of our dinner, Chef Andreas came to our table and talked to us. He was so friendly and it was surreal. I'd read so much about him so the fact that he comes and introduces himself and thanked us was so impactful. He greeted all the tables, but I asked him if I could take a picture with him and he said he'd be happy to. We went to the lobby, snapped a pic and mentioned to him that it would be great if he was around the next day so we could get a picture of him with something we'd brought (something from my husband's job which wouldn't make sense unless you're from Texas). He said he'd be around in the morning and to let the front desk know when we were available. We said bye, got a cocktail to go and walked outside to the terrace to look at the beautiful grounds again. They're illuminated at night and it's like a fairy tale. The next day, we went to breakfast (which was soooo good. The croissants are the best I've ever had) and then we strolled around again and decided to stop at the Casa Caminada (his newest hotel property on the grounds which is a little more casual). It was really cool and obviously didn't have the history of the castle, but it was really beautiful, yet trendy, yet classic. Hard to explain. The floors are awesome though. Anyway, there is a bakery in there and a coffee area in the restaurant so we got a cup of coffee and went to sit outside. We had mentioned to the front desk that if Sarah or the Chef was around and available, that'd be great, but no worries if not. We didn't really think they'd come by, but about 5 minutes later, they did! We chatted for a bit, took another picture and Chef went to go about his day, but Sarah talked to us for a while. She is wonderful. If you get a chance to meet her, definitely do because she's one of the kindest women I've ever met. She and I had a lot in common because of kids, etc. so it was really nice talking to her and learning more about the hotels and IGNIV. If you don't know about it, look it up for sure.  After a lovely chat with her, it was time for us to go back to the train station. I was so so sad to leave because it was just incredible, but it was the PERFECT anniversary in the perfect location. It's breathtaking and the food can't even be put into words. Simply put - if you're planning a trip to Switzerland, you MUST stay at this castle and dine at the restaurant. If you aren't planning a trip, do it because you won't regret it and you'll make memories that will last a lifetime. They made such a great impression on us and we absolutely cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r690892599-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

Take the way through the garden, the view in the castle is breathtaking. The staff do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable, it’s a balance act between top class food and down to earth atmosphere in a castle that’s one of a kind. Hardly ever have I enjoyed a lunch lasting over 4:30hrs and wished for more.  Hint: if it’s warm/sunny, try having the aperitif on the terrace, even better on the tower.  The food, well it’s a piece of art and I won’t try comparing it to anything because I just do t have the words for it.

2019-02-13,MarinMarais,"I was really looking forward to dinner at Schloss Schauenstein and in the end, it was mostly what could be expected from an evening at a star restaurant. Attentive and knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, high level of complexity in courses and an interesting wine pairing. The most disappointing course was the cheese which I found unremarkable in taste and in which I believe made my stomach sour at the end of the evening. I could appreciate the time and care that goes into creating, preparing and serving a multitude of complexities on a dish, but in the end, it’s a long evening (from 19.00-almost 23.30 when we finally finished dessert in the main dining room) of hodgepodge different courses that don’t necessarily go together or complement each other. I was looking for more harmony in what was presented. I’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, this was the first 3* and I would hope that 3* and the prices that go with it would warrant something especially creative or special but it wasn’t my opinion of the evening at the Schloss. Everything was executed to an extremely high standard but it just failed the wow factor for me, it was just lacking soul. I left thinking that the price wasn’t worth the evening. It’s a pure question of taste, of course, as the quality is definitely there, but for me it was just a technically ambitious variety show of amouse bouche, tasting dishes and desserts. The expectations for a 3* restaurant are probably unreasonable, but I think the main reason people are drawn to these restaurants is to leave feeling inspired in one way or another by the chef’s creativity.  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I suspect that Caminada’s taste is perhaps just not my taste, and that’s ok, because it seems he impresses and inspires more than enough people!

So, yes, visiting Schloss Schauenstein is a MUST. The “but”, though is related to the staff.

2018-12-09,HansM,"Of course, it is an expensive place to go to - but still, it is great value for money - and the wines are have better prices than in many less exclusive restaurants! For me, a restaurant has to satisfy me in three dimensions: Food - Ambiance - Staff and Andreas Caminada and his team make sure that all these dimensions are taken care of. You really feel welcome and at home, there are no stiff upper lips or french-style waiter snobbishness, everything goes easy but, as you can expect, is highly professional. This time round, we were very happy with the food which had the seasonal touch of fall-winter, but was still colorful and presented a happy contrast to the weather outside. Leave room for the cheese board which is full of excellent specialties from the region and even comes with some small blue local potatoes. Ms Junge does an excellent job with the wines. And last but not least, this is the restaurant where the chef shows presence, bids farewell to the guests. Overall, again a great experience.

Most striking of the restaurant is the relaxed atmosphere. We took our time browsing through the menu an the extensive wine menu. We asked many questions, but never did we detect any impatience.  As can be expected, all amuses and courses are excellent. Tastes are superior and most dishes have a nice ‘bite’. This is something we sometimes miss in restaurants in this league.

2018-08-02,malli42,"As mentioned in my other tripadvisor comments, this year we chose Andreas Caminada and the restaurant Schauenstein as our yearly 3* experience.   And also in a nutshell, overwhelming. This comments reflects also the hotel experience... from the first contact up to the last view there is absolutely nothing to complain about.   Hotel: We stayed in the room ""Wasser"", which is a double room located at the top of the main building. As we arrived pretty early a very nice host showed us everything and explained all facilities and possibilities. You have to imagine, that this is a relatively small castle, but there are hints and secret corners to relax, to sunbath, to crab some food & wine - simply to enjoy. Many thanks to the complete staff. But if you are interested to stay here, please have a closer look before choosing a room. In our room the shower was a bathtub in the middle of the room, the toilet was separated with translucent glass. Actually we liked it.   Restaurant: As many others wrote, marvellous. The weather was great, so we started with the aperitif and small snacks on the beautiful terrace. Here we also enjoyed the last glass of wine and petit fours after the marvellous dinner. Between these two delicacies we were faced a incredible genius menu, based only on local food (and it is incredible what is possible with this local stuff). Ok, two courses were weak compared to the others. But this is highly depend on personal taste. Last but not least not to forget the highly professional - but always with a twinkle in their eyes - staff.

The food is fantastic, yes, but it's the whole package that elevates the experience, especially if you stay at the hotel.   Every guest at dinner is given the chance to tour the kitchen, and your table is yours for the night. We walked through the gardens earlier in the day and saw a chef coming out of a poly tunnel - that's how fresh some ingredients are. And although the classic salmon and sorrel dish is not part of the menu anymore, the kitchen will happily cook it for you ahead of time. The acidity and freshness of each dish comes through in every bite, and I didn't feel overly stuffed at the end.

The film delves into the Troisgros family's operation of their Michelin-starred restaurant in central France.  Their new restaurant and hotel were wonderful, offering a Michelin three-star experience (unlike some three-star restaurants that I believe deserve only one star or none). The food was delicious, from the simple asparagus to the Charolais steak. The selection of cheeses was impressive, with probably about 50 varieties available.

Cesar Troisgros is not afraid to offer some bold flavour combinations, such as in the (cold) starter of langoustines with vegetables (beetroot ravioli) and flowers. The aiguillette de saint pierre au shizo was superb, showing some of the Japanese inspirations of the chef (he had some training in Japan).

The dining room and the place is close to extraordinary.   All this said, at some point you get a bill. We had chosen local wines 125 & 250 EUR / bottle. Nothing fancy. 388 EUR / p at the end ! 28 EUR  (x 10) for the welcoming cocktail ... (which was very good)  My point is we all have a psychological price we ca accept. Clearly above my standard here. We have tasted last year 2* Michelin which was nearly as good at less than 1/2 the price !    Do not get me wrong ... This is a UNIQUE experience.

2018-10-02,R113,"remarkable location and dining room, you feel like sitting in a forest, window walls to the garden outside, very generous space to the next table.... We did choose the menu but did ask for a change in the main course, no problem at all and not surcharge. That is service ! Food was well chosen to provide different taste which compliment each other. Just as we expected it from previous experience. The walk into the kitchen shows how much work and effort is behind each dish.

2018-09-28,Pioneer64765,"I have waited several days to write this so as to be sure of my negative feelings that remain. This is the first critical  review I have given. I have read the reviews from others, many of which are excellent, but  importantly there are marked similarities with our experience and others critical comments, that for me indicates a worrying trend. Before I get into the detail it is important to remember that many guests are, like us, coming to celebrate life’s milestones and achievements. The questions for you are why do we and why is  a 3 star restaurant so often a choice.  I think it is because we expect you to create a sense of wonder, of excellence, of the weaving of beauty and surprise. We want to be charmed and amazed by your creativity and skill I didn’t experience this particularly through the food. The restaurant setting and architecture are stunning and as the outer layer they are marvelous. The next layer are the staff and their skills. There were inexperienced. One would talk to us in English and another in rapid French that we cannot follow. When we questioned a wine match we were just told why it was made and our left over wine was just removed. They leant over us to serve rather than walk around. When a fly landed in my wife’s glass and crawled out the waiter just shooed it away and left. Towards the end of the meal the staff  were saying goodbye to each other in the restaurant. This regular pattern of life is not what we come for. The food itself was simple. It could not create wonder because it was so obvious. I know what kidney and crayfish looks and tastes like with or without fruit flavors although they were so small I couldnt wonder about the flavor but about how little it must have cost. The panna cotta on the melon is still as others have said totally overpowered by the hastily cut melon slice under it. There were no wonderful dishes. The whole tasting menu came out quickly and coupled with the wine pairing per course we were drinking too fast and eating too little. We felt rushed and processed. This continued for the whole meal. I sat for a while and asked to speak to the most senior staff in charge. They asked if I wanted an autograph.... His reply was I didn’t understand what they were trying to achieve which was elegant simplicity and it wasn’t possible to please everyone. There is a fine line between elegant simplicity and plain simplicity and I think it has been crossed. I don’t need to pay these prices for simplicity. There was no beauty or wonder in the food experience for us. We felt like a profit centre. Today we went to Lameloise that restored our faith.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3845710-d12334831-r620300185-Troisgros-Ouches_Roanne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,2,en

Pictures speaks for themselves, very poor preparation, absolutely no taste for at least 3 dishes. Only one sort of bread, nothing worth more than 1 Michelin star. We have been visiting other 3 Michelin stars restaurant (Pic,Donkel,Marcon,Savoy,Blanc,Ducasse) and I would definitely not put Troisgros on the same level. Yes you do have a great background and atmosphere to eat, everything is clean, the chef actually comes and greet you but at the end of the day, SERVICE and obviously the FOOD are the main things you are expecting to be top notch , especially at 270 euros per head...

2018-04-20,hawaiidan,"It took me 40 years to get to dine at this temple of gastronomy and in their new location in Oches.   A bit hard to find but well worth it.  Cab fare from the train station is about 16 -17 E .      The new location in Oches is incredible as it the decor and visual stimulus on a spring day  is worthy of mention.   It doesn't get much better that this  This place is legendary and I went with the full tasting menu with pared wines about 450E, with service included which for a place of this caliber for a 3.5 hour meal is not unreasonable..      I noted  that they do have a mini menu for children.   However  I dont recommend this place for for children  who can not grasp the experience any more than they could at Burger King.   ( I did see an american couple who brought their 7 and 8 yearold girls to dine.  The girls wore head phones and played with their phones the whole time oblivious to everything...What a sad waste) I traveled here from LA...6000 miles just for the experience as a pilgrim to a shrine. Cuisine has always interested me to the extent I took professional training to better appreciate its nuances.The tasting menu is 7 courses  + 3 amuse and +3 deserts   It was a further treat to me to be invited into the kitchen to talk with the chefs, who were both as great at their meals. Chef.Ceasar Troisgros has studied  with Thomas Keller of the French Laundry, and several of his dishes reflected some of Kellers technique.. It was a pleasure to watch the brigade from Gard to Sous working with such focus and attention to detail.    I think I enjoyed that experience as much as I did the meal.   It was food for the soul.     The wait staff, too, was warm and outgoing, and eager and would carefully explain in detail each course answering detailed questions as to ingredients.   At Troisgros, turn your self over to their  skill and passion. you will not regret it. I have dined around the world seeking out the best of the best  Troisgros is one of the finest and has held 3*** with Michelin  for 50 years !!

While the service was friendly and professional, the dishes, though artfully presented, fell short in flavor and left me underwhelmed given the steep prices.

2023-09-30,GlobetrottingSwede,"We went for lunch and had the seafood tasting menu. We were lucky enough to sit at the counter facing the kitchen so we could see all the preparation‘s in real time and we could even be served directly by one of the cooks.  This restaurant is a gutsy move by someone who used to be a food critic, Bruno Verjus. It is Carraige us to open a haute cuisine place and subject yourself to other critics.  Generally, I would say that he has succeeded : the dishes are creative and well prepared, and the service is impeccable.  Bruno Bruno himself, greets guests upon arrival and loves to chat with everyone which gives it a nice atmosphere and friendly touch.  However, there are still a couple of areas for improvement. For example, his lentil risotto was slightly disappointing because you could not taste the essence of the lentils. Instead, it is compensated with other flavors and that’s a shame for anyone who wants to put the product first. Also, in our tasting menu, there was a tendency to undercook the food or even serve it raw and then compensate with some other flavoring, which is a shame because you don’t get the full essence of some of the fish or seafood.  Final comment is about the prices which are absurdly high. This means of course you can’t come here for tasting menu on a regular basis and you even have to think twice for any meal at Table.  Still an interesting culinary experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r919088689-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

2023-05-04,Mitchell K,"Bruno, in my opinion, is one of the most inspired chefs in the world - and his restaurant, despite having received two Michelin stars, is vastly under appreciated.  Table should be mentioned alongside the well-known great restaurants in France.   Table provides TRULY CREATIVE food that also manages to be delicious. Chef Bruno plays with flavors and concepts in a way that brings the patron to the origin of each ingredient.  Words do not do this place, or this man, justice.  The food needs to be experienced.    The setting is a small bar-like environment, which still provides privacy between dining groups, due to clever architectural design.  An open kitchen is where the feast occurs for the eyes: a laboratory, an operating room, an orchestra.    The knowledgeable and engaging staff round out the experience, each with a distinct and welcome persona.  Poetic descriptions of each dish, and thoughtful wine pairings throughout.   And, all along, Chef is omnipresent. Overseeing his exemplary team, while he mingles with diners, popping back behind the bar occasionally to participate in the action. His bigger than life personality is felt in every moment of this epic experience.   There may be some reviewers who have been less generous in their praise than this one.  Maybe the price, or fish-heavy menu, or tasting menu is unappealing for some.  To me, however, Table is the perfect meal.

2023-01-23,LJL4090,"How to properly describe Table, an over-the-top experience with an over-the-top check (without wine, 400€/person)?   It is small (fewer than 40 seats), casual (ties, even jackets, would be out of place), out of the way in the 12th, even informal in the sense the lucky half or so guests sit on a serpentine bar surrounding a completely open kitchen manned by four very busy cooks and overseen by the voluble, extroverted, supposedly self-taught grey haired chef, Bruno Verjus.  Sometimes cooking, sometimes sitting with or mingling with guests, sometimes cooking over the shoulders of his young chefs.  From the clients’ view, all is integrated through the most caring, intelligent, articulate service staff I have ever encountered in a Paris restaurant.  They explain and interpret in the most effective and collegial way.  It is truly a smooth functioning luxury machine, with none of the bowing and scraping ballet of a more conventional two- or three-star restaurant.    The menu was almost entirely seafood, a subtle, maybe only seasonal, change from previous visits, more use of luxury ingredients; giant scallops, crab wrapped in chard, caviar (served with chocolate tarte and with thin sliced bass).    The taster and preparations, especially the extensive use of fresh herbs and the sourcing of every dish shows careful thinking and immense preparation.  The cooks are busy and focused, but most of the work has taken place prior to service.    Too many dishes to recall; salad, raw shrimp, urchin, crab, lobster, sweetbreads, sea bass, beet soup, roasted onion, etc., each served elegantly, but without pretense.  Leave wine choices to the young sommelier - she will bring glass after glass of unusual choices.   Not for everyone, but a noticeable step up thanks to Table receiving a second Michelin Star last year.

2022-01-07,LJL4090,"This was our fourth dinner at La Table.  It prompts a revision – upward.

They urge you to order the tasting menu.  Wildly expensive (300€) (as are the a la carte options).  It is fabulous.  Seemingly, it will continue until you ask them to stop.  Wine pairings offered (and changed) by the glass.  Heavy use of luxury ingredients:  langoustines, prawns, caviar.  Small portions, but many of them.  Delicately sliced raw squid with caviar, vegetables, sweetbreads, raw sardines, steamed langoustine.    The food was inventive, uncomplicated, prepared in front of you and served by cooks and waiters all of whom seemed to be having great fun.     And, every one of the 30 or so seats taken.

Each dish was unusual; small portions, attractive, unusually flavored. This was a tasting menu, of course, but put together in front of us, served and explained by the lovely, hardworking people who cooked it, overseen by a somewhat eccentric older chef who created it.

The server recommended the plat du jour : tuna ventresca with a couple vegetables, very light and delicate... without mentioning the price (other equivalent items on the menu were anywere from 30 to 50€... I just assumed the plat du jour was in the same range). No entrée, no desert, we just had one small cheese plate to share ... and two expressos. We also asked for two glasses of dry chenin blanc.  Bottom line: the food was excellent,as usual, but the bill came up to 245€!!!!!..... for a 1 course meal on a tuesday lunch... with tuna as « delicacy ».... this is totally absurd. Evenmore so that the chef actually did recognize me as a regular client....  I made a mistake in not asking the price of the tuna (70€ each... more expensive than lobster).... but another 100€ for one cheese plate, 2 glasses of wine and coffee! No way.

For main courses, my companion ordered the pintade and received the thighs, legs, and wings. Another diner across from him received the supreme. At €49, my companion was a bit disappointed. I had the bar sauvage, also excellent with a perfect sauce made from oxalis(?). A bit more sauce would have been appreciated. The bottle wine list was daunting: unfamiliar varieties and labels, all at very high prices. I think it would have been better to order individual glasses based on what we ordered, as advised by the staff. We didn't know this option was available until after we had ordered a bottle.

2018-11-05,LJL4090,"As the substance of this Diary should confirm, it is likely I am more familiar with Paris restaurants than many American visitors and probably many French.  So when a recommendation like Table comes along, a five year old Michelin one-star, that I have never even heard the name of, it surprises me.  It shouldn’t, there could be tens, maybe hundreds like it, although not likely as good.  More work to do!  Table is small, contemporary in feel in an unusual physical space.  A long, undulating counter running the full length of the space, with high top tables and a handful of conventional chairs and tables on the floor.  Everything is focused on the kitchen and chef and his three younger assistants who prepare and assemble all of the dishes from the short, but changing a la carte menu behind the counter (see L’Agrume, 5th).  Basically, sitting at the counter where most parties of two are seated, is eating in the kitchen.  The menu details the obsessive focus on artisanal sourcing.  We can attest to the bread; beautiful and delicious in a city replete with noteworthy bread.  All of this takes place in a perfectly safe-appearing, non-descript street in the slightly scruffy 12th, one block from the very busy (daytime only) Rue d’Aligre Market, the only open and covered market in Paris which on a daily basis combines food and flea market stalls.  FOOD The concise a la carte menu is expensive.  A 39€ 3 course formula this is not.  Entrees of raw fish, girolles lightly cooked and served with an egg yolk to break into the sauce, raw sardines and tomatoes with burrata were each in the range of 25€.  We had the girolles, generous and delicious.   The plats included sautéed monkfish or tuna, each carefully cut to order, pintade portioned from a very large semi-cooked bird and finished on the plancha, then sauced and plated with a boiled crayfish and served with a root vegetable “salad”, a small version of the vegetarian offering.  Also available was ¼ of a 3 pound Mediterranean lobster, split and grilled on the plancha (actually offered as an entrée) or sweetbreads sautéed in a half pound or so of butter.  (At 69€, they were going fast!)  Also on the entrée menu was sautéed frogs legs.  Being in the kitchen was an essential part of the experience, and an enjoyable one.  Desserts matched the food.  A version of ethereal chocolate mousse with ice cream, praline tart with sorrel ice cream, fresh strawberries with nuts, hot fresh cherries.  We never saw a wine list.  The glasses offered (16€) were varied and delicious, but judging from the wine on display, there is plenty to choose from.  SERVICE  A patient maître d’ explained each dish.  Kind servers delivered the food and wine.  Both exemplary, but the prime interaction was with the chefs, mostly watching.  PRICE  High, but worth the splurge.  All in with a total of 5 glasses of wine, 260€.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r631074407-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2018-10-30,Vatsala s,"Dear foodies, if you want to try something truly unique in Paris, this place is a must. The chef (Bruno) is an Einstein of food. It’s hard to express in words about his food, it’s just like art, you have to try it yourself and interpret it yourself. He is not your typical Michelin Star chef that went to culinary school and got trained. He was a doctor, a business dealer, a journalist, a food blogger, an activist for fresh produce......who translated his passion and experiences into the food at Table. Even though being a Michelin Star chef, he is so humble, kind and funny.  The staff is also very unique - they are young, talented, dynamic and take their jobs seriously with a smile on their face. I have never met any other restaurant staff elsewhere in Paris nor in other parts of the world, even with other Michelin Star places that have been so humble and inspiring as at the Table. They make you feel so at home. Last but not least, they also carry some of the most unique drinks from different parts of the world. Their wines are all natural (bio) and the sommelier (Pierre), who specializes in bio wines would treat you to the finest selections. You cannot go wrong with anything he recommends.  Best regards; Vatsala   ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d5594192-r629697687-Restaurant_Table-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

2021-01-01,Tashy007,"We were lucky to dine at ‘Memories’ restaurant. At the moment only hotel guests can book with the restaurant and the public outside cannot due to COVID. So it was easier to book but still we had to wait for a few days.  We didn’t know what to expect but had heard so many positive reviews.  We were not disappointed. It was amazing. The food was so flavourful and Chef Sven Wassmer allows the ingredients to shine. Who knew the plain potato could taste so good. We also chose to do the wine pairings and the wine chosen complimented each dish and added an extra complexity to the dishes. The sauces which included ingredients like pine oil tasted and smelt amazing and I made sure I scraped the dishes clean, not to leave any sauce behind.  The staff are so knowledgeable and friendly and surprised us with a little cake as we were celebrating my husband’s birthday.  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant and would suggest that you allow yourself to be open to go on this food/wine journey. The menu journey through ‘winter in the alps’ was brilliant. I look forward to sampling the other seasonal menu journeys in the future.

2020-02-17,Shelby L,"The best meal of my life. I went for the 12 course meal with wine pairing and didn't regret it. The staff were all so passionate about their jobs and had a story for each course. Every bite was well thought out and lovingly made. From clover, to fir, cheese water (cheese with no protein but all of the taste), char, venison, pulled pork and so much more. Sourced from almost exclusively local producers, this meal satisfied and surprised me. The bread was so lovely, with a crunchy exterior and perfectly soft inside. I could see the baker had carefully prepared his starter and experimented with various flours until he found the perfectly milled version. I had to hold myself back from eating it all for fear of filling myself too much to be able to finish the meal. Taking my tastebuds on a tour of the local farms with all of their innovative ideas and respect for traditional methods, I made my way through dish after dish. Each as spectacular as the last. In between dishes I could smell the smells of various things being prepared and it got me excited for what was coming next. The wine pairings complemented the food so well and were a show of their own. Finally the decor was lovely, providing warmth, class and privacy as I enjoyed my meal. Even the logo with its Swiss mountain M and moon O were cleverly incorporated. I will definitely be back!! Thank you to everyone on the team for sharing their amazing talents!

A lot has been written about the restaurant by many people. Some people talk about ""food from the gods"", others about ""out of this world"". Some agree that this is a real treat and will be etched in one's memory. And so do we.  It is always a real pleasure to be here. The snacks get you in the mood for the evening. The menu varies depending on the season, but certain ""classics"" are always on it. This was also the case with our visit with the char and the ""Knöpfli"".

2024-07-09,Kristin R,"The best thing about this restaurant was the bread. The other (extremely meager) courses had poorly matched flavor and texture, heavily focused on grassiness. We left hungry and hassled because the service was prolonged as well. Despite our clear requests upon booking and arrival at the restaurant that we finish in 2.5 hours, they failed to complete service in under 3 hours, and we raced to the airport to catch our flight. To provide context, we have eaten in Michelin restaurants for over 30 years throughout Europe and the US, and this was the most disappointing meal to date. We have allergies and dietary requirements, which were fully communicated to the restaurant in advance, but they still struggled to serve a first amuse-bouche after 45 minutes of waiting. The staff became defensive, saying they had to adapt to the diets causing the delay, but this information had been provided long in advance. They simply were not prepared. One amuse-bouche of kohlrabi with sour broth and gummy mini dumplings lacked seasoning and enjoyable texture. It was served in a partially- hollowed kohlrabi on a bed of leaves, but 95% of what was plated was inedible. We regretted not having a goat with us to enjoy most of what was served. This dish also resulted in a stomach ache for my son, leaving him in the bathroom for much of the meal and unable to eat any further courses. (More on that later!)  The other amuse-bouche of a cucumber and leaf with green oily pesto was incredibly messy to eat. In general, it seemed like the chef had never tried to eat what he served because it was clumsy to eat the courses as presented with crockery and cutlery. A potato spaghetti dish was impossible to twirl on a fork and too big for the round, awkward spoon. I could go on and on about how they missed the mark on making food that was both delicious and elegant to eat. The dessert was a green, grassy dish that did nothing to finish the meal with any sweet satisfaction. The texture of swallowing leaf after leaf was wholly unenjoyable. One of the most glaring errors of the lunch was the plating of the post-dessert bite... a rhubarb custard was served in a clamshell on a bed of real snail shells. How inappropriate in general, but especially for the vegetarians in our group! As stated earlier, the only item anyone in our party would want to eat again was the bread, BUT when we asked for more, we were told that they only make enough rolls for the number of people booked each day. They managed to find one squashed piece for my son, but that was the only one left. Back to service and my son... as I mentioned, the strange vegetable combinations in the amuse-bouche gave him a terrible stomach ache, and he was unable to eat any of the further five courses in the meal. The staff NEVER asked if he was okay, despite my hinting that the food triggered his illness. They were more focused on fussing about, folding his napkin in a perfect triangle as he came and left from the bathroom. At the end, they tried to seem accommodating by offering to ""make an exception for him"" and serve him French fries not on the menu, but greasy food was not what a sick teenager needed. Their insensitivity is inexcusable. They charged him the full 150 euro, despite having eaten nothing because of his pain. As a point of comparison, we were at Taillevent 20 years ago, and one person in our group was ill and only eating small bites of every course. When the bill arrived, there was no charge for the ill gentleman's meal. We even enquired if there was a mistake, but the maître d'hôtel insisted that the restaurant only charged those who could enjoy a full Michelin gastronomic experience. Flore could learn something from the French. The arrogance and incompetence that we felt throughout the meal at Flore left us wondering how they maintain a 2* Michelin rating. The restaurant is oblivious to true client needs and incapable of making an exceptional dining experience. They operate in a little bubble within a luxury hotel, catering to tourists looking to be impressed by strange flavors and textures, rather than truly delicious ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r958689690-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,2,en

The atmosphere alone is a good support to the beautiful cuisine served there. The menu is set with a series of sometimes seemingly unremarkable dishes that are invariably delicately twisted in an innovative and fascinating new take on what came disguised as unremarkable. Some of the combinations, ingredients, and preparations are mind-boggling, bordering on genius. The room is small enough that diners can be eat one of the dishes in the menu at the chef’s table in front of the kitchen, and enjoy a front row to the precise work of this well-organized kitchen. The wine list has a few gems, as you would expect in a 2-Michelin-star restaurant, but also an extensive array of up-and-coming winemakers with a distinct emphasis on organic and bio-dynamic productions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2315768-r944257405-Restaurant_Flore-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,5,en

We visited during the time period they were serving their Spring Season, 7-course, Botanic menu.  The dishes involved no animal or seafood meats, just 65 or so different plants.  Wow, the richness and flavor intensity could have fooled me into believing more than plants were involved.  The chef produced a cornucopia of wonders with this fruit-vegetable-herb menu.  I can’t even begin to recall what ingredients were in each dish but my wife and I enjoyed every single course.  I must admit the roughage caused me a little GI issue later on, but overall, this was quite the dining experience.

2023-05-18,amandajsayers,"We were blown away by the sheer genius of invention and the intricacy of each little morsel. I have to admit to not having realised this was a vegetarian restaurant but the lack of fish or meat made no difference. This team specialises in achieving some of the same textures and mouth experiences as you might expect from a regular meal eg the richness of a “meat” reduction to pair with a “steak” made of aubergine stuffed with vegetables and glazed to perfection. The vibrancy and colours made each dish a delight. An added bonus was being invited to sit at the kitchen table for one of the courses. The wine pairing was inventive, organic and good value. Set meal was EU 185 and wine pairing EU 105, which we felt was extremely fair.

2023-05-09,Heiwa-san,"We were surprised upon arrival when the waiter told us that tonight’s menu was completely vegetarian to celebrate Spring.  The restaurant mentions that it's menu is comprised of sustainable seafood and local vegetables.  That was a disappointment.  We also heard those same sentiments by other diners that evening.  However, the experience was wonderful, and the vegetarian dishes were visually appealing and tasted fresh, but the appearance of Kohlrabi multiple times lended to a bit of monotony in taste, as did the use of fermented yeast foam.  We did thoroughly enjoy our first course of 25 different vegetables at the Chef's table in the kitchen - that was fun and informative. The highlight was the Japanese-inspired chawan-mushi with tempura marigold flowers - that was the only non-vegetarian dish.  My wife had a glass of wine and I opted for the fruit and vegetable nonalcoholic drink pairing, which was interesting, and seemed to match well with each course.  Service was excellent, and the ambiance very serene and calm.  We had a window seat looking onto the canals which was very nice, especially at sunset.  Overall, the food was very attractive and expertly prepared offering many different textures and tastes, and we experienced something new - a vegetarian Michelin star experience.   However, we both left hungry and would have appreciated some seafood or bread - or at least some advance notice that the menu would be vegetarian.   Would  we return?  Probably not for another vegetarian experience but if you are a vegetarian, you might enjoy it immensely.

2023-05-08,Priscilla T,"Flore is a restaurant where we felt warm and welcomed as soon as we stepped inside. The decor is no frill, Nordic mordern with botanical charms.  Staff are beyond courteous and very knowledgeable about their dishes.  We were lucky to visit the kitchen and enjoyed one of our courses there, and chatted with the chef. You can sense his passion towards vegetables,  both via chatting and via tasting his cuisines.  This is a meal that does not make you miss animal proteins at all. You feel refreshingly recharged with every course, with no over-bloated stomach like you would after a multi-course menu at other Michelin Star restaurants.  My most memorable dish of the night was the chawanmushi with the marigold tempura combo. Simple ingredients, well prepared. The chef really knows how to let the freshness of the produce sing.

2024-09-27,Fab',"Very unique approach where all tables are served at the same time, where all comes from the local area, where the entrées is an abundance of dishes all executed to the millimeter and where the guests are invited to be active and find out what are they tasting.  The view to the kitchen shows that everything is being tested before is is sent out; this is a very impressive machinery and the amount of work produced in the kitchen is herculean.  Note on the bread, it is home-made too and in such a nice way that it has been years since eating such bread, and it will be years till the next one.  This is a moment suspended away from time in a very intimate room. The dinner takes easily 4 hours: we come here for taking time and taking things slow. Due to the nature of the fact that all is prepared on the spot and the room is served entirely at the same time, there can be some moments that are a bit long.  It is worth noting that none of the tables ordered any alcohol; the cuisine is self sufficient and no pairing is required. Also, there are so many dishes that if you had to take a glass even on every other dish only, one wouldn’t be able to get full tasting capabilities by the end of it.  It is also a very unique approach that there is no vertical management, and it shows on how peaceful the team is. Each team member is handpicked to be sure they fit in this unique management style, and talking with them is already a travel by itself.  It is a success all throughout and it deserves more than 1 star; maybe 1.5 star. The washroom is maybe the only thing that is not fully on par with the rest of the establishment.  Booking in advance recommended, table near the windows and the cliff will mainly make sense for lunch.

2024-08-15,Urszula S,"The views are beautiful and the food is nice and innovative, but I expect more from a Michelin star restaurant. Food - interesting and unusual taste combinations, some very tasty, but no “wow-moments “. Instead there were a few dishes I definitely disliked. The chef should perhaps focus on balancing/perfecting selected dishes, rather than producing a multitude of tastes. Far too much sour (and I mean REALLY sour) flavours for my taste. Also, two chicken main dishes in a set menu is not really ok. In general, except for the multitude of colourful starters, it felt quite cheap, especially for the prices they are charging. The strongest point for me was the extensive use of fresh herbs/flowers from their own garden in every dish. It did elevate the taste and overall experience. Drinks - generally very good wines, well matched with the dishes. A very tasty and original aperitif of the house. Nice selection of digestives. For environmental reasons they use their own filtered tap water, which is ok (although the taste was not great). What is not ok is to charge for it as if it was an exclusive bottled water. Service - very friendly and attentive, but lacking the smooth excellence you expect in a star restaurant. Three waitresses for the whole dining room (including the sommelier) is not really enough and the service was sometimes delayed, or not synchronised. Their English was also not really fluent. The explanation/presentation of dishes was much more limited than in other star restaurants. Setting - except for the nice view, the place really lacks some style and refinement. The decor gives a cosy, but cheap impression. The napkins looked and felt like they were my grandma’s age and they were not even nicely ironed. You are expected to use the same cutlery for multiple dishes. The tables outside would fit better in a roadside cafe and the walk to the entrance makes you wonder if you’re entering someone’s (not very tidy) backyard. It is not even lit in the evening - don’t forget your flashlight! To sum up - Aponem is a nice restaurant and definitely worth a visit if you are a foodie and don’t care much about prices. It is definitely overpriced for what is delivered and it definitely doesn’t live up to a Michelin star experience. If you want a real star experience, drive around 15-20 minutes towards the coast and restaurant De Lauzun - that is a star restaurant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r965037627-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html,3,en

This time we started with a cocktail that Gaby created based on a few ideas of things we like, and it was a sign of the many more good things to come from the Aponem team.

The wine list is extensive and slightly confusing as we had no idea what we were going to eat, so unsure what the best wine to go with it was, we just went with the sommeliers recommendation, which proved to be excellent. Sadly I had to come back to England, but I know my family plans to revisit the Aponem  in December, I am jealous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6919454-d15027610-r635610383-Aponem_Auberge_du_Presbytere-Vailhan_Herault_Occitanie.html,5,en
2018-09-20,RonaysRevenge,"Well it looks like I have the distinction, nay honour, of being the 1st Brit to review this magnificently located jewel. Fortune had smiled upon us this Monday for having discovered all other restaurants were shut we were blessed to be offered the last two remaining covers at this recently under-a-new-team opened gem of a place. From the go this tiny shrine to the gods of gourmand presented impeccable service and charm, the front of house welcoming and attentive - as well as fluent in spoken English which we found essential when the various plates were explained, my grasp of French sadly rusty. From the menu of two choices (the accompanying wine suggestions sadly not taken due to chauffeuring duties) we sensibly opted for the full Aponem. What followed was a succession of impeccable plates of creativity, beautifully executed and cooked with great passion and love. Organic ingredients sourced from either the region or their own garden had been prepared to maximise flavour and the presentational skills displayed showed the young team have all learnt their craft from the best and will no doubt make this a rising star to be watched very carefully.  We will be revisiting Aponem again very soon - next time I'll make sure I'm not driving so as to include the accompanying wine reccomendations.  Merci a tous au restaurant et Bonne Chance!

2024-07-20,Smudger,"On arrival  they told us not to look at the menu they gave us which was waxed closed as it is a surprise experience. Sadly, it wasn’t the experience we were expecting as 13 of the 15 courses were vegetarian which we did not expect. Don’t mind some vegetarian courses but not 90 %. The paired wines included 8 wines of which 6 were unfiltered which again one or two unfiltered would be fine hence not what we were expecting. Portion sizes were off the scale poor and even the flavour and quality of produce was way below expectation mostly bland. Having eaten in many Michelins  based restaurants .. 360 and Proto in Dubrovnik, Sukaldean and Bernard Extea in San Sebastien to name a few where quality of food and overall experience was truly Michelin. This experience was sadly our worst experience of a Michelin based restaurant hence fell way below expectation as food is a key element of any dining experience which was unbelievably poor in this case. Given we were in Hungary we expected some form of Goulash would have been on the menu given claims of local produce!! The only plus was the service. Finally, the price was staggeringly  out of sync with the food quality and wines hence as much as I hate to say it, it was a complete ripoff as one of the courses was bread n butter to fill us up as the previous and future courses would have left us still hungry.

2024-03-31,Koltrip,"Not sure what to rate this fine dining restaurant. From you enter you are taking very good care of. Everything works very good. During the 15 courses which I think is a bit exaggerated because some of the ""dishes"" are so small that you almost can't taste them, we had 2-3 highlights. The bread for 1 of the dishes was maybe the best bread ever eaten. The mushroom dish was also very good. Rest of the dishes was average and a couple was not tasty. When it comes to the wine paring, we had local wines, there were many highlights. We had one small dish we couldn't eat and to be honest at this level of dining we expected that they would come up with some extra for us but they didnt. Overall a good experience but many of the dishes are too small. Myself I just get irritated to get dishes that are at this size. So maybe based on the price and expectations of this kind of restaurant it should get a 3/5 but the wine paring gives it a 4/5. 210.000 forint are expensive for a couple.

2023-11-12,Zesty1,"Exquisite and indulgent - but the multiple courses were all very clean, with a focus on local ingredients, and they had a vegetarian option for my wife which made this place stand out.   First off we did find it slightly uncomfortable (it's not a discreet dining experience, but rather interactive, with tables near each other and facing to the open room, and other couples within earshot). The  requisite presentation was a little florid, and they make a lot of spectacle about the chef's personal stories etc - but they did a good job with it overall. Waiters didn't always look comfortable standing around either but they were speedy and the service was good.  Eventually we did get into the swing of things and relaxed a bit during the meal (helped by excellent local natural wines and lemonades).  Not cheap but also not on the crazy side of the price spectrum of Michelin restaurants. It appeared that this was the most sustainable of them all in Budapest, which I also appreciated. Recommended.

2023-06-22,Michael U,"Opened in 2019 SALT is considered by many to be Budapest's best Restaurant, its location in a boutique hotel called RUM featuring warm wood tones surrounding an open kitchen with most plates finished at a pass in front.  Led by Chef Szilárd Tóth and Manager Máté Boldizsár with service comparable to the world’s best, many dishes telling a tale of Hungarian heritage, SALT relies on ideas akin to “new Nordic” fare with foraging and fermentation at the forefront while Beverages look to local or natural Wines plus Juices made to pair.  A “story-teller’s” tasting, fifteen courses plus additions on both ends delivered at an appropriate pace, it is with Kombucha that guests are invited to taste a bundle of Herbs dragged through Carp Milt plus Celeriac and Fish in a Tuile before moving on to blanched White Asparagus lent acidity by a Dip of Nettles and Ants.  Plated Scandinavian but distinctly Hungarian in terms of terroir, one-bite “Greasy bread” hearty but balanced with Eel instead of Jowl Bacon, Cauliflower comes charred next to Walnut Cream that leads well into Cheese topped with micro-planed Pork Heart.  Contemporary with roots in local ingredients and rural dishes, the casual environment adding to the sense of dining at a friend’s house, Tóth’s “Chicken of the Woods Mushroom” comes in aromatic Corn Miso prior to a refreshing “Gin & Tonic” Bite composed in the kitchen.  Choosing another Juice going forward, Lime and Strawberry accented by Bay Leaf holding up to Soup and Bread made for dipping, a second plate in the same vein references a peasant dish from Pécs rethought with Foie Gras and Duck Heart in hearty Broth.  Pumping the breaks with raw local Trout in an ice bowl, acidic like Aguachiles but lacking Chiles, Potatoes in Duck Fat proves to be an elegant setup for sticky Pork Ribs intended to be eaten as a Lettuce Wrap topped in fermented foraged Greens.   Outpacing the single Michelin Star received in 2021, a Cheese course adjacent Chestnut Honey and Pine transitioning to sweet, SALT’s Rice Pudding with Chamomile is an exercise in restraint that fully engages the palate before finishing with floral Matcha and a quartet of Petit Four.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r896865619-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en

2023-05-07,geterd0ne,"Deserving of all the attention and praise from it's star. All the courses were beautifully presented with attention to detail and the service was perfectly choreographed. With prior warning during our reservation, they delivered a extravagant vegetarian course for one person in our party.   The menu changes seasonally and has a lot of fermented flavors, and less obsessive about heavy fats as compared to other fine dining. It's a long tasting menu and paced to fill you up. We opted away from the wine pairing and they offered a delightful pairing of homemade juices. Some of the juices were highly unorthodox, but each was immaculately paired to the uniqueness of the course in front of you.   My only negative opinions would be the chef is leaning-in on the sustainability angle a little too hard in the protein department. Also for a 3.5-4 hour seating, the chairs they are using for their 2-person tables is woefully inadequate in the comfort department. The service, glassware, and presentation were all multi-star experience, but the soft touches seemed to be lacking.   All considered they delivered exactly on what they promised and we'll be back.

2023-04-21,Zesty1,"I came to Salt with my girlfriend just to try it out, and we were blown away. We don't always enjoy stuffy, regimented fine dining experiences, but our initial apprehension (we had just seen the movie the Menu, and were reminded of this) was immediately suppressed by the quiet courtesy and professionalism of the staff, and a stunning sequence of dishes that catered to both of us (my girlfriend is a vegetarian, and the vegetarian versions of the menu delivered completely too).  For this, I specifically wanted something that focused on sustainable food, farm to table, or a cuisine that didn't make me feel like I was eating somewhere that was importing lobster from Maine into a landlocked country over thousands of miles. This reminds more of the style of modern Scandinavian cuisine, with very pure and earthy flavors, local produce and meat, and the chefs and various servers presented a story with each course that reflected the desire for homegrown fare, and also completely delivered.   I can't really describe a standout dish - I can only say that dish after dish was completely delicious, and oftentimes hitting the peak of flavor combinations that made our brains go mushy with euphoria.   It's the best restaurant I have tried in Budapest. It is certainly an expense (roughly 400-500 euro for 2 people), but if you are into a full, hours-long food experience it, it is worth the money and the time.   My one criticism was the layout of the place - as I diner II felt somewhat exposed and at first uncomfortable, rather than tucked into a romantic or private space with a partner, even with the view of the kitchen, which was very nice.

2022-09-20,#rooftopfoodie,"Salt is a fairly new Budapest establishment and a worthy Michelin-star holder. It is small with only ten tables so booking well in advance is the only chance to enjoy a meal here. The fixed menu relies on Hungarian traditions and many special local ingredients, many coming from the village where the chef grew up. It also includes many unusual ingredients for Hungarian kitchen such as snails once favored by wealthy noble families and now extinct from tables. For foreigners probably best to visit with a Hungarian who undoubtedly will relate many childhood stories to some of the food served. The wines in the wine pairing are mostly biodynamic and natural so unless favoring such flavours, probably better to choose from the wine menu.

2024-09-26,mokstarr7,"I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.  First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.  Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.  Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.  I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses.

2023-11-08,Amalia M,"Disappointed with our entire dinner experience. We did the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing. The dinner portions were very small. The wine served was small enough for a tasting. It was all extremely over priced. Altho the explanation of each dish was done in English it was difficult to understand the server. I would have liked a menu to take home with us so we could have discussed the meal. Some restaurants do that & it a wonderful keepsake. The food overall was fine but not memorable. This restaurant is pretentious & overrated, extremely expensive & not worth the experience.

2023-08-17,AnGr2013,"We had dinner here. My wife and I eat at Michelin restaurants occasionally and were really looking forward to this. Our table was at the ground level of the hotel, felt like a dark hotel lobby with simple furniture. We were placed at a table for four which made me feel the whole evening as if two guests were missing at our table. If I book for two, I want to sit at a table for two.  For the entire dinner experience the dull elevator music was in an endless loop and the presentation of the food was the same. Every dish in a large plate with a tiny, tiny dish in the middle, all dishes accompanied by some extra sauce poured or crunch that was served with a lot of tamtam.   All dishes came with unbelievably elaborate explanations, at some point I felt tempted to tell the waiters that I just want to eat my food and not listen to them. The portions were miniscule even for three star Michelin standards.  The more explanations a dish needs, the less I trust it. Good food needs to speak for itself.      The desserts should be the grand finale, when the kitchen pulls out all the stops to bring the meal to a grandiose  ending. Far away from that in our experience.   Last but not least the wine menu: I find my way around any wine menu and dont need the help of the sommelier. But the Rutz wine menu doesnt even tell me if the wine is white or red (for appellations that produce both) I felt almost embarrassed to ask the sommelier.  And when the bill came and I saw I was charged EUR 32 for a 0.1l glass of champagne, I left the place angry and will not return.

2023-06-16,Xierwan,"We were eager to try the restaurant, as we had many good surprises with German chefs who had emigrated to countries other than Germany. Indeed, the country seems to have taken the same direction as its northern European neighbours for several years, with on the one hand a modern and inventive cuisine and on the other a completely revisited traditional cuisine.  The restaurant itself is superb, as well as the terrace, on which we were seated. The wines and food were all extraordinary without exception, as they should be in any establishment of this range (and with these high prices, it must be said).  The service is smooth, professional but also very relaxed, just like in any Scandinavian restaurant and also as nice and friendly as are the inhabitants of Berlin. Special thanks to the sommelier for his excellent advices and to the waiter who gives a casual thumbs up to signify that he is happy with our praise of the food.  This was a great experience for us, but I would perhaps not recommend it to people who think high gastronomy should always be buttoned up to the neck with old fashioned and stiff waiters in suit.

2023-06-07,MartinTafft,"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  We had high hopes and expectations from the reputation and the three Michelin star badge.  We regularly visit good restaurants when we are on our travels at home and in Europe.    We chose to have the eight course menu with the accompanying wine flight.  Things started pretty well with two or three really tasty and enjoyable amuse-bouche dishes.  Unfortunately, as the meal progressed we found ourselves increasingly disappointed by the standard of some of the dishes.  We also had a very distinct feeling that a number of the dishes were just far too oily.   Normally, the selected wines that accompany each course have the function of enhancing and complementing the flavours of the dishes, however, it felt as though they had been selected to try to combat the oiliness of the dishes.  Before we came to the end of the meal, we both were beginning to feel the slightly ill effects of the greasy nature of the meal.  When I compare this experience with many other recent experiences of less well acclaimed restaurants, and some other one and two star restaurants, I found it both disappointing from a culinary and flavour experience and also poor value for money.  It was, to my mind, extremely expensive for what it was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r893924466-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,3,en

We dined as a family of 4, with my husband and two daughters (both 12). We absolutely loved this dinner - it was one of the best we've had in a long time, and we've eaten at numerous 3* Michelin restaurants all around the world. They are thoughtful about the flavor of each dish and how it all comes together, without being pretentious. We especially loved the carp, the Mangalitsa pork, the nonalcoholic juice pairings, and the local German wines. They take humble ingredients and make them magical via alchemy - every dish was spectacular in its flavor, and the portion sizes perfect - we were full without the overfull, bloated feeling at the end of the meal. We loved the local German elements they incorporated into the meal - most of the ingredients are from local farmers and producers, although they are not fanatical about this and the emphasis really is on quality and making the meal fantastic. Service was great - very friendly and thoughtful without being intrusive in any way.

2023-07-25,Food lover,"It was our third visit in the last two years. We arrived with memories of very tasty food, but also of slow service. We hoped to see improvement on that front, but unfortunately, our experience did not start or end well.  We waited for an amuse-bouche for almost 40 minutes, which was quite long, and we had expected quicker service. The first appetizer was served after another half hour, and the waiting time between meals remained long throughout the diner. It was at least twice the time that would be acceptable. After more than three hours, I mentioned the issue to the (otherwise very pleasant and friendly) waiters, but it had no effect on the pace of service. It took us over 5 hours to complete the 11-course meal. Moreover, the lack of air conditioning made the environment very hot, especially during a hot summer day.  While I thought the food was nice, I would definitely not repeat the experience again. I discreetly emailed my comments to the restaurant the next day, and I received a reply after two weeks. They apologized and mentioned delayed reconstructions, and they expressed hope that we would be fully satisfied next time. Bad excuse, because no one mentioned anyting during our reservation, upon arrival or when paying the bill. Not to mention that this was our third ‘slow’ experience, and that portable air conditioners are now sold at a lower price than the cost of a single dinner.   However, after careful discussion with other guests who were also present, we decided that three opportunities were enough. A Michelin-starred restaurant should provide a full service experience, not just good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r905563585-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en

Poor selection of wines by the glass for such an expensive restaurant.  Describing tannins in white wine (?!) is almost alarming.  Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.

The house is nothing special from the outside, nor is it inside, but it is poorly heated space - maybe they don't have firewood?!. The 3.5-hour time consuming food service consists of surrealistically small portions with a quasi-artistic touch and a high price. The “Michelin star” is vulgarly exploited to find the upper limit of guests ’naivety & stupidity. It all looks like a bad joke. To be able to separate the dish from the decoration, the staff constantly explains the composition of the miniature food brought on small pedestals. I also saw the head chef at the next table, he was quite a big guy - I thought - he probably eats somewhere else. The wine is good but nothing special.

This last visit disappointed us so much, the restaurant sadly decided to minimize their portions and also the atmosphere changed.  Plates in summer 2021, post second covid lockdown, aren’t what they were in 2020 or even before. I would estimate they are 3 times smaller now!  We’ve been offered 2 pieces of bread throughout the evening, which is borderline insulting, the staff didn’t ask - not even once - if we are satisfied with the food, not even at the end when we left.  Food was mediocre, but most of all - it was tiny. 7 tiny plates for 60 euros, every plate consisted of maximum 2 bites with the main course being a joke. A small piece of fish.  So hungry now we are going for a take out, after spending 150 euros for nothing - a few bites!!

The food was delicious and surprising from the first serving until recently. The combination of ingredients from local nature ingredients and dishes was amazing and sensational. We were very impressed by creativity, daring and imagination of the chef who served delicious and intriguing dishes and a right amount one by one. The dessert that combined yogurt, vanilla ice cream with delicate saltiness on a bed of pine scales and pine needles syrup was amazing.

The atmosphere was great - a pleasant buzz, friendly staff and good table spacing.   The food was at points phenomenal, sometimes excellent and occasionally good.   The bone marrow, oysters and caviar was the best thing I’ve ever eaten.    The select wine pairing was a mixed bag.   Some wines were perfect but also stood on their own and others needed the food to work.    Service was friendly and efficient.  It was really nice to see the chefs working. And also delivering the food explanations.   So what was odd.  Minor points but there were misses such as a sticky table, wine going missing and messy aprons on servers.   So this felt like an excellent meal delivered in a friendly place and therefore not quite perfection.

2024-09-25,princess and pea,"After seeing its third Michelin star awarded we made a special journey from London for dinner at L’Enclume. We have never been so disappointed by a three star restaurant.  The first five appetisers were delicious, promising a wonderful meal.  From then on it went rapidly downhill, every dish being either much too salty or dominated by an aggressive pickled vegetable flavour. By the end of the meat course I had an unpleasant taste in my mouth I could not shake off.   Such a shame.  The service was outstanding, the project management left us in awe and the cooking was incredibly precise, well up to the standards we have seen at Moor Hall, the Ledbury and Core. Whoever had the idea to ruin all this with clumsy seasoning and inappropriate sequencing of similar-tasting dishes scarcely deserves a single Michelin star.

As soon as you walk in you are met by one of the many truly wonderful, friendly warm staff members who immediately do everything they can to make your visit special. This isn’t a stuffy over priced restaurant, it’s a wonderful experience of amazing food, fantastic wines and engaging staff. I honestly can’t compliment the staff enough. They were all extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, wines, produce and history of the building.  I now get to say I’ve  licked my plate in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, in front of one of the staff and I was absolutely egged on by them (it isn’t something I’ve ever done in any restaurant let alone my own home but it was hilarious).    There were so maybe fabulous courses to try that picking just one favourite is too hard and I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who likes to be surprised.

2024-07-09,John G,"Our “Break in the Lakes” has been fortunate enough to allow us to experience this Restaurant - one of only nine in the UK to have 3 Michelin Stars.   We didn’t expect to be able to get a reservation at such short notice but we were pleasantly surprised when we did - only a few days before.   L’Enclume (French for “The Anvil”) has the feel of a top class establishment when you arrive, with a discreet entrance and a minimalistic layout.   Throughout the evening you can experience a cast delivering top quality service and food to match. Unlike the Fat Duck this is all about the dishes and the locally sourced ingredients, if you an “experience” then head a few hundred miles south to Bray - this cannot be compared to that.   Nevertheless this meets the objective of a unique and memorable meal - and the wine flight to accompany each course is recommended, the Sommelier will ensure you leave educated and tipsy!   So, why a 4/5 rating? For the price of the evening it didn’t quite meet expectations. Perhaps the Michelin Star “Rogan & Co” option that Simon has literally just down the road in Cartmel may have been a better fit for us (and our budget). If we do come back we’ll try that one next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499539-d800663-r958818417-L_Enclume-Cartmel_Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,4,en

2024-04-16,Jack,"Picture a residential neighborhood where you would probably not start a restaurant; then picture a street in that neighborhood where you would be quite unlikely to start a restaurant. That is however precisely where this three-star restaurant is located. The philosophy behind it all, just as the fully zen private dining rooms with tatami mats - I assume - is the full and undivided focus should be on the dinner. And: it delivered. The food is season bound and, at times, surprising. While some of the dishes we had were ‘just’ great Japanese food, two of the twelve dishes we had were truly magnificent.

2019-09-22,O Tter,"I have developed the theory that very good restaurants are frequently divisive. There will be many diners that love a good restaurant and leave glowing reviews. Others will simply not like the concept and, having potentially paid a very great deal of money for an experience that did not hit the spot, will leave poor reviews. Looking at a couple of recent reviews for Kashiwaya, it seems that this is the case here.  For my part, this is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten in. As my son said, it would almost be worth the journey from London to Osaka simply to visit this restaurant. It is expensive but, equally, you get what you pay for.  As far as I could see, the restaurant comprises a collection of private dining rooms and we were shown to a delightful space upstairs. Decoration is traditional Japanese with cloth covered walls and a tatami mat floor. The table was close to the floor but was placed over a pit (for want of a better expression ) into which your legs went, so that you could sit very comfortably on the floor.  The service is superb with an amazing sense of ceremony. Each time we were visited, typically by two or three of the staff, the door was slid open and they bowed outside before making their way to the table to serve us. Two of the staff members spoke a fair to good level of English and were perfectly well able to explain the various different courses and sake.  The food is exceptional and fully deserving of three Michelin stars. Inevitably I enjoyed some course more than others but all were good. I especially like the 'moon' theme than ran through the dinner and inspired many of the courses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r711835114-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en
2019-05-22,Natakrit N.,"I went to this restaurant after another 3 stars restaurant Hajime, which I was very happy with. So I expected some surprising tastes and textures but it was a disappointment.  The food didn't worth a detour nor flying to dine here. The food tasted just like it looked. I mean raw fish tastes like raw fish but I expected them to do something with the ingredients and turned out to be something unexpected in terms  of flavors and textures. They tried to serve the best seasonal ingredients using Japanese cooking. No offense but you can imagine authentic Japanese cooking, which tend not to add much flavor to ingredients resulting in very mild flavor food, which I could have it elsewhere in Kyoto. I expected more than this from 3 stars Michelin and I know what kind restaurants to look for now. I love to be excited and surprised.   So if you want an above average authentic Japanese restaurant, this restaurant maybe for you but if you  are looking for something surprising, it's not for you. The decorations were like small old Japanese room and 2 small tables, which could only fit 2 persons and it was a little bit uncomfortable for me but I like how it's a private room. Also it's about 4,200 yen taxi drive from Namba.  The dish I enjoyed the most was in the attachments. It's called Mizumono - Fruit balls with honey jelly. It was a very fun dish with different flavors of peeled fruit balls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r675650495-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,3,en
2018-10-17,JFenton1,"Of all the Michelin Star restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, this was the restaurant we were most excited about. I’m really bummed to have to write this review... On paper, 3 Michelin Stars, Relais Chateaux, $400 per person... It sounded like the meal of a lifetime, right? NOT. The restaurant has many rooms, most of which are tatami floor seating style. We were led to what looked like an interrogation room with a table large enough for 10 people, 2 Western chairs, no artwork on the walls and dated decor. Not even old charm Japanese, just old and frankly creepy. No music and the incessant sliding door opening and closing with a rusted metallic sound... We were totally creeped out. We had to start playing a little background music from our phones to get a some kind of atmosphere. Rude of us? Maybe, but I swear, the room had this awful fluorescent lighting, not at all the “cocoon feel” I had read about in the reviews.  THE FOOD: just plain boring. No flavors, nothing exciting at all. Is the Chef so well known that he keeps getting the ratings he received 20 years ago?  The sake/wine tasting at $90 per person consisted of $12 bottles anyone could find at the corner supermarket. Not good at all.  Service was lovely. Therefore my giving the place 2 stars.   We walked out of there, thanked everyone politely and burst into laughter once in the taxi. Never have I spent $900 on a meal for 2 that was so below average. Not to mention the restaurant is a 45 minute drive from the center of Osaka.   SO DISAPPOINTING.

2018-05-23,mike g,"in other words, this will be one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat. why? let me count the ways:  (1) the peaceful setting in a traditional tatami mat room (with a seat and room for legs below the just-above-floor-level table, for the less flexible or more long-legged among us) in a traditional house incongruously next to a freeway in an otherwise quiet mid-north osaka neighbourhood.  (2) the gracious and welcoming greeting on arrival - and, depending on how busy they are, possibly even from grand chef hideaki matsuo and/or his wife proprietress katsuko matsuo.  (3) the unobtrusive, professional yet empathetic service throughout the time at kashiwaya - in our case, for all four hours of our visit.  (4) and, of course, that ""harmonious culinary meditation"" befitting of a restaurant with those coveted three michelin stars...all 12 courses so beautifully designed for the eye, so carefully prepared for the fragrance and flavour and texture.   we were fortunate enough to have visits from the head chef and proprietress during our meal. they kindly explained the back stories involved in choosing the food items and combinations, the preparation and presentation - and the relationship with topics ranging from historical  traditions to the season and even the day's weather.  in the TripAdvisor article i wrote following a visit a year ago i explained more about the back stories and a little bit about the head chef's relationship with food when he's not at the restaurant, so i won't repeat those details here (like his favourite food, and what he does if he's invited out for a meal which wasn't as good as it might have been).   in the attached photo montages of our lunch, i've included the menu we enjoyed - ""Aotsuyu - rain dropping among leaves"" and indeed it was lightly raining that day.   this was only my second three-michelin-star restaurant experience (the other was in paris). but it certainly was an experience to savour, in all senses of the word.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r582321080-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

We were well received when arrived and led to a big room. I was surprised as there was only two of us. We were served by 2 waitresses and one of them explained the ingredients of every dish. It was so peaceful in the room and we could not hear any noise outside. The course we chosen was named “Spring morning”. The food was nicely placed on utensils which became pieces of beautiful artwork.  I must mention the  wine pairing. It was a surprise that red wine was also on the list yet a terrific match with Japanese food. My only comment is that if I were a vegetarian, the food was unbeatable.

2018-04-03,Dag I,"Three star restaurants in Japan are always surprising. Either they are chock full of molecular experiments and nordic inspiration (from Noma), or they are very close to something like the traditional Keiseki. This is clearly in the latter category. Al guest are given private rooms, and all are served a set menu consisting of 12-14 courses. A drinking pairing consisting mostly of top notch sake is highly recommended. Tables are traditional in the low style, but there is room for legs underneath, so have no fear of sitting straight on the floor. The food is served at a calm pace, brought by three waiters in traditional dresses. Food is traditional, praising the spring and cherry blossoming when we were there, but with some interesting twists. The whole seance takes almost three hours, but gee how fast time passes. At 90000 + yen for two persons, it is not exactly cheap, but this is not the place to visit if you are on a tight budget.

A phone call confirmed that the phone had been found, and next thing I knew, the proprietress, Mrs. Matsuo, was on her way by train from Osaka to Kyoto to deliver the phone to my hotel.  I did not even have a chance to thank her when she arrived around midnight, bearing also a gift of chirimenjako from the restaurant, as she left immediately to take the train back.  I may forget my phone again, but I will never forget this amazing service.  The food was of course excellent, but I would like to point out the unusual offer of a matching menu of various sake and two wines.

2017-07-28,mike g,"“Hassun: Conger eel cooked in sake, pickled Japanese ginger, green taro stem, simmered octopus with jade cucumber with ginger vinegar and macrophyll oil [from a type of leaf found in ferns and seed plants], fresh urchin, squid stings, Japanese green leaves.” That was just one of the 12 courses on offer when I visited Osaka’s Kashiwaya, with its three Michelin stars. Japanese food is famous for its fascinating and healthy variety. And nowhere is this more evident than at Kashiwaya. So hearing the backstory about a restaurant and its food can really enhance the dining experience. Hideaki Matsuo, 53, Proprietor and Grand Chef, and his wife Katsuko, Proprietress, earned their third Michelin star in 2011. They opened a sister restaurant in Hong Kong in 2015 and by last year it had already received its first Michelin star. One of the signature dishes is “fluffy” melt-in-your-mouth lobster. Chef Matsuo uses the shell in the broth and steams it for a long time. It took him six hours to come up with this dish, from inspiration to completion.  He develops dishes according to the seasons and also tradition. For example, with the approach of a hot summer, in old times the Japanese emperor gave away ice to his subjects to beat the summer heat and wish them good health. So when summer approaches Kashiwaya serves dishes that reflect this tradition with, for example, the appearance of ice. Unsurprisingly Matsuo is both head chef at the restaurant and also head chef at home, where he likes to prepare everyday food that’s quick and easy to cook.  He often chooses dishes his mother made – and takes photos of them to send her to show he still cooks what she made for the family. His favourite food? Fried prawns.  When friends invite the couple for a meal, even if it’s basic food what matters to them are the fresh ingredients and preparation, the intention to provide a good meal. Even if the food happens to be bad, Matsuo said he has been taught never to leave anything on the plate. At Kashiwaya, guests also never leave anything on their plates. But for all the right reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r506612572-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

You will have a stylish and traditional Japanese room to yourself , even if you are on your own .  The hospitality one receives right at the start indicates probably something special is coming . And there it appears , a few minutes later . The smiles and courtesy of the few Japanese girls serving you are unbeatable.  The first course will melt you already , not quite because of the taste , texture and material used , but also due to the artistic presentation .  What comes afterwards convince you that Michelin doesn't give 3 stars easily and your taste buds and eyes are constantly entertained to the utmost .  A dish with jelly and shrimps inside was actually outshone by the arrangement and the color of the food as well as the design of the ceramics . The whole presentation glows and one keeps on wondering how so much time and effort have been spent on just one dish .   The overall price ( without counting the sake ) is around Yen 25000, a most reasonable amount when one considers that the ambience , service , food , arrangement and effort put into the show are superb .

However, for a 3* restaurant, the ambiance and experience leave much to be desired.  We were seated in a small, cramped basement.  For me or my wife to rise from the table, the waitstaff had to come and move the table so we could get up.  There were plenty of times when our water or wine glasses ran dry, the crumbs were not cleaned from our tablecloth, my wife's napkin wasn't folded when she left the table, and several other minor things that would not matter at all were we not used to better experiences at other 3* places.

2024-05-23,Helmut,"NOTE: the rating given is relative to other 3 Michelin star restaurants I have eaten at worldwide.   Alain Passard is a genius when it comes to flavors. To me, this was the 3-star surprise of the evening: At times underwhelming looking dishes that, when tried, were an explosion on the palate. Using freshly-farmed in-season vegetables are key to the flavors. The chef merely combines them in the most perfect way. Still, I expected more out of the ordinary for a 3-star restaurant and, to be honest, some dishes – based on looks and technique – would easily be served at any average restaurant. Take for example the salad. Completely unassuming until you try the dressing. A shout out goes to the bread, because it was truly amazing. As such, I am a little torn here with my rating and will knock off one point.   The place is tiny but with a cute decor. However, the compact place also means a lot of traffic from the service staff. As there is no loop through the dining area, there is no way for the staff to move graciously between the tables. This means often staff leaving some guests unattended. My biggest complaint was in regard to the front of house timing. Someone would bring out a plate from the kitchen. It would be placed on a cart for inspection. It often would sit there alone, unattended, until the right server would spot it, pick it up and deliver it. Pretty poor communication if you ask me. Even worse, more than once was I sitting dry with food on the plate and no wine in the glass. The wine and food timing was completely off.   Other small mistakes, such as not adjusting my napkin after I excused myself for the wash room, a slice of bread that was put on my plate and then taken back to the tray after I declined on more bread, and the fact that my coat could not be found are mistakes that should never happen in a 3-star place. It is clear to me that the chef lives in his kitchen, but front of house are running around without clear marching orders or supervision. For this I am knocking off another point.   If you love food and amazing flavors and can look beyond some of the front of house faux pas, then by all means do not skip L'Arpege. But if you are a stickler expecting crazy dishes that wow you visually it is best you stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r951997329-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,3,en

2024-04-28,vincybie,"  Recently, my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to dine at the renowned three Michelin star restaurant, Arpège in Paris. As vegetarian on that day, we were excited to explore the vegetarian-friendly options this establishment had to offer. However, our experience fell short of our expectations due to various factors that left us feeling dissatisfied and overcharged.  Unwelcoming Start:  Upon our arrival, we found the restaurant door closed, After peering inside, we noticed someone standing there, seemingly aware of our presence. To our surprise, the lady asked us to return 30 minutes later as the restaurant was ""not ready"" , leaving us feeling unwelcome.   The Price Shock:  While waiting, we decided to pass the time at a nearby café. Curiosity led us to browse the restaurant's website, where we discovered the exorbitant prices associated with each dish, particularly the set menu. The steep cost gave us pause and ultimately led us to contemplate canceling our reservation. Unfortunately, we discovered that the cancellation fee was a staggering 1000 Euros, leaving us feeling trapped.  Underwhelming Main Course:  Once seated and served, we found that the complimentary appetizers were the highlight of our meal. However, I was disappointed by the limited options for vegetarian main courses. The sole vegetarian dish I chose resembled the complimentary raw vegetable platter we had, albeit cooked and caramelized. Regrettably, it tasted more like a warm dessert rather than a satisfying savory main course. It was disheartening to leave my main dish unfinished, especially considering the hefty price tag of 155 Euros for a plate consisting of only ten small pieces of steamed vegetables. This is not the first time I had vegetarian dishes at 1 to 3 Michelin Star world wide.   Lackluster Dessert Experience:  Despite expressing our fullness to the server, we were persuaded to order two kinds of desserts to share. We requested half-sized portions, but even then, we were unable to finish a single dessert. The unappetizing experience with the desserts further contributed to our overall dissatisfaction. In an attempt to minimize waste, we decided to take the complimentary desserts with us and later gifted them to a homeless woman with a beautiful dog the following day.  Unpleasant Surprise:  As we were preparing to leave, to our astonishment, our table server opened a new bottle of water without seeking our consent. The additional charge for the unrequested water was an unwelcome surprise, further adding to our growing disappointment.  Conclusion:  Our experience at Arpège, though highly anticipated, turned out to be a letdown.

Service from start to finish was professional and friendly. Both our waiter snd sommelier were terrific. Had the  ala carte menu was very vegetable heavy and refreshingly light. Dover sole and apple tarte were especially memorable. Very much a Michelin starred experience.

2024-02-07,daniel snyder,"I had a delightful and amazing time today at Arpege.  I had left the Rodin Museum today, my first day out in Paris after recovering from flu.  I was searching for a restaurant and entered Arlene, asking if they had a table for myself.  the greeter was smiling, friendly, and welcoming!  I was seated with Simon, the waiter, and he and the kitchen went above and beyond....the food was PURE ART and the taste of the many dishes was PURE HEAVEN!!!!  I knew I was in a rarefied culinary world when ordering herbal tea, they wheeled in pots full of gorgeous herbs for me to select.  my main plate was scallops encased in bay leaves with a lobster sauce.  I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant.  and, being a 3 star Michelin restaurant, they are so relaxed and pleasant, even while being attentive.  every time I think of my lunch today, a warm, cozy smile shines from my heart. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r937347196-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2024-01-30,Barbara J,"My husband and I dined at Arpege on 26th Jan to celebrate my 50th birthday. Unfortunately, the diner is memorable for its utter mediocrity.  I was reluctant to try L'Arpege given its mixed reviews and should have followed my instinct. We dined at the one star Qui Plume la Lune the previous night and it was superb. I don't normally write reviews but would like to prevent others – especially vegetarians –  from bothering with this tired lazy restaurant. I have been a vegetarian for 38 years and dined in many 3 star, 2 star and 1 star restaurants throughout the world so feel qualified to judge L'Arpege. The service was unfocused and casual to the point of sloppy (wine glasses were uncleared, service was not attentive etc.) The menu was what one might expect from a farm restaurant in that the produce was good quality but sloppy in presentation and not remotely creative in combination of flavours.The vegetarian selection of dishes (there is no vegetarian set menu option any more) did not cohere  together. The chef seems to expect diners to be impressed by his egg starter that he's been serving for nearly 30 years. Haute vegetarian dining has moved on. Diners should too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r936120759-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,1,en
2024-01-18,Fab',"Extremely creative cuisine. As expected for a proper 3-stars, you get transported in a unique world, in the chef's vision. For many things, you can't tell if it's good or if it's bad, simply because this is something you've never experienced nor tasted before. You just drop a tear and you ask for more.  The servings are very generous and even for a large eater like me, finishing the meal was becoming a challenge.  The service is extremely classy and professional, as well as the attire of the servers. As expected, the wine list is telescopic and only the help of the sommelier can properly guide you through the best pairing.  We will point the attention brought to single travelers who are greeted with a comic book explaining the chef's vision, work and the dishes. That makes time fly.  The imitation of the classic ""sauce beurre blanc"" (white butter sauce) is extraordinary. I only experienced such experiment in another 3-stars.  Overall, all aspects of the French cuisine are here and mastered: vegetables, plants, meat, fish, traditional, modern, creative, etc… and all is well executed. No molecular cuisine or nitrogen artefacts here. In fact, what surprises the most is that the dishes seem so simple and the list of ingredients seem so short that you feel you could do it yourself; only until you taste what is presented to you. Another thing that surprises is that ingredients that seem not to go together are married, and the result is out of this world.   The lower room I was in is decorated with real flowers put on a wall looking like a painting canvass. Never seen before and you can spend long minutes looking at it in details.  You clearly are in the world of an artist who's very dedicated. For example, one of the components of one of the starters is turnip. The chef has experimented the same turnip seed, planted at the same time in 3 of his gardens disseminated across this part of France, and then found out that the end-result will give 3 different products. Based on that he will choose what seems to be the best for him.  The old-time hot-cold egg is a wonder of creativity and craftsmanship by the mastery of required technicality for the cooking, and perfect timing for the serving; indeed, if you wait too long for eating it, the surprising hot-cold effect is no longer there.  If there is one small negative thing to mention: be warned that you have to park yourself. No valet, no dedicated parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r934576453-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2023-11-11,Mehdi M,"I would recommend the restaurant for its food. I came to the Arpege to taste the vegetables of Alain Passard, and I am not disappointed.    - The plate of amuse-bouche made of slide root vegetables and little shells was simple but well presented. The taste was on point. - The classic Arpege egg was delicious as expected. - Another classic: the vegetable dumplings were superb. The broth was especially excellent with notes of celery. - the ""sushi"" with kalamata olives was well balanced and well executed. I appreciate that the chef took into consideration my dislike for cheese and provided this dish instead. - the squash soup with the sage whipped cream was excellent. The texture was silky smooth and buttery. I would have liked nice quenelle of cream rather than a rustic looking scoop. - the leek and pear with a very interesting dish. The associate worked perfectly. The note of pepper on top were what needed to elevate this dish. The leeks provided some welcome mache. - The quenelle of scallop and truffle was a surprise since I was expecting only vegetable. It was delicious nonetheless. The parsnip? and truffle cream was again silky smooth and the crunch of the fresh truffles balanced this very well. - The beet tartare, another classic was on point and the mustard carrot condiment worked so well with it. A great dish. - the final savory dish was my least favorite of all. While I was impressed by the cooking of each winter vegetable, the sweet and sour sauce was not to my liking. The buttery taste was too overpowering for me. - the hazelnut souffle was great. A great balanced of nutty and smooth chocolate flavors. - another classic, sweet this time. the flower apple tarte. Great touch of tartness here and there and nice puff pastry. The caramel was unexpectedly sour.  - the plate of migniardises was well assorted. The vanilla whisky macarons will be remembered.  The small size of the room and the large and necessary numbers of staff make the dining room feel cramped and crowded at all time. The constant back and forth of the staff (again necessary) made us difficult for us to stay focused on the food and conversation. Would we have been seated at the different table (other than the little square table behind the entrance) it might have been different. This will be difficult to improve because it is due to the size of the dining room.  The staff was professional and understanding at all time. However, service is the area that could use some improvements. - I made a 12pm reservation but the door was closed at noon and opened 4-5 min later. - The waitress who greeted us at our table had a stained on her jacket lapel. That should not happen at the beginning of a service. - We chose the vegetable lunch menu. We explained that we were not ""heavy"" drinkers and that we would go with wine by the glass. Since we did not know what we will be eating, we asked for recommendations and the answer we got was that people usually go with white. We were a bit surprised back the lack of depth of the answer. - The choice given for aperitif was not large. Since we declined champagne (because we do not like bubbly wine and I will come back to that) we were provided with only one option: a glass of chardonnay. We decided to give it a little bit of thought. Once my spouse returned from the restrooms, the waitress asked us if we were ready for our glass of wine. It felt that we did not have other choice than to accept it. That was a bit pushy - We appreciate that one of our waiters asked about the pace of the meal we would like to adopt. We gladly enjoy the little wait between dishes. The overall experience lasted for four hours and did not feel like it. It was well paced. - My wife being American, the staff talked to us in English. Hearing the descriptions of the dishes and other interactions with customers, I found out that we missed on numerous details. Should we come back, we will ask for the French version and I will translate for my wife. - Coming back to the champagne, when the bill was given to us, I noticed that a glass of champagne was mistakenly charged instead of an aperitif wine. While we appreciate the commercial gesture of offering us the water, we should be able to trust such establishment to get the bill right without having to check it. However, I am glad I did.  The menu was reasonably priced with outstanding produce and impeccable attention to detail. The extra like coffee and water were quite expensive. The pours of wine or digestives could be a bit more generous. I went to similar establishments outside Paris, where generosity was of primary importance. Unfortunately, it seems that it is a trait of province and not Paris. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r925557870-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,4,en
2023-08-24,Loulwa_Kaloyeros (Assaker),"I was treated to an amazing experience on my 60th birthday. This was a memorable lunch from start to finish. We opted for the surprise lunch menu of 11 dishes and added a main - we had the Dover sole and the sweetbreads. We spent over 3 hours being entertained with one dish after the other of utter delight and deliciousness. All the plates were full of flavor, pieces of art and an ode to vegetables. We also had several iconic dishes such as the egg which has been on the menu for 37 years! How can an egg be so tasty?? We also had the beetroot tatare with its condiments. And since tomatoes and lovage are in season, the gaspacho, minestrone (with eel) and the sushi exposed the elegance of this fruit. The highlight of the dessert was the chocolate millefeuille. In 60 years I have never seen this baked to perfection. It was sublime. A gastronomic delight. Everything was served with a lot of elegance - the staff balanced professionalism with a sweet human touch. The sommelier was such an expert (lots of natural wines) who catered to our desires. The finale was a beautiful plate of sweets and tarts that we asked to take home. The whole experience was remarkable. And yes maybe the restaurant is small but it felt very intimate. The sounds from the kitchen audible as the doors opened but this also made the experience genuine. Yes it is expensive but for a 3 star Parisian restaurant of this calibre a lunch menu for 185 € is really a great deal (eleven dishes!). Thank you Alain Passard for giving vegetables a royal treatment and for tantalizing our palates with amazing French produce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r912656878-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

2023-07-04,nick164,"Arriving on a drizzly Parisian winter's evening 5 minutes before my reservation time, I found the door locked. A staff member looked blanky through the window before finally opening the door. Having advised them I had a reservation they then indicated they were not yet open and left me on the street until 731pm. An appalling initial impression, noting this is not a hotel restaurant with a pleasant foyer to wait.   If I knew what was to come, I would have just left.   The decor is pleasant. The dining room felt quite crowded, with the table being located next to the busy kitchen and its squeaky door. Dietary and allergy requirements provided at the time of booking were forgotten. Whilst the majority of dinners were English speaking, the menu is still not available in English. And most disappointingly for this once renowned vegetarian restaurant is that the menu no longer even has a vegetarian selection.  Having opted for the 5-course, the waiter initially continued a 'hard sell' for the 12-course before just proceeding to outline his favourite dishes that could be adapted as vegetarian. On enquiring on a degustation, the Sommelier just thrust a menu and advised they don't offer one. I requested 3 wines by the glass to match the 5 courses.  The recommended wines were ok, but the supposed Sommelier's abilities were poor. Having recommended a wine, it arrived with the very limited introduction of ""this is a Sauvignon Blanc"" before just walking off - there was a little improvement over time but not much.  In terms of the food: - No butter or olive oil was provided with the bread. - The amuse bouche was nice, but being advised to stir it would have made the difference. - The first course of dumplings was very tasty. - The second course of onion gratin with truffle smelled good but was effectively a plate of onion with shaved truffle and greenery atop. - The third course of beet tartar was very nice. - The fourth course of leek and truffle was, similar to the onion, a plate of leek just hidden under some truffle. - The fifth course was a plate of favourless vegetables in a sauce.   The 'cheese board' was a block of Comte. Bizarrely for a tasting course, all courses were savoury - with dessert then being an additional cost. Dessert options then proposed included those I was allergic too.  Service was poor. There are lots of staff, yet most plates went uncleared for some time. I failed to finish multiple dishes yet only on the last did the waiter enquire. Upon asking for the bill, the waiter advised the fifth course would be deducted.  Most definitely not recommended. I visit Paris a couple of times a year and I will not be back to Arpege. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r900393895-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,2,en

The first evening we had the standard menu and the second we had the 5 course menu. The food was well presented and good quality with some interesting and attractive ideas. The building is simply refurbished with nice decorative items in tune with the school theme. Our accommodation was on two levels with the sleeping area up a steep staircase. It was simply furnished. Overall it was an enjoyable stay but I think that the charges are a bit expensive for what it was.

The layout is modern and sophisticated with bar seating surrounding the kitchen, enabling diners to view the cooking and plating process prior to service. There is also booth seating for larger groups. The menu is complex and modern, and changes every couple of months to match availability of fresh ingredients. We had the 14 course tasting menu, which was superb in every way. Of all the many restaurants I have been to in Shanghai, this is by far the best.

2024-03-03,Maria K,"That was so far the most expensive and overpriced dining (I would not dare to say ""fine"") experience I ever had in Vienna.  Had to remind the waiters twice about the drink we ordered (actually, to refill the wine).  We went for a vegan meal. Everything was overdone with either vinegar, or lemon, which made the food loose its taste. Some of the dishes (like cabbage we gave up on finishing) is simply hard to cut and share, leave alone the opportunity to dine with someone who is not your close family or couple. Would not come back or recommend going. Ended up paying 150 euro for two which is extremely over-prised for a dark-corner table without a warmer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190454-d2524649-r940698300-Tian_Restaurant_Wien-Vienna.html,3,en

2022-04-18,CavKA,"So firstly, let me be transparent on the review; the cost was SHOCKINGLY high.  Yes, we saw (in advance) that it was going to be 140 Euros per person but the end bill, including tip was 450.  We had 5 glasses of wine between us (and there were 2 of us).  One has to pause and ask, unless money is no object, is anything worth this?  Of course the answer can be yes, but this just was not.  The size of each of the courses was small (except back to the roots, which had a variety).  I did not leave hungry but not filled either.  When we went, there were a few radish dishes (not my favorite veg) but then some tasty ones as well.  It really was a mix.  I have been to some amazing vegetarian places in NYC (including AbcV) which, quite frankly, knocks this one out of the park and about a 1/3 less  (and we are talking NYC here...).  So we did this once but would not go back.  If money is not an obstacle, then go.  Last thing is that the restaurant had this track in the background that was just odd music considering the vibe...it was a place that screamed for jazz or blues or something and it was like 1980s/90s hits...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190454-d2524649-r835004816-Tian_Restaurant_Wien-Vienna.html,3,en

2024-05-14,craigodile,"This is a review of Mirazur's Sydney pop-up restaurant. It was an absolute rort. Immediately below are my grievances. Below my grievances are my attempts to get in touch with the restaurant before leaving this review. It's farcical. They have been nothing short of dishonest and their behaviour, even since since dinner, has been unacceptable. I'm in touch with some of the food review journalists here (Good Food Guide) about the whole experience.  Context is that my wife and I live in Perth and travelled to Sydney for Mirazar, which is a five hour flight. We stayed in a nice hotel. The whole evening probably cost over $6k, but we were genuinely excited to try the restaurant. They charged the same, I believe, as if you were eating in Menton. The head chef did not come out, or at least he was not there the night we dined. And they were only there for about three weeks.  We previously lived in Sydney for six years (me) and 10 years (her), so understand the place.  I also mention Noma below. They did a pop up in Sydney and they did it right. Closed doors in Copenhagen, spent about three months researching the local produce and tailoring a menu, and Rene Redzepi came out for the duration. How do I know? I had a gin and tonic with him after our lunch service.  Anyway, here we go...  1) The Gantry is not a fine dining location. It’s a mid-range restaurant/hotel. If you’d have asked almost anybody in Sydney they’d have told you this. Their “water views” are of a relatively dirty stretch in between two wharves of the Hickson Road Wharves. Did Mr Colagreco ever see it? Did anybody do any due diligence? 2) Remaining with the restaurant itself and there’s honestly a pedestrian walkway going right through the dining area. It seems the hotel had maybe kept the rights to the actual waterfront tables and chairs, but we had runners passing within inches of our table. Runners! Sweaty, panting runners going right through the “world’s best restaurant”. And multiple people just out for a stroll.  3) How many staff members did you actually bring out? We’re only confident one was from Mirazur, a lovely Italian girl serving us. But watching her prepare the butter was a joke. It was like she’d watched a YouTube video 5 minutes before. I don’t think this is a reflection on her, she seemed genuinely embarrassed, more on the last minute prep by the powers that be at the restaurant. 4) Perhaps we heard wrong, but we’re pretty sure our sommelier said he’s the hotel’s sommelier. Is that correct? You didn’t even bring out one of your sommeliers? He was lovely, but nowhere near Michelin Standard. 5) Service was chaotic. Napkins left scrumpled on tables when we went to the bathroom, chairs not pulled out or pushed in when we sat down, cutlery pretty much thrown down on tables. We’d not long been to Zen in Singapore and the contrast was extraordinary. 6) Pacing! One of our waiters, and I can’t believe he’s yours, apologised about a third of the way in. He said dishes are coming out quickly now because the kitchen is quiet, they’ll slow down as they get busier. We smiled, but are you kidding? You pace the meal based on how busy the kitchen is? 7) Produce. When Noma came out they actually spent time researching produce. You didn’t. We had to listen to a spiel about David Blackmore’s Wagyu, like you’d just found this incredible producer. Within about 5 minutes of landing in Australia in 2014 (I’m originally from UK) I’d heard of David Blackmore’s Wagyu. It’s great, but shows you did no real research. Also his current best cut is from Rubia Gallega cows from Spain. It’s actually quite an interesting story and something that would have surprised many at dinner. Pretty much everything that was mentioned we’d heard of and were familiar with. 8) There’s more, but do I need to go on? It was a nice dinner (the apple and wasabi desert was particularly good), but an embarrassment otherwise when you consider your reputation and price point.  Now for the follow up...  I emailed the above to Mirazar and guess what? Completely ignored. Not even an acknowledgement of receipt. I leave it a couple of weeks and then follow up...guess what? Ignored. I ask my wife to email them, fictitiously asking about a reservation. Immediate reply. She says thanks, would you mind now replying to my husband. Busted! They don't email, they try and call (I suspect they don't want to put anything in writing). Given the time difference we had a game of telephone tennis and then I gave up. I suggested, given that I was either in bed when they called, or they were, we discuss by email. Ignored.  So there you go. A dreadful, dishonest experience. The restaurant in Menton, I'm sure, is delightful. But the organisation behind it is money grabbing and operating with impunity. AVOID their pop ups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r950834086-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,1,en

2024-03-02,Monica Hughes,"When it comes to attention to detail and staff there is no questions why Mirazur has the rating it does.   This was my first dining experience at a three Michelin Star restaurant. The staff was great and friendly and the food was fantastic. The menu changes periodically based on the season and what is grown in the garden. When I was there, it was a floral season and each dish had a floral taste to it from the actual flowers that were in there garden. It is a pretty amazing thing to experience eating something that someone may never have again since the menu changes so frequently.

2023-10-16,Sursock,"For the night before a special lady's Big Day: we held our very own Big Night at the Mirazur and delved into one of four culinary universes by Chef Mauro Colagreco.  To mark the occasion, rather than dine with the other guests, we were beckoned through a closed glass-door and walked down the aisle between two kitchens to be seated at an exclusive table between the sea-side balcony and the Mise en Place counters: temptation was within arm's reach of this table.  We were thrilled, the ouverture of tonight’s nine-course menu was just about to be plated. The chefs operated diligently in hushed tones without heeding to our party’s seating and the beginning of the festivities. The vivid colours, odd shapes and plating already whetted our appetites. And to be seated in close proximity to such a talented ensemble was awesome.  The night in question was a “Root day” and the proposed fixed-price menu was the Root Mirazur Universe. The three other menu creations are as follows: Leaf Mirazur Universe, Flower Mirazur Universe and Fruit Mirazur Universe. The day you choose to dine at the Mirazur determines the menu’s overarching theme. The chef adheres to biodynamic principles and follows the lunar calendar to pick from his own gardens the key-ingredients of the day.  Each proposed dish of the root menu was delicious, delightful to behold and generous in portion: family style. The nine-course menu was punctuated twice by breaking bread together and even molding our butter into corrugated columns of goodness. The service was perfection: from the sommelier’s recommendations for wine and dish pairings to the last-minute menu tweaks due to food restrictions (pork and vegetarian). Every one of us felt included and cared for. Of particular note, our maître d' in dinner service made the evening that much more memorable and engaging. She was welcoming, affable and charming.

2023-09-28,Dan T,"We were there for dinner. Overall it was a big disappointment. This place doesn't deserve its 3 Michelin stars (maybe one) or being anywhere in the top spots of La Liste.  I'll start with the positive parts: the view of Menton is superb. Some of the dishes we had were indeed very very good (the amuse-bouche, the Salade Marine with caviar, the Epinard Malabar Gamberoni from San Remo).  However there were many issues: - no tablecloths, shocking for the price they charge. The tables are too close to each other. - the service was sub-par (brasserie level). They forgot to pour the wine before bringing the plates, I ordered an extra glass of wine which arrived 30' later, they were clearing the plates and cutlery from the left. Lots of personnel in the dining room but very poorly coordinated. - my main concern, the plates became less and less enjoyable as we advanced through the menu. The aged tuna tartare with capucine could have been excellent, save that its taste was drowned by too much yuzu/ponzu spice on top. The salad with seafood sauce should not be served in any starred restaurant - just by the look of it its place is maybe in a brasserie. The lobster with marjolaine was ok but uninspiring. The hay-cooked fish with porcini could have been excellent - both the fish and the porcini shavings were superb; however, the cooked porcini was completely tasteless. The guinea fowl was bland, and it came with two ""satellite dishes"" that did not fit at all with the main dish. Finally the red cabbage-based desert was ""interesting"" but not a great way to close the dinner. - while comprehensive, the wine list has very limited choice between EUR 100-300. Prices are up to 5x store price for the wines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r918814253-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,2,en

2023-08-13,Gala L,"We went yesterday to celebrate my birthday, at the moment of the reservation I was told we would be seating in the “terrasse”, which was fine by me because I imagined it was just be a terrace adjacent to the main restaurant. When we arrived they took us to our table which was located in this sort of patio in the back of the restaurant between the road and the restaurant itself. The location would not be great for a pizzeria, but was unacceptable to say the least for a 3 star restaurant: the road is very trafficked and noisy and you can literally hear every single car passing a few meters from you. The only view you have (if you are lucky) is through the glasses of the main restaurant (literally you are looking through the windows of the restaurant in front of you, filled with people that are paying the same as you but are having a “normal” dining experience and not sitting in a backyard on the road). On top of it, at some point the bar across the road started playing very loud techno music, so loud that we could barely speak and we felt like being in a club. The staff was embarrassed and mortified and said that they had never played such loud music. We decided to give our feedback to the chef (who is the owner) in a very polite way and we were surprised by his answer that “we felt that way but other people love it”. It was clear he couldn’t care less about the guests but only cared about the extra cash that the table in the terrasse was bringing him. The terrasse was half full and still we estimate the 3 tables paid more than €3000 that night, this means that with one week of revenues the restaurant would cover the costs to do the works and integrate the terrace in the restaurant. Other than that, the food was very good but not mind blowing and I found bizarre that one fo the dishes was very similar to Carlo Cracco’s goat cheese filled ravioli with mushrooms (they were even the same colour) and the Guinea fowl was also very similar to Bottura’s “non roasted Guinea fowl”. BIZARRE to say the least. The only note of excellence goes to the staff which was lovely and caring and still made sure we had an enjoyable evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187231-d785504-r909945819-Mirazur-Menton_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,2,en

The food is hard to explain becuase it is both a work of art and a meal. Each flavor combination is carefully crafted and the presentations are, as I said, works of art. We had a lovely mix of items ranging from seafood to poultry and all sorts of things in between. If you are a wine drinker, their wine pairings are excellent as well. Everyone there is knowledgable about the food and drink options and takes the time to explain things to each guest. We've been one Michelin star restaurants before and I can see why Mirazur has three stars. If there was such a thing as more, they would earn them!

The restaurant was very comfortable and inviting  and the decor was aesthetically pleasing. The view was magnificent.   The staff was attentive and accommodating. Great service.   The food was all beautifully presented. But, in my humble opinion, most of the dishes lacked flavor.  The ingredients of the dishes did not seem to work well together. It was so disappointing from a taste perspective.  Unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants where the dishes exploded with flavor, I found that noticeably missing at Mirazur.    I appreciate the restaurant’s commitment to aligning the menu with nature, but I wish they would have spent as much effort on making the food delicious.   Whether eating at Mirazur is worth the price tag is a very personal decision. For me, it wasn’t and I regretted it.

The food was impeccably presented and perfectly cooked.  What elevates Miramar to another level are the quality of the wines, the sommelier was very knowledgable, and the extras - like the incredible cheese selection course.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the night we visited it was the ""leaves"" cycle and the dessert was a very disappointing dish with a strong seaweed flavor/theme on top of an Ice cream (?) that just did not work together.  The table next to us were also telling the waiter that they did not care for this dessert either although the waiter told them the kitchen would be willing to make something else.  For me, a bad dessert can put the damper on the entire meal.  This didn't do that but it was a letdown for sure.

Every single detail of our experience was carefully thought through, and well executed. The theme was flowers- the colours, artistry and creativity of each dish was incredible and much appreciated. The taste of the dishes was a different matter! Some combinations worked, many did not. I was very excited with the surprise presented with each course. Enjoyed many new discoveries - like the Yucca flower stuffed with crabmeat and almond foam, osmantus flower from Asia, cooked with langoustine- delicate and delicious! Loved the lobster skewered in a vanilla stick with celeriac, in a basket of flowers. The artichoke tart with truffles was delicious. The main dish of pigeon cooked very rare, presented with it’s  blood red colour upset me very much- I could hardly bring myself to eat it that rare. All the desserts were pretty to look at, but difficult to enjoy eating. It finished the meal badly for me. My husband was very unhappy with the meal- he found much of the tastes unacceptable. He wanted to leave as soon as dessert was served as he was in a bad mood. When we found our car positioned and ready to be driven away, we were most impressed by the thoughtfulness.  Service was very attentive and different stewards came with a dish to tell us the story of that dish. All members of their team were well trained and articulate, polished n polite n pleasant.

2024-02-18,Jurica H,"A very nice Saturday afternoon, for sure. Our meeting with this wonderful restaurant happened yesterday, Saturday, February 17, 2024. It was lunch as part of our Valentine's Day, since due to work we couldn't go over the week when Valentine's Day was. I found out about the restaurant, as well as everything else that is offered at the KORAK family estate, while researching the Internet. I wanted to take my love to a beautiful place and I chose KORAK. I didn't make a mistake. And my love was very satisfied and happy. The restaurant has a Michelin star, so I thought they must be great. And they were.   The restaurant is located on one of the hills of the Plješevica and offers a beautiful view of the surroundings. It is also the wine-growing region of Croatia with fine wines. I reserved a five-course menu. You can also reserve eight dishes menu, but these five were quite enough for the two of us. I must mention that you don't know what you ordered in those five courses, you just reserve the menu and everything that follows is a surprise. I think this is very interesting. The food from start to finish was phenomenal, imaginative, very tasty and beautifully arranged and served on plates. There was everything on our menu, from homemade cheese, homemade prosciutto, homemade butter in beeswax, homemade bread that is made in a special way, all the way to dishes like tortellini in a fine sauce with grated black truffle (which the staff grates in front of you). , lamb brisket with chickpeas, beautifully prepared squab with home-made grated horseradish and steamed shallots with plums, and a delicious even slightly salty caramel ice cream with toppings.....and some other interesting elements of our menu.  Everything was very tasty, beautiful to see and imaginative. For the first time in our life, my love and I ate sguab and it was nice and tasty, in fact we were positively surprised. The staff told us that they change the menu all the time, so if we come back a few more times, and we might from what we've seen, we'll eat some other food. Very interesting.   I have to praise the staff as well. They were very professional, polite and smiling, which is very important for a restaurant of this type. Each plate they brought us, that is, each course, was presented to us in an excellent way. They described to us what we were eating, how each element of the meal was prepared, with what technique, etc. Also their drinks that we drank, which was Chardonnay white wine and, at the very beginning, home-made apple cognac we also liked the staff gave information about where they came from, how everything was done, etc.   In the end, my recommendation if you are looking for a very nice place with great food and drinks. For the chef Mr. Korak and his staff all the praises and may they continue at the same pace. Maybe another Michelin star will come soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g812258-d21054079-r938778181-Korak_Winery-Jastrebarsko_Zagreb_County_Central_Croatia.html,5,en

The chef created such a crazy combination of tastes but still remained authentic to traditional cousine. The dinner was really really abondant and we were full by the desert. Nex time I will go slowly with the bread but since it was the best bread in the entire world I am not sure if one can avoid eating it. Each meal was accompanied by a story and a glass of wine, selected to match the meal.

If I had to pick the best, I'd have to settle for 2, the smoked trout  (because I *really* don't like eating fish, and this was amazing)  and Tortellini (because they are my favorite dish,  ever since my childhood and these were best I've eaten. Ever.

2024-01-02,Alberto V,"From a restaurant that has a green star, I would expect more ingredients to be of local origin, and then they serve me two dishes with the main ingredients from the sea (squid and monkfish). The kitchen did not deserve a Michelin star, and neither did the service. The only thing that deserves my praise is the view and the vintage wines because they are excellent. Over 250 euros per person (dish + wine) is far too much for what we got.

They have two greenhouses wherein they grow all of their produce, one smaller one adjacent to the restaurant and another offsite. This was one of the original ""farm-to-table"" establishments and we have been coming here for 20 years. De Kas NEVER disappoints. Service, ambiance, and especially the quality of the food are all 100% spot on. Sourdough bread and tapioca bread wonderful starters. Fresh radishes and tempura asparagus were our amuse-bouches. This was followed by the brightest, freshest gaspacho ever. I mean ever. Haddock the next course-sublime. Interestingly ( and it worked ) white asparagus was our main. We understand why white asparagus is so celebrated in northern Europe in the spring. No room for dessert, but it looked over the top. I believe it was a pound cake with fresh berries. These nice people know what they are doing. Special mential to our server Sharon. Lovely in every way.

We were sat down by a screaming toddler and asked to move which they kindly did and it was odd folks took little kids here due to the price point and it wasn't that early in the night when families with younger kids tend to go out. The whole area was staring at this table so it was not just us wondering why they didn't take steps to quiet or soothe their child. The couple next to where we were moved, came here once a year from far away for years and were very frustrated by it. Our meal was delicious and we had lovely wine along with it. My only quibble was perhaps it is cultural but the empty plates were left down a long time after we had finished. The place is massive and this could be due to being there on a Saturday night. The dish with truffle shavings was my favorite! Vegetables are the star here an the focus. There are meat and fish options but know you are going to have outstanding freshly grown vegetables prepared in inventive and delicious ways.

2024-10-24,Tecey,"Unfortunately the Inn at Little Washington's model of a multi-course meal of rich food is fundamentally flawed. While some of the dishes on the Gastronaut menu were delicious, it would have benefitted from dropping at least two of the courses, which would have made the meal more enjoyable. Sadly, the Gastronaut's menu was extremely disappointing with 3 of the dishes too salty, so much so that one of them was inedible. Since we were driving home afterwards, we tried the non-alcoholic wine but all three proved undrinkable. Overall, not the evening we had hoped for and definitely not worth the money.

Tip 2: Arrive around 30 minutes before your reservation time to experience the bar and explore the restaurant a bit. Interesting fun fact: I wasn't able to make out what the kitchen staff on the other side of the kitchen were shouting periodically. (The kitchen is big!) I was curious and followed up with an online inquiry the next day (having forgotten to ask our wonderful waiter), and received a prompt response: ""the kitchen sounds out 'here we are' to acknowledge that a guest is arriving or departing the kitchen.""

2024-09-02,jim t,"I initially hesitated to write this review, but I realized that every restaurant, regardless of its reputation, deserves honest feedback. My wife and I dined here for our anniversary, hoping for a memorable experience. Unfortunately, while the food was good, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. My wife’s entrée, a prosciutto-wrapped tenderloin, arrived lukewarm at best, which was disappointing.  However, the main reason for this review is the unsettling feeling we left with. The waitstaff’s demeanor made us feel as though we were a burden or had unknowingly offended them. We spent part of the evening and even the next day questioning if we had done something wrong. The only explanation we could think of was that we were among the last seatings of the night, and perhaps the staff had already mentally checked out.  When I spend nearly $1300 on a dinner, I shouldn't be left wondering if it was my fault that the service was subpar. In contrast, the previous night we dined at Three Blacksmiths and left with a sense of joy, eager to recommend it to friends and family. It was less than half the price, yet the service was far superior, and the food quality was on par. I’ve had better service at places like DC Prime or Morton’s.  Maybe I don’t fully understand what a 3-star Michelin rating signifies, but based on this experience, it didn’t seem to offer anything extraordinary. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant, as it did not feel worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r968047689-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,3,en

With every bite, we were transported to a place of pure enjoyment. Not only that, but each dish was a work of art in the craftsmanship it took to create the display. After dinner, we relaxed for some time in the lounge and were treated to a tour of the kitchen where we had the honor of meeting Chef O'Connell.

2024-05-27,rkny18,"Having eaten at other 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants, I’m not quite sure how the Inn has 3.  The food is good, but there were not multiple life changing dishes that we wanted to eat more of.  Maybe 1 or 2. Compared to Le Bernadin or L’Enclume, where we noted we’d come back for a big plate of nearly everything we ate, the Inn’s executions were enjoyable, but not particularly unique or memorable, with the exception of the lobster chartreuse.  The cheese course was excellent, but felt a bit rushed in its presentation, and was somewhat delayed in arrival. The cheese  server’s funny asides and puns were cute and clever, but they took away from time that could have been better spent seriously describing the cheeses. I suppose the jovial presentation is geared toward people who perhaps don’t really care to hear much about the varieties.  One cheese course detail I took great exception to was being served Carr’s Table Crackers with the cheese (along with some nice bread we’d already had during the meal). I mean, really? Carr’s? The same crackers I can buy at any grocery store? Served at a 3 star Michelin restaurant?  Embarrassing at best. Insulting at worst.  The bar experience both before and after dinner was a little odd.  We initially went to Patty O’s bar for a glass of pre-dinner champagne. While we were warmly greeted there, that was the beginning and end of the attention. The sole bartender didn’t look at or address us in any way. Meanwhile a gaggle of staff chatted away at the host’s station. After a few minutes of this inattention, we left for the Monkey Bar at the Inn across the street.  The Monkey Bar isn’t a proper bar with stools or chairs. It’s table service only, so any opportunity to chat with a bartender or a neighbor is mostly gone.  We were shown the ”bar”, but given no guidance as to where to sit. Oddly, we were asked if we were joining them for tea. They already knew we were there for dinner. Do a lot of dinner guests arrive early for tea? This spoke to a lack of communication.  We plopped down in 2 chairs l hoped weren’t reserved, and waited several minutes for any kind of recognition. Finally, someone came by to wipe down our table, which in my mind should have been done immediately after the previous guest left, not as we sat there watching.  A server came by to take a water order and chatted with us briefly about the whisky offerings. But after he left, he was replaced by s different server and we never interacted with him again.  This proved to be somewhat thematic throughout dinner. We were told we had one main server, and we did see her a few times, but it felt like each course was served by someone different, with varying levels of knowledge, polish, and enthusiasm.  One server kicked our table. Another bumped abruptly into my wife’s arm with no apology. So much for those ballet lessons Patrick paid for for the staff!  We asked for sparkling water. A random server brought it. I didn’t recognize the label so I enthusiastically asked “Oh, what’s that?”, pointing to the label. “Sparkling water” replied the server. lol come on. She eventually grasped that I was asking where it was from.  After the meal, we sensed they wanted the table back, so we decided to get after dinner drinks back at the bar.  Again, no actual bar, just some cushy chairs. It was comfortable, but my wife was a bit chilly from the AC blowing on her legs.  I asked our bar server if they had a throw she could use. He replied “Of course”, which has maddeningly become the de facto reply from the younger generation of servers today, to every request, regardless of the sincerity of the responder or the response.  No throw ever materialized. My wife remained chilly.  More chilly than the air however, were the drink prices.  $200 for a 1 ounce pour of an unusual but certainly not rare Islay Scotch, an entire bottle of which can be purchased for $250. $51 for a 1 ounce pour of basic Laphroaig 10 year. A bottle of that is $60 most places. Champagne by the glass prices were similarly silly.   I guess the alcohol prices were designed to keep people from lingering after the meal, and to make the $170 wine pairing seem like a bargain.   The wine pairing was fantastic I should add. And our sommelier, Nicole, was easily the most attentive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic server we encountered the entire evening. The perfect mix of personable and professional.  Had more of the staff been as great at what they do as Nicole is, I could see 3 Michelin stars. As it is, much of the staff seemed like college kids on summer break.  There is much talk of Mr. O’Connell expanding the Inn. Until he can shore up the service (and push the food envelope a bit) as it stands, I think he risks losing a star or two by becoming even larger. It’s clearly already a challenge for Mr. O’Connell to find experienced knowledgeable staff in the middle of the Virginia countryside. I don’t see how expanding his operation begets better service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r952664580-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,4,en
2024-05-19,mattva1,"What was supposed to be a fantastic evening, turned into a nightmare.   It started a few hours before our dinner when they called and asked me if I would move our reservation up an hour because they had some last-minute cancellations. I figured maybe they had some VIPs or something and wanted my slot. I didn’t really care so I agreed, but clearly explained that I wanted to have a drink before dinner in their bar area. She understood and agreed, saying that a lot of guests do that.  So I thought all was good. It wasn't.  I show up on time and am greeted with “your table is ready.” I asked to have ten minutes for a drink at the bar, but the receptionist wasn't having it. after explaining that we had discussed it when they asked to move my reservation up, she agreed but gave me a disgusted and snarky “fine, let us know when you are ready” sendoff.    So, I am left in a horrible confrontation situation which I didn’t ask for. But, now it is awkward, people think I’m being difficult, they are mad, etc. In any other situation I would have asked my wife if it was ok to leave and find another spot  – but they make you pre-pay a small fortune, it’s our anniversary, there is nowhere else to go in the town, and we drove hours to get there – so I was stuck, there was nothing I could do.   I’m so disappointed because all I wanted was a few minutes to enjoy a high-end, caringly made Manhattan before dinner. I'm sure it sounds small, but I was truly looking forward to it because I only drink on special occasions due to a health scare. Unfortunately for me, that moment was ruined. There was no way I could enjoy myself so I gave up, and couldn't get out of the bar to our table fast enough. But the whole negative vibe carried over into dinner – where I felt rushed and unsettled. My wife knew I was upset and did her best. But, the entire dinner, meal, experience sucked. I hated every minute of it.   I’m sure everyone else will rave about the place. And I get it, having been there half-dozen times for dinners, fundraisers, special occasions - so I do appreciate it. But, that is gone.   No way should this have happened – especially at a place where it costs $1,200 for dinner for two.   As far as the food went, it could have been the best meal in the world and it wouldn’t have mattered to me under the circumstances. But, it wasn’t even particularly good. They killed the shrimp and duck with dill. Except for some egg thing (which was great) the rest was just ok.   While I’m at it, one thing that surprised me was that the mens room was a bit gross. I expect that at an airport or some public place. But, not at a restaurant like this. In all fairness, it’s not entirely their fault if someone can’t hit the urinal, and I noticed someone was heading that way to clean things up. But, it’s a bad look for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r951439652-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,1,en

2024-02-09,UE_DC64,"We stayed one night at the Inn and enjoyed the afternoon tea, the dinner, and the breakfast. What stood out to me was how pampered I felt. There were more staff taking care of us than there were customers. The lodging was super cute and had everything one could wish for, and with small, nice gifts in several rounds. Of course, it wasn't cheap.   The dinner was exquisite but with a few things that could have been better. I loved everything I ate, and the dishes were nicely (and sometimes innovatively) presented. But, while the menu left my wife full, I finished the meal feeling I had room for more. And I am not super huge or anything. We seem to have been unlucky with the bread service. We didn't get any bread (other tables did) and when I asked if we could also get some bread, the response was ""Yes, I can get you some bread"", as if I were asking for a side order, rather than a response like ""Oh, sorry, we missed you, we will get you bread right away"". And I had to do it again for a second piece of bread. This is  very unusual for any good restaurant. Perhaps I was unlucky.  I was also a little disappointed with the breakfast. We got a very nice parfait of sort and then a basket with different types of mostly sweet stuff. Anything else, like an omelet or such would cost an extra $25--rather outrageous in my view. I had expected a nice buffet with lots of different types of bread, cheeses, yogurts, etc., as I would get in any hight star hotel.  All in all, we had a great stay here and enjoyed the pampering and the excellent food, but I few things did not live up to my expectations (for the price we paid)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r937588024-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,4,en

2023-09-23,sarah w,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  If you are complaining about the cost, then this is not a culinary experience for you.  If you are complaining about the portions, then I do not know what to say, but I was more than full and I did not consume everything they offered to me.   My boyfriend and I booked the kitchen table for a birthday celebration.   We were immediately greeted and ushered to the living room of the Inn where we enjoyed some cocktails before dinner.  Then we were greeted by one of the hosts and ushered into the kitchen itself for dinner after being told that we had our table for the entire evening and should not feel rushed, but encourage to tarry and enjoy.    When we entered the kitchen there was an enjoyable exhibition of pomp and circumstance as we were personally greeted by Chef Patrick O'Connell by name and his brilliant smile.  Our table was spacious and the seating comfortable.  Immediately the attentive staff began to serve and accommodate us.  Everyone was gracious and enjoyable.  We had water immediately and personalized menus in hand as we were guided through the selections and choices before us.  With those made, we began an incredible experience for any passionate foodie.    Everything from the house made bread and butter to the parmesan truffle popcorn was not only delicious, but available for unlimited refills.  Restraint was necessary to avoid being overly full long before the end of the meal.  We chose to get everything on the gastronaut's menu between the two of us, including the $62.00 upcharge for the caviar dish.  We had ten courses, including a hand delivered first dessert course by Patrick in honor of the birthday.  Every course and thus every dish was exceptional in taste and presentation.  They then sent us home with a bespoke box of confections.  We got more than I expected.    We also chose to do the wine pairing, and with that additional charge, I can say that one should expect to spend several thousand dollars for an all in dining experience in the chef's kitchen.  What you pay for is an experience and an encounter with not just the 3 Star Michelin Chef himself, but his staff and to witness first hand the amazing fluidity of the kitchen staff.  While I have never eaten in the dining room, I can say that I would without hesitation come back and dine there.  This was a once in a lifetime experience to mark a special occasion for us, so the expense was well worth it to us,  but if you are concerned about the fiscal bottom line or portion size, then this might now be the culinary experience for you.  For us, it was one to remember forever.  ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r918000859-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,5,en

The only issue we had was that during our arrival the person at the front desk ask for prove of the reservation. I did not have cell signal and could not show her. She made me and my wife very uncomfortable. I would expect that an hotel that is so highly regarded would have better service at their reception. After I gave her my Id and told her to check she found my reservation. She should have asked for an ID before she asked for proof of reservation. If you are white they probably won't have any issues finding your reservation.  Overall, after this small incident, everything was perfect and the stay was memorable.

2023-08-13,Raksmie H,"I’m giving this restaurant a 2-stars — I’ve dined at over 15 Michelin star restaurants all over the world and 3 of the 15 were 3-stars so I’d like to think that I’m pretty experienced.  I really wanted to walk into this experience loving it but it was average, over priced, and underwhelming (just like I stated in my title).   Staff: Very friendly and super nice, they greeted us at the door and walked us to our table (as expected).  The service at the table was a miss for me, they left crumbs on our table from the bread and it was never cleaned up, usually you’ll have people who come around and clean your crumbs. There wasn’t a stool or a basket where you can put your purse or belongings in, usually they have that at the the table. The sommelier wasn’t certified but he was the sweetest kid! I could tell he was still in training due to his lack of knowledge of pairing the wine with the food, and I also learned that he tried deconstructed dishes that are usually left overs to help him pair the wine which I find very interesting because if you want consistency  throughout the experience, every sommelier should be treated the same. I understand that he’s in training but why wouldn’t you have a certified sommelier around to assist him. The condensation from the wine dripped over my fiancé bread as it was being poured, I’m used a clean bottle. Overall the staff was nice and knowledgeable.   Food: The food was so good but it wasn’t great. We picked the Gastronomy menu with the wine pairing. I found it odd that with the menu you still had to pick this or that, I’m used to enjoying everything on the menu as is but if we still need to pick between appetizers, main course, and dessert let’s not call it a tasting menu. The food was cooked and well prepared but the plating was boring and subpar, there was no theme to the menu it was just food on a white plate.  None of the dishes wowed me it was just good. The wine paired well with the food but we didn’t get the background of what notes to taste for or look forward to, I didn’t enjoy the 4 empty glasses placed on the table for future wine to come, it over crowded our table and it made it a little complicating for our server to serve us food as things had to be moved around — not the type of service you would expect from a 3-star.   Parking: Plenty of parking and valet available. Ambiance: Beautiful seating area and nice colonial feel.  Vegetarian and’s vegan options available.  Overall Summary: In short, you don’t get what you pay for. I suggest you save up the $2K you’re about to spend on this experience and purchase a plane ticket overseas and pay for a 3-star in Spain or France.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910037648-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,2,en
2023-08-13,Kendall K,"This restaurant is good but overhyped. I think Michelin gives this one a “pass” due to the uniqueness of its location, the history and frankly it needs to be re-rated because it does not meet the standard of a Michelin 3 star like Aponiente in Spain. I had high expectations due to how everyone in the town speaks so highly of this place. It honestly feels a little weird because it’s as if everyone is afraid to speak truthfully on the restaurant out of fear they’ll disappear like in a horror movie, kind of cultish vibes. If this is your first Michelin I get why you’d love this place but they have some work to do.   Anyway, out of all of the Michelin restaurants I’ve been to, the service, the presentation and the food all was top notch and was like a dance. The Inn at Little Washington seemed like they were resting on the fact that they were a top rated restaurant and didn’t need to work as hard. For a restaurant that I spent nearly $1,600 for I expected a lot.   I didn’t like that I had to pick between menus. Since I paid for a tasting menu with a wine pairing I expected the restaurant to provide several courses that would fill me up and I was not anywhere near full at the conclusion of dinner. The plating and presentation of the food was boring, there was no style or awe factor in how the food was presented. Most places will try to match the cuisine to a creative plate. It was pretty underwhelming. The Michelin company rated The Inn to have a gastronomy star yet the restaurant didn’t explain what specifically about their menu was gastronomy like others that I’ve been too.   The sommelier we had wasn’t certified and didn’t have his grape pin. Typically Michelin restaurants who have a sommelier in training will have an actual sommelier with them throughout the dining experience. With our wine pairing they placed several empty glasses on the table which I had never seen before and didn’t fill them, typically your wine glasses aren’t just sitting on the table taking up space from your plates. Generally each glass is brought to you for each course. They didn’t take the time to wipe off the bottles after they pulled it from the wine cooler, as the sommelier in training poured, there was lots of ice water from the bottle dripping on our table and food.   The waiters didn’t remove bread crumbs from our table, didn’t fold our napkins when we went to the restroom, didn’t have a stool or basket for us to put our belongings in at our table. Nothing during the fine dining screamed three star restaurant, I think Michelin needs to re-evaluate this, I believe this place is a ONE star at best. Overseas Michelin’s seem to have to go through a higher grading criteria because I’ve seen way better places that are underrated that could be two or three stars and the Inn is somehow rated higher with not nearly as good of service.   Typically if the chef is not on travel they will come out and greet their guest and Mr. O’Connell didn’t seem to have the time I presume to stop by tables to simply say hello. I truly expected more but you know what they say about high expectations leading to high disappointment. It’s just not worth the money spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58290-d497947-r910031634-Inn_at_Little_Washington-Washington_Rappahannock_County_Virginia.html,3,en
2023-08-13,SVWOnline,"Not our first visit, but certainly our least enjoyable.  Our only expectation was that the experience would justify the $2800 we paid for a party of 4. I feel strongly that objectively it missed the mark. I will repeat what others reviewers have already stated. My very first cocktail was incorrect. The food service timing was oddly off. A table close to us was seated after we were and was on their 3rd course before our appetizers arrived. The bread service was inconsistent and as many have pointed out the breadcrumbs on our table were only removed prior to our desert. Quarters were cramped, forcing servers to reach over the table. Multiple times during the meal objects were dropped close by startling all of us. Overall the service was good but not delivered with ease and the engagements felt rehearsed. The star of the evening was our sommelier. Her knowledge and explanations of our wine pairings were both insightful and entertaining. At the end of our meal we were not offered after dinner drinks or coffee/tea service. We end up retiring to the bar area for drinks, where the disappointment continued and we waited 15 minutes for someone to recognize we were done so we could pay our check. I ended up paying cash for the drinks so we could leave without any further hurdles.

2023-07-16,jbrown2665," This is now the second time we have been to Delta and both experiences have been outstanding.    Last summer, we visited the restaurant shortly after they first opened and before their Michelin two-star rating, but even then, you could easily understand that they were destined for greatness.    When we went back last week, it was nice to see that the staff remembered us from almost exactly a year ago.  While there was one similar dish from the year before, every new addition to their repertoire was surprising, flawlessly presented and perfectly executed.  Another reviewer said it perfectly that “this is not only a restaurant; it’s a full experience” and it is an experience that should not be missed if you can manage it.   Well done, “Delta”.

The commitment to sustainability is beyond admirable, and the presentation of each course is truly phenomenal and without equal.  At the end of the evening, however, I felt that maybe the taste of the food was at times secondary to its appearance.  I am not trying to be overly critical, as most of the courses were excellent, but the ""early spring insect of lobster"" in the form of a bumblebee and the ""edible butterfly"" of chilled aerated beeswax cream and other ingredients are examples of too much focus on presentation and not enough on taste.

It’s definitely different from a lot of other starred restaurants in the sense that each dish of the 12-courses menu has a history in itself and it goes way beyond the simple tasting experience. It’s just pure magic! We enjoyed everything, from the appetizers to the dessert. What can be improved though is the service: in a 2-stars restaurant you expect definitely more attention to the guest (from the type of water You drink to the kindness of waiters)…definitely what you do not expect is having a waitress telling you that you cannot go to the restroom if then the next course comes 15 minutes later!… But again, the food is worth the whole experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r900027982-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,5,en

Extremely average desserts after a disappointing meal..   Fine crockery, great service as expected and possibly the only thing they have worked on..

2023-04-09,riva_e_o,"after visiting Geranium we were really excited to try delta - as one of the chefs was assistant Head Chef there. the restaurant design was amazing - we were seated in front the window that overlooked the marine. the service was attentive and the dishes were unique in flavor.   so why the bad review? i belive that a 2 star MICHELIN  restaurant isn't just about good food but also the 360° experience - something phenomenal  that goes with you days later - this restaurant disappointed in that aspect.  as i do not eat pork i was served Turbot kissed by the fire and served with a sauce of seasonal offerings and my companions got the Pluma iberico seasoned . after 20 mins i told my husband that i have Heartburn. 10 min later i started to fell nausea and blamed it on fatigue and asked for tea. after 50 min from eating the  Turbot  i was trying not to throw up in the restaurant. came back to the hotel and as i laughingly said to my husband the next morning - ""i throw away 200 EURO to the toilet"".  it was a horrible night.    for concern to other guests and for the name of the restaurant i sent them  an email stating that i was not writing for a refund just for there knowledge as i was the only one that was so sick.   no email. no phone call - no nothing from them. not even how I'm feeling. waited a week an wrote this review.   so if you want to go to a restaurant that looks at you as as walking EURO and not as customer or a guest - enjoy.  i didn't.

2023-04-01,saikumardxb1972,I am delighted to express my experience with the Delta restaurant dining  experience. Being a refined hospitality professional with a culinary experience of over 20 years dining at top restaurants in this planet I can only say that it is a WOW.   The culinary journey was sensational and their focus and vision behind the journey is speechless. Each dish was unique and extraordinary and we had a premium wine pairing which is a perfect match for this exceptional gastronomy.  Service is outstanding and very personalised and ambience is very modern and elegant.  Overall my experience is a WOW.

2023-03-30,Nico,"I discovered that after reservation, the restaurant silently increased tasting menu price from 170 to 200 EUR.  The setting is stunning. A lot of space, high ceilings, trees floating in the air, an excellent view. The music, as in most reataurants, was (slightly) too loud, so that I didn‘t understand everything our waiter explained to us. Service was excellent in the beginning. The food was interesting and tasty, but the initial courses were too small. One course was literally just one little mushroom.  In the end, they dropped the ball completely. After the last course was served, they just forgot us. We had to ask multiple times for the bill. When we left, nobody said goodbye or even looked at us. Yes, the restaurant was full. But I simply expect more from a 2-star Michelin restaurant. For what we paid, I was disappointed. Price/value ratio is not good here. It also didn‘t help that there was a baby that made noise druing the whole evening. A restaurant like this should outright forbid the presence of small children.  Overall, disappointed not just with this restaurant, but with Michelin as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r884157586-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,3,en

2022-11-03,zvoomb,"We went to this aesthetically superb space in a building designed by Renzo Piano with great expectations, but we left somehow disappointed. Our experience from other 2-Michelin-stars restaurants made us hope for a memorable evening, yet tastewise there was something not right. Although visually the dishes—also the tableware—were stunning, they let us down. Many of them were often unfamiliarly sweet — we didn’t like, for instance, lobster with lotus fruit. There was seafood with strawberries and fish with prunes; are we traditionalists? Maybe. Yet we enjoy enormously Asian or fusion food. The menu was unbalanced: a long series of dishes based on seafood and fish, then suddenly only one with meat (Iberico) and then all of a sudden three deserts together. The wine served was also disappointing, there were some biodynamic wines who are not to everybody’s liking, although the pairing was good. Also, wine pairing started after the hors d’œuvres which means that one has to take an aperitif (we did), otherwise there is nothing there. The team that served us was impeccable, very professional and at the same time not pretentious and friendly. Our sommelier was a pleasure to listen to. One last thing: for my partner who hates fingerfood, there was a problem; a large part of the menu is to be eaten with the fingers. This restaurant has the potential to become better; we all know that Michelin stars are not everything, especially if other factors, such as service and aesthetics, contribute to their attribution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r867104434-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,4,en

2022-07-03,jbrown2665,"Friends suggested we visit “Delta” and although I was resistant, simply because I can be a picky eater, I must say that the dinner was outstanding, and the entire experience was absolutely perfect.   Although we had been to the Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center a few times in the past and have always loved it, this time was very different because we capped off the visit with an incredible, 13 course meal from two world class chefs and a staff that was equally trained to ensure that their guests left completely satisfied and with huge smiles.   Athens certainly has several world restaurants, some with Michelin stars, but this is without a doubt, my favorite. Delta is unique for sure. Each dish was a wonderful surprise of flavors, presentation, artistry, and they all perfectly test and satisfy your senses.   I could describe the dishes we had, but I believe that would destroy the experience of going because not knowing in advance and allowing these master chefs to surprise you with every plate is all part its intrigue.   Special thanks to the team that made our meal absolutely memorable in the very best of ways and for being able to keep a restless person like me not just engaged, but actually wanting more after each turn along their wonderful culinary journey.   One piece of advice though is to book the 17-course option instead of the 13 we had. We knew instantly, that the 13 course was a mistake and that we would be wanting and in fact, needing more. Because the restaurant is conscious of waste and sustainability, upgrading to the 17-course meal during your visit is impossible. However, we now know, and we will most certainly return and do it even better the next time around.   BRAVO, DELTA!!  We will see you again and we will definitely recommend you to everyone as you most certainly earned that and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189467-d18820451-r846098811-Delta-Kallithea_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,5,en

2019-05-22,Alan F,"One of Michelin's few picks in town and a wise one. The ambiance is pleasing, the welcome is cordial, and most importantly, the cooking is to a high standard. Of course, with one meal you can't fully assess a restaurant's strengths and weaknesses. Our fish (Saint Pierre) was beautifully cooked in a Staub pot along with a fine array of vegetables. Simple, but the flavors matched perfectly.  A chocolate dish was also straightforward, but of high quality. As restaurants adapt to people drinking less, I wish they would offer a larger array of half bottles. A decent Chablis was one of the very few choices of a suitable white wine.

2018-08-31,Anne S,"My partner and I stayed at the nearby Hotel de Clisson in the same quiet side street just off the town centre. We dined here the first night of our holiday and enjoyed our meal so much that we returned later in the week.  We were given a friendly welcome both evenings. The restaurant which is fairly small but has an upper floor, was busy so we were fortunate to have booked a table. It seemed to be popular with locals - always a good sign and we didn’t hear any other English speaking diners. We speak some French although English is understood by the staff.  The 17.90 Euro three course menu is good value with plenty of choice. The restaurant specialises in casseroles served in a cast iron pot (‘cocotte’) for both fish and meat dishes, served with vegetables in a bouillon. This is left on the table and you help yourself. An ‘amuse-bouche’ (no charge) is served whilst you are choosing from the menu or with an aperitif. On our second visit it included olives and crispy radish. As a starter I particularly enjoyed the home-made gazpacho especially the delicious and inventive beetroot and raspberry vinegar version. The desserts included a tasty apricot panna cotta on our second visit. The only disappointment was my partner’s cheese plateau which only had a selection of two small strips of cheese with a heap of lettuce!

The dishes at LATURE ranged from overly bland to excessively strong in taste, lacking the balance and finesse one would expect from a highly regarded establishment. It was disappointing that the kitchen seemed indifferent to how diners felt about their dishes. Whether it was a matter of personal preference or a genuine issue with the execution, the lack of attentiveness to customer satisfaction was disheartening.  While it's true that taste preferences vary, it's essential for a restaurant of this caliber to prioritize customer feedback and adapt accordingly. It's regrettable that this level of attention to detail was not evident during my visit.  Given the reputation and accolades, I had hoped for a more exceptional culinary experience.

Presentation was delightful in its creativity (eating out of a book?!) and the portions were extremely generous, which I have found to be rare among French restaurants in Tokyo.

2024-02-29,YacchanAmarone,"I had lunch with a colleague on a weekday.  It was a 6,400 yen (tax included) lunch course.  The dishes we had were as follows.  ◯Amuse-bouche: Macaroons made with deer blood  →These macaroons are made with the blood that is drained from the venison that is served as the main course. They had a faint taste of venison in their sweetness. I was a little shocked when I heard the description of the dish, but it was delicious.  ◯Jerusalem artichoke potage  →It was delicious, with a good balance of butter and cream.  ◯Appetizer: A dish made with scallops, Japanese pepper, cacao, etc.  →The presentation was very good. However, I wasn't sure if the flavors of the multiple ingredients were well-married.  ◯Game terrine  →A dish of bear, badger, deer, and wild boar game meat arranged in layers with foie gras. It was a unique dish. I don't often have the opportunity to eat bear, so I was interested in the taste of bear. However, the most delicious part was when the venison and foie gras were arranged next to each other.  ◯Main: Venison →The meat was so juicy that you wouldn't believe it was venison. The red wine sauce was also delicious.  ◯Dessert: Kochi pomace and meringue →The ginger flavor was good.  I was impressed with the concept of ""expressing gratitude to the animals whose lives were taken"" by using up all the venison's blood. I was grateful that they were able to provide such delicious food for just 6,000 yen. Thanks to the chef too.

2023-05-19,William-de-Windsor,As you can read in several reviews further down:  Thierry Schwartz’s cuisine is on one hand quite innovative with local products but the taste experience is unfortunately limited.  Another aspects should not be underestimated: Approximately 90% of the wine list are “natural wines”. For those who do not like this style of wine which is very different to delicate wines (based on wine making processes developed over centuries!) this is another big disappointment. Bio dynamic wine making doesn’t mean automatically fantastic wine taste (unfortunately!). This new „movement“ is anyhow a big miracle…  Gimmicks like making fresh butter at the table are gratuitous! - We ate already many delicate cremes in several Michelin Star restaurants and not everybody loves simple butter.  The service is definitely very kind and attentive!  Summary:  Why got Thierry Schwartz „1 Michelin star“? Definitely the worst „Michelin star restaurant“ experience so far - and we tested this level up to 3 stars all over the world 😉. Not value for money and a disappointing experience 😢 which we didn’t have very often fortunately 😃,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r890962701-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html,3,en

2022-04-30,ZelenEye,"Possibly the biggest disappointment for a Michelin star restaurant ever.  Five course menu (124€) was: (1) a green salad, some unfresh leaves; (2) one spear of asparagus (very nice); (3) a small piece of farmed char (floury consistency); (4) a little bit of white and brown chicken meat (dry); (5) one piece of rhubarb (not fully cooked). This is no exaggeration.  The ambiance is very nice. The service was lovely and theatrical, if not perfect. They bake your bread and churn your butter. Very nice people. The wine list is outstanding. The products are no doubt good.

I don't know the cost as it was included in our tour, but whatever it was, it was worth it. The focus is on local, seasonal food cooked to perfection in thoughtful and different ways.   Of great note were the strawberries soaked in balsamic for a year and then halved and served as an appetiser.  A signature dish was the egg ravioli entree. The main course was beef which was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth; the asparagus flowerhead were unusual accompaniment; bread was freshly cooked and brought to the table still warm.

2017-05-26,Alan L,"Visited for lunch today.  We were excited as it is a one star Michelin rated restaurant.  Our first mistake was not realizing the restaurant considers the Friday after Ascension to also be a holiday, calling it a Holiday weekend, even though most stores and businesses treated it as a normal weekday and even the Post Office was open.  By calling it a Holiday they didn't offer the €45 lunch menu and the 3 course menu was instead €75.  While this was annoying, it wasn't enough for us to leave.   The restaurant is in an old home and the interior was beautiful, inviting, and warm.  We both had apertifs, Picon for me and Cremánt for my wife.  For dinner I had a glass of Riesling and my wife had a Pinot Noir, both were very good. The complimentary appetizer was an asparagus reduction with the consistency of jelly and it was virtually tasteless.  We were also given brioche, which was quite good. The bread that they made for us at the hearth after showing us the dough, was burned. This didn't deter the waiter from cutting and proudly serving it to us.  My wife had a mixed local vegetable appetizer that was delicious, but unfortunately, my crab ravioli soup appetizer was very fishy tasting,  My wife's main course was essentially a boneless short rib.  Good but not great.  The hunting knife she was given was dull and the knife I was given for my fish was much better for cutting her meat.  My main course was fish with local baby vegetables and it was very good.  As a 3rd course,  my wife ordered a whipped egg white dessert with nuts and chocolate sauce.  No complaints.  My third course was an interesting and tasty combination of a caramelized sugar base, with whipped potato layer, then topped with shredded Comte cheese.  We thought the waiter asked us if my wife wanted her dessert at the same time as my cheese, but apparently he asked if she also wanted the cheese dish as they brought her one as well.  We thought they were being considerate by splitting my portion into two dishes, but that wasn't the case and we were charged an additional €18 for this dish.  My issue here is that we had each ordered the 3 course menu, so why ask us  2/3 of the way into our meal if we wanted a fourth course? We accepted responsibility for the misunderstanding and paid the bill without complaint.  All in all, the meal was good, but certainly not great, and not to what we've come to expect from a 1 star establishment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g196497-d15014147-r488003773-Thierry_Schwartz_Le_Restaurant-Obernai_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html,3,en

Although the juices it had been marinated in were tasty the quality of the meat was awful.  It was completely rare, but still amazingly tough.  The bread although baked once we had sat at the table and obviously totally fresh was tastless.  The concept of the dinning experience is freshness and the decor is lovely.  The freshness part is superb, but they just don't have equally high quality food.  The desert was strawberries on top of a cream with cheese mix, tasty but nothing extraordinary at all.

I cannot say enough about this epicurean gem. As we entered the restaurant, we were met with a warm amber glow - so welcoming after the cold, bitter air of the December night.  The atmosphere / ambiance is charming - the natural wooden beams give the restaurant an inviting warmth but it is certainly not your grandmother's house:) -- the decor and tableware are somewhat eclectic and unique...definitely more trendy than traditional. The staff is extremely efficient and hospitable, and we felt relaxed and welcome from the moment we entered.  But more than that, the food was delicious and creative.  The chef/owner definitely seems to take pride in creating food that delights his customers. Every course was a treat (the homemade bread is more than delicious!!) and the wine selected by our waitress (we chose not to do a wine pairing) was perfect. The chef/owner, besides being an artist with food, was also extremely hospitable -- coordinating with a local taxi service to return us to our hotel in Strasbourg after dinner.

However, the systematic search for multi-flavoured pairings often undermines the intrinsic taste of the excellent products used: for example, beef ripened on the oyster disappears completely under horseradish cream and langoustine in gravlax is drowned in lemon olive oil. Knives, turbot and lamb, very well worked, are certainly excellent but the quantity served for the last two is simply ridiculous (it must be 2 or 3 tens of grams at most). Finally, some combinations are perplexing such as artichoke with lamb or peas with red fruits...

2024-04-21,timwitvoet,"Beautiful location, beautiful room surrounded by greenery, although it was still quite cold there when we entered. There is no lack of luxury and surroundings, in that respect it is certainly worth 2*, but the level does not exceed that of 1*. On the other hand, even a few mistakes that you should not encounter at that level. Both hot starters were served too cold. With the dish with Lotte, the plate was not even preheated at all, so the plate arrives lukewarm and it is actually as good as cold at the last bite... a bit disappointing that we choose 7 courses and the amuses are actually the 1st course are. We are used to something different in Belgium, maybe that still happens in France? However, this was not the case in our previous experience in France. The starter with langoustine was beautiful, beautiful and pure, but across the board the menu struggles to live up to the 16/20 from G&M (which is already a close score to achieve 2*). The main course was rabbit roulade. The garnishes were very nice but the roulade was dry and only survived with the addition of sufficient sauce, a pity...but a nice choice of cheese, both desserts were ok and above all beautifully presented. Mignardises/coffee/dessert very extensive. It was a beautiful afternoon but the kitchen should do better to charge €240 excl. drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g673651-d23817731-r947689913-Le_Restaurant_Gastronomique_Christophe_Dufosse-Busnes_Pas_de_Calais_Hauts_de_Fr.html,3,en

2023-08-28,Jer_vht,"Christophe Dufossé is a chef full of energy with serious motivation to strive for excellence. Obtaining the second star is proof of this.  The transition from the Meurin era has been successful, the Château de Beaulieu is resplendent. The restaurant room is very charming, but remains quite noisy with imperfect soundproofing which creates echoes. You have to speak loudly to understand each other!  The staff is completely up to the standard of the place and the cuisine. Young, dynamic, smiling and professional. We had good times of discussion, including with the Chef who visited all the tables.  We ate very well. The dressing is impeccable, the ingredients are quality. We really liked the pigeon, which was cooked perfectly. However, we didn't have a favorite dish, it was missing that little je ne sais quoi to create a particular emotion.  The responsible approach is appreciable, the establishment makes a lot of effort to source locally.  Big downside for us who are wine lovers: the prices! I had very good memories of the previous owner and his love for the divine nectars that accompany beautiful French cuisine. Many bottles here reached stratospheric prices, something I had never seen in a two Michelin star. The majority of bottles are completely inaccessible. It is understandable that the renovation work was expensive, but it is unfair to blame everything on our fine French grapes. This really took away some of the fun, unfortunately.

In took a very long time for that to arrive (more than an hour), the cooks seem overly relaxed (the kitchen is open). Apparently the idea is to offer a long and tranquil evening but we were hungry. A bit faster would be good. Anyway the rest went faster (white fish and tomato risotto, fish was 'acceptable', risotto excellent).

2024-10-13,Yann R,"The new generation of chefs is able to serve up a midday menu with vegetables in the lead role. Yes there was a delicious dish of crayfish and also one with dry aged entrecote from the grill.  Still, the vegetable dishes stole the show. It started with preparations of red cabbage. A nice change of pickled, sorbet, powder and a rye cookie. The roasted beetroot in the fritter was so flavorful. Again different preparations of the same product but because of the difference in sweet, sour and bite this is a top dish. The visual presentation is very strong. And I never knew you could eat dahlia petals.  The sommelier takes the wishes and taste pattern of me very well into account because I have indicated to be by car and want max 2 glasses during dinner. He asks well and therefore I am served a perfect white and red. What I also like about them is that they use local herbs, vegetables and flowers.  I ate some new ingredients (for me) like spirea and watermint. Very nice and a promise for a better sustainable future.

When I did do the reservation, they only had one star and I was not aware about the recent development. So I did struggle all the evening to understand how blind the Michelin testers could have been to not leave two or even three stars for this restaurant. Just when I got the bill which had the two stars and the green one imprinted. I could do justice to the Michelin testers… And I really think there is potential for a third star. We have been to the only two 3* restaurants in Norway just one respectively seven days before, so we could well compare. And we would rate the Kontrast in between. To be precise we would place it ahead of Maaemo.   The only thing they need to work on is the acoustic at their place . it’s rather loud, which makes it difficult to understand the explanations about the dishes and drinks. Maybe some noise cancelling on the ceiling and some noise cancelling sculptures could help  But overall, I truly fully recommend this place  and think the team for a perfect evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r964224959-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2023-09-23,Michael U,"Born in Skåne Mikael Svensson began his career in Oslo before stints with 3* Spaniards Quique Dacosta and Martin Berasategui, a focus on ""organic and ethically sourced Ingredients from within Norway"" seeing Restaurant Kontrast show off local producers and the Animals they raise.   Stating “the end result is never better than the quality of the Product you start with,” a fact frequently overlooked in today’s low-cost and convenience driven market, it is through temperatures and textures frequently found in juxtaposition that Svensson builds layered bites tied together through the use of acid, fermentation and Herbs.  A fifteen-course tasting that begins in the lounge, cement floors and exposed ceilings creating an industrial feel that magnifies noise from other tables, opening bites consist of bold flavors such as Scallops with bitter Vegetables and Shrimp with Horseradish before moving on to a delicate Donut followed by a Pork Blood Croustade topped in Vinegar-splashed Cheese.  Going down the street for a Sunchoke and Tim Wendelboe Coffee before taking a seat in front of the open kitchen, just five Chefs running three seatings simultaneously, a vibrant White Wine from Hungary proved adept to handling first Turnips and Sea Snails with Caviar then poignant Crab Curry imbued with Garum atop Carrots and Sour Cream.  Refusing to outsource Sauces, Mikael’s XO a three-year process made on-site, Crucifers spung to life before Wild Halibut and Chicken with Mushrooms, Soy and a complex reduction featuring Yellow Wine with Sweet Corn.  Slowing as the room filled up, lengthy waits between courses seeing the final four items take longer than the first eight, aged Lamb brought plenty of flavor to match Cherries plus Coffee before frozen Kraftkar Bleu Cheese and Sunflower Seed Ice Cream shocked the palate in preparation for elegantly arranged Plums followed by Mignardises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r918050054-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en

2022-08-02,midway42,"Michael Svensson is a Swedish chef that followed the long, arduous road to his current location that many creators/proprietors have travelled before and will in the future.  Born and raised in Sweden, he attended culinary school in Kristiansand and then spent an internship at Le Canard in Oslo.  After traveling in Europe and working at several Michelin restaurants to continue his education, he returned to Oslo and eventually opened Kontrast (without any investors!) in 2013.  The restaurant is at its second location in a sparse, industrial-like space (Vulkan) and received its first star in 2016.  It has retained that distinction ever since.  I was met at the front desk, my reservation confirmed, and immediately brought to a couch by the kitchen.  I ordered an aperitif (“Lost in Oslo”… named because if you have more than one you will reflect the title) and four nibbles followed: razor clams, grilled tomato, mackerel with cucumber/wasabi, and a fantastic pork blood “croustade” with Holtefjell XO cheese.  An eight-course meal ensued at my table in the dining room with a wine pairing.  This was very well done and followed the classic “lighter fare to heavier fare and then dessert” concept that is universal at these places largely because it makes sense.  Highlights included grilled wild halibut (with zucchini and pesto) and pork belly (with cabbage, black apple, and bread miso sauce).  Service was flawless, with the maitre'd Sylvester being equally considerate, professional, knowledgable, and attentive.  I made the comment several times during the meal that “a one-star in Europe equals two in the US,” and the more I think about it a more honest and less offensive way of saying this is “this restaurant clearly is in two-star territory.”  I’ve eaten at over eighty Michelin restaurants on four continents and had bumps-in-the-road on all of them;  Kontrast clearly is a highlight.  The fact that they focus on sustainable food and smaller purveyors only made a great experience better.  This was an overall fantastic meal and one I would consistently return to if I lived in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r851488299-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2021-10-11,PaulMG4,"Either we dined on an unlucky night, or the chef needs to review quite a few of the dishes. I have rarely experienced this lack of equilibrium in dishes: for instance the scallop, a sweet and delicate affair on its own, was absolutely butchered by one of the overly acidic sauce. Choosing to serve frozen blue cheese (and a lot of it) as a pre-dessert is also a significant faux-pas. I generally agree with Michelin ratings, but I am failing to see the flair and ability here.  The service was good at the beginning, but the pace of the dishes was awfully slow and I feel that the waiters got tired and bored as the night progresses. To the point that we barely got a 'thanks' after paying. The last hour of service was probably the worst I have ever experienced in a similar establishment. I only save the french sommelier as she was efficient and nice throughout the entire service, the only true professional in my opinion.  And at around 200 euros per person, I would completely avoid the place if you know your fine dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r813996325-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,2,en

We strongly recommend it if you’re visiting Oslo and you want to celebrate something special :)   The prices of the food menu are reasonable comparing to any other restaurant in Oslo with normal food…the prices only double those, but Kontrast quality is much better than double :) (just to say something, the drinks prices are quite high, as in every Michelin restaurant)  The place is super nice, you feel really comfortable and the service is excellent! As they notice that we were Spanish they told an Spanish waiter to come to our table and explain all the dishes to us :)  WE LOVED IT!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r806812619-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en
2021-07-30,KnutMarius,"Delightful in every aspect. Fantastic service, pleasant ambience, and of course an impeccable meal. Set aside the entire evening, and don’t make any plans for the following morning.  Me and my partner went to Kontrast on a Thursday evening. We weren’t celebrating anything, but perhaps we should have; one is so well taken care of that a visit there feels like a reward or a gift.  From the very start one is met with professionalism and great service. We were greeted at the door by a smiling and welcoming head waitress which set the bar for the whole evening. The premises were sparsely decorated, but well-kept and most importantly - clean. Even though we sat in a relatively small room with approx. 15 tables, it didn’t feel crowded. The acoustics were spot-on, making the experience intimate as one is not disturbed by noise from the room. We had no problem conversing at a casual volume, which is remarkable considering the fact that the guests dine in the same room as the kitchen where the chefs are at full work. They even managed to place a little lounge area between the dining area and the entrance without it feeling stuffed or out of place. This restaurant is a case in point to the importance of architecture and interior design.  The food was, as expected, flawless. Everything from the combination of flavors to the presentation of the dishes to the construction of the menu to the variety of ingredients used was spot on. The attention to detail dedicated to the arrangement on the plate was immaculate, the work of true artists. The highlights of the evening were the strawberry dessert with sunflower seed butter (a match made in heaven with the salt and sweet), the kale and cauliflower dish (the kale was cooked to perfection) as well as the halibut with rucola sauce (the intense taste of chlorophyl from the sauce went like a charm with the fish).  There were some exciting surprises during the meal - duck breast cured in coffee (delicious), poached oyster covered in sour cream, and crab marinated in aquavit. For the most part, however, the combination of flavors was conventional - seafood and cucumber, strawberries and cream, veal and mushroom. Which is not to say that it is a bad thing. Their craftmanship is uncontested, but their experimentation with flavors and preparation techniques wasn’t cutting edge. The freeze-and-crumble technique that was used on the blue cheese, for example, was neat but it’s getting a bit old.  We ordered, as we always do, one juice pairing and one wine pairing. The juice pairing was a gift that kept on giving, with each new glass more delicious than the last. Many of the juices consisted of different varieties of tea, and I firmly believe that some had the potential of being sold as soft drinks in their own right. Anyone dining at Kontrast simply must try the juice pairing.  Some food for thought did enter my mind as we progressed through the meal. No menu was provided for the evening. During the presentation of each dish it was at times hard to catch everything of what was being said, as well as remember it afterwards. Without the menu, we weren’t able to go back or double-check the ingredients of each dish. As we discuss every aspect of these kinds of meals vigorously, we both would have appreciated information about the menu in writing in order to refer to it later.  I would have skipped one dish. We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal and one dish in particular seemed, in hindsight, unnecessary. It was a squid dish, consisting mainly of pasta. With the overweight of seafood in the meal, the squid dish being quite basic, and with the carbs taking up so much precious intestinal space, the meal would have been all the better for it.  The name of the restaurant also begs the question: what contrasts? Again, the food was immaculately prepared, but whatever contrasts found therein were customary. Salt in contrast to the sweet. Crunch in contrast to the creamy. Red in contrast to the green. I would have expected nothing more from a 1-star restaurant. Surely the name isn’t a play on such basic knowledge in cooking? So if not the food, then where?  The choice of wines at times was not optimal to my taste. The cheese dish, consisting of maple syrup, blue cheese and ice cream would have fared better with a sweet white wine rather than the port-like red wine we were served. And I also wasn’t too fond of the Jura red wine with the sweetbread – too dry and acidic.   The choice of music was also unorthodox – ‘90s and 2000’s alternative rock. So long as the volume is set right it was unproblematic, but it did occur to me that the rowdy music doesn’t necessarily compliment the fine dining we were undertaking.  But make no mistake – Kontrast is a fantastic place to go for a very nice meal. You will feel welcome, you will be well taken care of, and you will have the most wonderful meal. Be it friends, colleagues or couples, this place will cater to your every need and desire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r800708768-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en
2021-07-25,Pjusken,"Unfortunately a disappointment. We had high expectations for the visit and the start was very promising with a warm welcome (but no one opened the door or greeted us by the door so we were a bit puzzled by that). The restaurant had many new dishes on the set menu that did not seem to have been tested out sufficient before it reached the table of the guest paying a lot for the food. When I dine at a Michelin restaurant I expect top-notch. I am wondering if this place would have had a star if it was located outside of Oslo? Both Re-Naa when it had one star (now 2 stars) and Speilsalen (visited a few months before they received a star) are way above in service, attendance and  food/wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d5551804-r799666093-Restaurant_Kontrast-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,3,en

2024-08-12,GPToak,"After anticipating this dining experience for many years, when we did go it was such a let down. Dominique Crenn, we learned on arrival, was enjoying the Olympic games in Paris. Perhaps ""the cat was away and the mice did play?"" but this was a substandard experience at a cost approaching $2,000 (2 tasting menus plus 2 wine tastings at the lowest-priced option).  This was the height of summer, we live locally and our veggies and fruits in our small urban garden are plentiful and very delicious. So, when we were told by one of the numerous wait staff that the Atelier Crenn ""farm"" (in Sonoma county) was being featured, and that the farmer had just come to the restaurant, we were excited to experience some summer produce......Well that was not to be the case.  The tasting menu ($395 each, paid in advance through ""Tock"" app - on which they enforce adding a 20% tip, 8.6% tax, and 2% additional service - i.e. 30.6% upcharge to the price) is touted as having 16 (i believe) courses.  Well, most of the  courses are very small bites, meaning that several will come with a wine pour. That's fine, but the actual bites were so underwhelming.  No fresh tomatoes, zucchinis, peppers, salads, or fruits such as tomatoes and stone fruits were on the menu. No! I lie.... one of the desert tasting bites did have a 3 extremely small slivers of santa rosa black plums on avocado. Which, since we grow them and know how delicious they should be, we pulled off the smashed avocado/guacamole tostada to taste -- and the plum was sour! Like from a grocery store in the midwest! (I know since I was just in the midwest and had the same disappointment).    There was another fresh item - fresh peas. That was our highlight of the meal. It had a great flavor, bright green color, and different textures that wowed our taste buds. The peas were an early tasting item, and unfortunately the rest of the bites were not so exciting. The other ""fresh"" item we enjoyed was a fried shiso leaf as part of their desert tasting bites and it made for a tasty surprise. A strawberry (one of the first courses) was described as green strawberry deconstructed and made into a mouse. It tasted rather odd and had a nasty texture. Talking of texture, we were not fans of the other mouse's they gave us. One was a walnut mouse which was rather plain tasting. I cannot tell you what the others were now.  There were 2 bread-ball courses. I prefer local Acme for breads, this was a rather uninspiring round ball - that at least helped fill our stomachs.  The different seafoods were pretty all disguised in different ways, the exceptions being a delicious crab broth, 2 shrimps served 2 ways (fried heads being one of them), plus there as a nice size bite of tuna - except it had gristle that after chewing I had to spit out! The server did not apparently notice this when clearing the plate (with a glob of chewed gristle), although the kitchen prep staff should not have served a piece with a gristle line.  I'd contacted the restaurant after the original booking since I had not added the ""drinks"" option to the ~$1,000 already paid when booking. I was told that the wine pairings were offered at $250, $480, and $1,225 depending on the wine list selected. Surprise! At the restaurant they offer these with the prices inclusive of all fees -- this means that you have no option but to pay 20% service (plus 2% additional service and the 8.6% tax) regardless. I'd have prefered to pay %15 on alcohol, but there you go.  Overall expect to pay a load of money - a 30.6% upcharge on any of their prices.  The atmosphere was good, the wait staff efficient  -- albeit several are difficult to understand especially when they are rushing through their descriptions, which several of the guys were. Our favorite server was from the actual kitchen and she was very descriptive plus friendlier, to be honest! The men were rather stuffy and arrogant and, as mentioned, talked rapidly, often with English as a second language, so we had to ask them to repeat sever times.  Our $300-a-person wine pairing was decent (we got the California wine selection), especially some of the wine pourings from southern CA. Our favorite was a light rose from Two Wolves in Santa barbara. That said, although we experienced some wines new to us, the pourings are small and they do not top you up (except one red which was stretched to several of the tasting ""courses"" and they told us would be repeated). In future (not that there probably will be - since it was that disappointing) I would order a bottle from the wine list and forgo the >$600 we paid on wine tastings.  The place is small and several people were in sneakers and jeans but others were more dressed up.  The place was not fully booked -- so perhaps they are not as popular anymore. I can understand if this is the case, this truly was a time that we were expecting a 5 star experience with the fresh local seafood and garden/farm produce. Instead it is more of a ""guess what this is"" and ""find the local fresh produce if you can"" experience we probably will not repeat -- there are many other options in San Francisco!  Hopefully Dominique will take note of this and things will revert to the experience she used to tout!  We left feeling very disappointed, but made a joke out of it when we told our friends. Really, it was too sad so we had to laugh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r964494277-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html,2,en

I’m equally impressed now as I was when I  first visited 18 months ago. Such freshness, such bold flavors, such creativity!  Seafood and Vegetables were the stars of the meal with the “cherry bomb,” the carrot and pea taco, the cauliflower and caviar,  and the beets and leche de tigre the standouts. The dry aged black cod with sides was superb. The restaurant’s redesign for 2023 gave it an airy and light feel.

Chef Crenn's techniques decomposed common ingredients and then reconstituted them artistically to create new flavors and texture.   The food was extremely delicate and required a lot of concentration to appreciate.  The meal reminded me of the wholesome California spirit of Chez Panisse in the 1970's, the sophistication and precision of Jamin in the 1980's, and the creativeness of Ferran Adria in the 2000's.   A thoroughly enjoyable dinner.   For wine, we had a 4 year old Corton Charlemagne from a vintage that is early maturing.  The wine tased like butter scotch in the first 45 minutes, evolved to pineapple cream in the next 45 minutes, but then shut down for the remaining meal.  Perhaps it needed 5 or 10 more years of aging.  ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r889591303-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html,5,en

2022-06-12,Hoyle L,"Atelier Crenn  After trying at least 3 different times, including a wait list, wife and I obtained a reservation for a midweek evening.    The restaurant accepts only pre-paid ($410 per person with add-ons for chef’s tasting menu, no other choice. Service included.) reservations with wine, supplements, etc. paid at end of meal. From the outset, the staff (perhaps as many as patrons) were welcoming, warm, and always attentive.  The layout is supposed to resemble at atelier with a central open space, some paintings, and a number of nooks, with framed poems on walls. There was also a sheet of poem on each table, a pretty long poem that took a while to read if you were so inclined.  The atmosphere was somewhat dignified and conducive until more patrons arrived and all talked and laughed loudly – then it became quite loud which was annoying for us sedate diners.  The 14+ course dinner (without wine pairing, but with a glass of champagne each, a half bottle of white wine, and a supplemental caviar course) was overall delicious including some unexpected delights, like the first course – an icy cold ball that burst in the mouth.  For a Pescatarian restaurant, however, we were much of the time unable to taste the pesces in the food.  Each dish was visually attractive, artfully prepared, intricately constructed (or deconstructed), many to be eaten in one bite. The teeny bites, however, were largely, very tasty.  There were several dishes, e.g. the deconstructed onion soup, black cod, that were identifiable, not teeny, and excellent.  The “moving feast” involved our moving, after the main course, to the Bar Crenn next door for the dessert and after dinner drinks following a brief tour through the kitchens.  Bar Crenn had the look of a 1920’s comfortable bar.  Overall, this atelier presents visually beautiful petite dishes, with very good to excellent taste and outstanding attentive service.  The final bill came to $1,200 of which $820 was prepaid at reservation.

Although the food was  presented beautifully, there was nothing extraordinary or memorable about and not one of us enjoyed any dish on the tasting menu. We also upgraded and added truffles to some of our dishes and even that didn't uplift the flavour. In addition, we added the wine pairing for an extra $250 per person and only 1 of the wines they paired, were enjoyable for us.  What was worse was my friend found a hair on her plate with the second dish and while they did apologise, no compensation of a glass of wine was offered. They didn't even appear embarrassed! If you are paying $395 per person and in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, you do not expect to find a hair in your food! Yes, mistakes happen but the restaurant did not even care or make up for it with a proper apology or a gesture of compensation, by a drink or something!  Although the staff were friendly, service was also slow. The atmosphere was also lacking and very pretentious. I can no stand places that give the feeling that their establishment is better than their patrons and their reaction to the hair on the plate compounded it! We were so disappointed.  Two days later, we found ourselves in Napa and at the French Laundry, which was absolutely amazing and restored my faith in what a real, 3 Michelin star restaurant is all about!

The chef and her staff totally understand all elements of restaurant hospitality, starting with the delicious and innovative menu, but extending to the ambiance and professional but incredibly friendly service. We selected the “movable feast” tasting menu experience and, after consultation with the Sommelier, the wine pairing (I note that the wine pairing was not at all “pushed”). Every course was beautiful and delicious. We have had the privilege to dine at what are considered some of the best restaurants in the world and Atelier Crenn is right up there with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r815869527-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html,5,en

2021-06-04,Jolly B,Growing up a meat eater in Texas doesn't prepare one for Atelier Crenn but Creen does make you happy you escaped the state for a healthier life in California!  From the very beginning of this experience the existential philosophy of ethical hedonism sustainability is stamped upon your forehead.  While the food is definitely fine art it is also belly friendly and the portion sizes are most definitely perfectly sized for  long evening.  Some other fine dining locations should take note.  At the close of the meal is the dessert courses which are nothing short of pure genius!  We were laughing at the table over the audacity of the creative team in the kitchen!  Our only critique of the evening would be the disappointment in the wine pairings especially as most of them had a heavy carbon footprint and were out of step with the local sustainability so well executed on the menu.  While there were some of the top Napa and Sonoma names on the greater wine list there was a decidedly lack of incorporation of these great local wines into the sustainable presentations.  An organic producer from Europe just doesn't meet the sustainability ethos.  When I return we will pay corkage or order some great local wines!  The abalone was ridiculous and made me remember the day I met George Moscone and had abalone at the  Waterfront.  Just a great day to remember!  Finally and most importantly the wait staff was impeccable!  But remember to bring your wallet as this joint isn't cheap!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r791181960-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html,5,en

2020-01-08,ULeadWillFollow,"We came for our wedding anniversary.  My husband had made the reservations a month before.  We went for the early seating. From the street, the location appeared pretty nondescript. We even walked passed it and had to double back. Upon entering, we were graciously  received by staff and escorted to our table.  The interior had a lot of wood, muted colors, with small area rugs that separated diners into their space.  There was poetry on the walls, which we were told, were written by Chef Crenn.  There were little paintings that are the work of her father. The entire place is a tribute to him.  Our servers were all gracious and informative.  It was not so easy to hear them because of the noise coming from the kitchen.  Our evening was punctuated by several people somewhere deep in the kitchen (I did not peek) saying or chanting something in unison, almost like a declaration of teamwork or something.  It was a little jarring after a while. We had to keep asking our servers to repeat their explanations. And it made the dining area noisy with the sounds bouncing.  I had a hard time hearing the music, although, once, when it was quiet for a few minutes, I heard David Bowie singing.  How apropos! Our food was served with so much aesthetic sense and beauty, I had to pause with each course just to admire them. Some courses were put together in front of us. Each dish did not just have this exquisite complexity that played out in our mouths.  The unique umami each delivered was either a welcome assault or an insidious flood of flavor followed by a lingering aftertaste that truly satisfied. The dish with the coarsely ground pumpkin seeds brought back childhood memories of when I went with my parents to my mother's home town.  I had not thought about that in decades! I had so many favorites: the dish that looked like a rose. The abalone.  The snow made of creme fraiche (I think) that topped seafood delight, that melted the minute I put it in my mouth.  The slow cooked eggyolk with all layers piled on top of it.  They had this walnut baguette that  had such a balanced taste, texture, and flavor, I would have wanted more, but I knew better than to ask.  There was still so much in store to come.  My husband is lactose intolerant but was willing to have a little dairy only.  They substituted ingredients so beautifully that the same dish was just was stellar.  The service was gracious, not overbearing or intrusive.  The team worked like members of a dance ensemble.  My husband told me that every time I came out of the bathroom, one of the staff came to check it.  The customer team was precise and meticulous with their attention to detail.   There are some restaurants with such high Michelin ratings I have been to where I said that once was good and enough.  But this one, I'd go back in a heartbeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2001299-r737922696-Atelier_Crenn-San_Francisco_California.html,5,en

That said, if you are a foodie, it is definitely worth a try, if only once. Been there, loved the food, will unlikely repeat a visit for reasons noted above.

Few weeks later the third star announcement! Every bite was a dance of flavors, balanced and complex, exciting and new but not in often “trying too hard to be original strangeness,” and also has down to earth comforting flavors as well. Do get the special addition of caviar. Worth the $$$. I appreciate the touch of Japanese influence in some of the dishes. One of the most memorable meals ever! Prefer over French Laundry..... Service elegantly choreographed but I wouldn’t mind slightly less formal. A gasp heard when tiny errant parsley or drop of foam noticed where it did not belong...haha. It’s okay! Beautiful elegant but low key room (some young ?tech dudes came in shorts and flip flops-sorry I think disrespectful to all the detail and artistry of Crenn; most patrons more tasteful and appropriately attired but not overdressed). Personal paintings by her father make it extra special. Meeting Chef Dominique Crenn who visited each table seemed natural unforced and was lovely. My teens especially loved the multi-course desserts! Hope not too difficult to make a future reservation now given the third star for this SF jewel.

2024-05-24,schmausen123,"Totally overambitious ""philosophy ideas"" concept that in no way (!!!) ends up on the plate. The gourmet testers must have had a completely different evening, or who knows what... When you register by phone, the question about the menu is answered with: ""The chef creates new ideas every day"" - unfortunately, that's exactly true. I have ideas every day too, but they should end up on the plate. There is only a time window of about 30 minutes in which you can show up. Then there is the greeting in the back courtyard (""are we all doing well!!!"" yes - tschaka...); then the overly long ego-philosophical instruction by the maitre in the ""experimental library"" (actually a cold warehouse...); then (in the restaurant opposite) the corridors to the snack bar follow - they are all nice, but that's all. then comes the snack - which is good - but I can get that from my butcher for a fraction of the price; then a course with raw char topped with coarse sorrel leaves (picked personally in the morning, of course) - on top of that an ultra-buttery mixture (with a strong miso taste); by the way, everything somehow always tastes of fermented miso; almost penetrating) and a few lungwort petals that were also picked on the morning walk (corresponds to the ""philosophy"" mentioned above); thank God the char can be saved. then the next course is a ""12-year-old cow"" - that is, a fibrous, tough braised piece of the 12-year-old cow from which we were already able to enjoy the sausage (which was good); then a bit of dessert. at the end there are elderflowers baked in lard dough as a ""bonus and gift"" - they taste really good. paltry price = 235 euros (when I asked if there was a flat rate for water, I was given a flippant answer: ""whatever you want, you can drink yourself a water belly."" Water and coffee are included; no one in the service tells you this beforehand) - as for the wine accompaniment, which is available from the snack onwards: first a beer (delicious), then orange wine (horrible), then a medium-class white wine until the end - for a total of 125 euros!!! are you serious? and when I then read in gourmet guides or comments that this is a competitor to the ""essigbrätlein"" - then I honestly and truly know that there is absolutely no clue or something else going on here. By the way, the whole ""open kitchen concept"" with far too loud music (from disco to rap) and then of course correspondingly loud entertainment for the guests has the ""event character"" -- but do you really have to have it for 4 hours and end up paying 400 euros per person?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d25238809-r952203211-Etz-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,2,en

Almost everything from bread to butter, sausages, vinegars, etc. is made in-house and purchased directly from - usually regional - producers.

You sit practically in the middle of it all - very close to the action and can watch the etz team create the individual courses. The atmosphere is totally relaxed.

The whole restaurant works like clockwork. The food and the accompanying wine are of course beyond any rating. It remains a deep and formative experience in top gastronomy.  What I would like to particularly emphasize here is that there is really no cliché that applies to etz.  The atmosphere was so incredibly relaxed.

We got the reservation bu chance since we are staying in the region and did not plan the visit ahead. Very professional service, great choice of wine (we took the house Barolo - very elegant and reasonably priced too). The dishes were an inspiration - play with textures, ingredients, and truly a visual experience - more like art when it comes to serving. Probably best sea urchin i had.

2022-01-03,ingconti,"We were there on 30th dec 2021, to anticipate new Year's Eve dinner. it is a 3 starred restaurant so expectations are high (this is our 4th 3 stars restaurant).  A bit disturbing to be placed on a list to be admitted and giving credit card in advance... (we have already experienced he same at Gordon Ramsey years ago, but we cannot appreciate it...)  To be clear: it's a very good place with high levels of services and cousine, but in this palce every details counts. We ate all coures with truffle added..  PRO: - service is very good - course are cared and very well presented. - wine list is remarkable - sommelier, even if very young, is a clever and smart lady. - at the end the chef did appear to thank hosts: a gentle touch. -truffle is very good. nice interiors. - to be a 3stars, price is interesting (we spent a similar price at 1 starred in Milan... (see review..)  CONS: - fixed menu: in a 3 stars we can expect the cook for us following our desires,  a bit rough we had to eat their proposal without knowing them in advance. - place is a bit hidden: address is ""piazza duomo"" but we and other hosts failed to find it: is in a small street near. - usual un-polite strangers: the chat aloud, and maitre did not say a word.. :( - we honestly expected more from a 3 *.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194664-d1492721-r823904423-Piazza_Duomo-Alba_Province_of_Cuneo_Piedmont.html,4,en
2021-11-18,Yukari K,"Piazza Duomo marked the end of two solid days of eating white truffles throughout the area - this is our fourth trip to Alba. We were at Piazza Duomo with a friend and of course we ordered the truffle menu. The first thing we were astonished by was to learn that the 270 euro price did not include the price of any truffles, which were charged by each gram we used. The price of the truffles was 13 euros a gram, more than 2x the street price (the price charged at well-reputed trattorias), which seemed egregious. Our Italian friend who eats in Alba every year was shocked by this system.   Needless to say, their ""generosity"" shaving truffles on our dishes seemed more extractive than generous (whereas we left a meal the previous night with the exact opposite impression of a restaurant that included the truffle cost in the price of the menu)  Most of the dishes were very good, and the chef's reputation is well deserved. There was only one dish that missed the mark. Like so many other chefs, this chef also tried to pair truffles with chicken, perhaps to marry the simple with the sublime? Either way, it rarely works, and his dish didn't either. He actually had a delicious marsala sauce on it that married well with the flavor of the truffles. We all scraped the sauce off the chicken and ate that with the truffles. We ate the chicken separately.  The chef is reputed to be known in Italy for his experience in Japan, and he is known to marry the east with the west in his cooking. As a Japanese national who is intimately familiar with Japanese cuisine, I must say that I saw little trace of that influence. His weakness in fact appears to be vegetables, even though that is a big element in Japanese cuisine (to be fair we did not have the salad he's supposedly famous for). There was one savory custard dish that was stunning that could possibly have  been influenced by the Japanese chawanmushi though it also could have been a variation of the sformato.   The biggest issue here is the service. We found the wait staff to be pushy, impersonal and lacking in knowledge. The descriptions of the dishes were perfunctory at best, a recitation of the ingredients. Chefs that produce dishes of this caliber usually like to share the story about the source of the ingredients or the intentions behind the dish, but the descriptions were little more than a recitation of the ingredients. We also would've expected the servers to be a little more excited and engaged in the dishes, but you almost got a sense of boredom from them. Incidentally, when my husband went to the restroom, he saw three of the servers chatting amongst themselves with no attention on the guests.   At the end of the dinner, the server presented us with a menu for eight different coffees. When we asked for the difference between them, they were unable to tell us more than how one had the flavor of chocolate or another had a little more acidity than the others. Or that all of them were 100% arabica beans. If you are charging 15 euros for high-end espresso, they should have a little more information than that.   If you come here, you will for sure have a wonderful meal, but for us once was enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194664-d1492721-r819207124-Piazza_Duomo-Alba_Province_of_Cuneo_Piedmont.html,3,en

This experience was simply amazing and from start to finish we were in complete awe of the service and food.  We made reservation well in advance and were greeted by a great team of people.  From that point on we were just blown away.  The wine list was extensive, easy to navigate and well laid out.  As far as the food goes there just aren't enough adjectives to describe it.  We ordered the Insalata 21, 31,41, 51...., the herb encrusted lamb loin and a pasta dish with chunks of fresh seafood but so much more came out!  Beef tartare  that was disguised as olives, an array of little dishes with little treats and so much more!!! We could have not ended our honeymoon on a better note.

I had nothing to complain of and nothing to ask for, because they were ahead of the game every step of the diner during the entire night. Well done!   I am gluten free and they serve me the best buckwheat beignet, tagliolini, and cappelletti I ever had before and after becoming sensitive to gluten.

2024-09-28,Bryan L,"I don’t usually write reviews like this, but Hisa Franko truly deserves it. A few years back, my wife became obsessed with Netflix, particularly the show Chef's Table. After watching the episode featuring ANA ROS, she was adamant: “Yes, let’s go to Slovenia!”   Unfortunately, we couldn’t secure a reservation at the restaurant, so we opted to stay in the heart of Kobarid. From the moment we arrived, we felt incredibly welcomed. It was like visiting family—warm and inviting, a feeling you never want to leave behind. The selection of aperitifs was outstanding, with thoughtfully crafted cocktails and non-alcoholic options made by the Hisa Franko team, along with local beers and Slovenian wines.  We dined in a cozy red room adorned with paintings, kombucha jars, and lovely carpets. It felt just like being in our own living room. The food was absolutely incredible, and the funky wine we tried was the best my wife and I have ever tasted. A huge thank you to Manuel, Tylen, Alejandro, and the rest of the team who made our evening so memorable.  At the end of our meal, we had the opportunity to tour the kitchen, guided by the wonderful Lisa, who shared insights about its layout and operations. We were also taken to the wine and cheese cellar—what a treat! They age their own cheeses there.  I can’t express enough gratitude to the entire Hisa Franko team. You made our time in Slovenia unforgettable and definitely worth a return visit, even though it’s not just around the corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r971760402-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html,5,en

With wine pairing at $170 /person, one would expect better. One of selections smelled strongly of sulfur—it should have been decanted in advance. Another was obviously corked & unfit to drink. Nevertheless, the sommelier refused to replace the glass with something else. It is unbelievable to me that a two star restaurant would allow a few ounces of wine to deminish a patron's experience!

2024-09-13,Chaiko2014,"First the good.  Ms Franko's food is extremely creative, mostly delicious and a wonderful journey through nature and all the flavor combinations you've never had.  Pretty much all the dishes were delicious - all 7 courses - though some were exceptional, most were flavors and combinations that were unfamiliar but unique and delicious. We had a tasting menu with which I had the ""Juicy"" pairing of homemade kombuchas, juices, and elixirs.  They were good with the food and definitely worth one try.  The bad?  There was a stone in my food that cracked my tooth.  We put the stone and my piece of tooth on a napkin which they took to the kitchen, came back, verified that it was a stone and said, ""sorry.""  I guess to me, for a $600+ meal, that wasn't good enough.  So, as you wade through the grass sandwiches and ""unifying with nature"" beware that it is possible that their preparation did not purge these delicacies from the rocks that also come in nature.

The plates are thought out and designed to the smallest of detail. I was simply amazed by the taste from course to course (""I was blown away by the salad and the fruit praline: how can you achieve such a taste with raw food?"") .The courses follow each other in a well-thought-out order, where it seems that each plate prepares you for the next one and at the same time, together they form a story. Not only that prestigious ingredients (trout, venison, oysters) shine in this story but sublime are also humble barley, polenta, carrots, potatoes, sour cream. A tribute to the authentic Slovenian home cooking cannot be overlooked here, and as a Slovenian guest I am extremely grateful for it.   Not only the food is superb, but also the service: I don't know if I ever felt so welcomed, relaxed, anywhere.   I thought this dinner would be a once in a lifetime experience, but now I can't wait to come back.

2024-03-31,dr_aaltonen,"There is a nice lounge with fireplace where aperitif is served. Dinner room is next to it. Food was obviously very good. There were few misses too, which were little unexpected. Dining took too long time. I entered to the restaurant 19:15 and left it (not having extra cheese, coffee or digestive) at 23:30. Service was professional and friendly. Wine pouring was very small, especially when all wines were meant for multiple dishes. Some wines were poured more, but it didn’t leave a good feeling. 17 courses including amuse bouche, if you can call it that, size of all the portions was more or less the same throughout the dinner: 1. Caviar, etc. Spicy, good, too big for one bite, impossible to cut with spoon provided 2. Crab, etc. Good size, good taste 3. Plant sandwich. Again two big for one bite, difficult to cut by teeth into two 4. Donut with smoked roe. Very good! 5. Potato with a salty crest. Absolutely awful! Crest was unbelievable salty. Potato was potato 6. Spring harvest. Okay, nothing special 7. Peas. Excellent! 8. Taglioni. Too salty again!  9. Trout. Good 10. Capperletti. Very good! 11. Barley. Some of it was raw, not good 12. Lamb pelmeni. Spicy, good 13. Meat on two pieces. Good, although difficult to cut ingredients with spoon and fork 14. Carrot ice-cream to clear palate. A bit strange but not bad 15. Sweet potato dumpling. Very sweet, more kind of a cheese portion 16. One strawberry. Well, strawberry, not very good one 17. Spicy pumpkin. Candy Optional cheese was offered after the dessert…?!  Classy wine pairing: 1.

2023-10-20,Marie5466,"Where do you begin when everything is so appetizing, well put together, tantalizing, unexpected, and flavorsome? When more than your sense of taste, is involved and you get a balanced experience between sight, touch, smell, and feel.  An incredible dance for the palate.  First, they start with a heavy white bowl filled with wonderful, freshly picked, damp forest moss and ask you to feel it and smell it as a connection back to nature, a grounding to the present, which is what their menu represents.  A bond, an association with the richness of nature’s many tastes, textures, colors, smells, and more.  A connection to the local area, to now.  From the Fifty Shades of Life menu, a wink to Ana Roš and Hiša Franko Restaurant turning 50!  Hoping for many more based on my experience here.   In awe of each dish (there were 18 of them – including the one you bring home), I kept wondering where such unfathomable creativity comes from.  What kind of genius dreams-up stuff like that?   Fig leaf granita mixed with puffed buckwheat?  Beeswax fondue?  Shiso leaf with mescal infused melon?  Fig leaf kombucha tea.   The staff flowed through the tables, the outside patio, and all the rooms effortlessly and seamlessly.  Whatever they promised, they never forgot to do.  For example, they knew where I came from and one of their chef comes from the same part of Canada so at the end of the meal (at which point I had forgotten they would connect us) we met and it turns out he came from a mere 20km from where I do.  Small world.  Staff seems to be from many places, our server was from Colorado, USA, that chef from Québec, Canada, and many more.  There was no stuffy orchestration even though the coordination was flawless.  Even if you can’t or don’t want to drink alcohol, they have wonderful selections.  I tried two of their Kombucha teas and both were marvelous, especially the fig leaf one (excellent and super refreshing, almost like a palate cleanser between courses).  It’s definitely not only about the presentation, the food, and the ambiance.  What I also appreciated was just how connected the staff were with one another.  Also their obvious love of the food.  No matter how obscure a question was, they had an answer.  I didn’t, for example, know what a lacto-fermented tomato water was (PS.  It has nothing to do with milk).  Once it was described to me, it helped me better understand the food I was served.  So it is not only a tasting experience, but also a learning one.    I had a bit of a fear of coming to my first Michelin restaurant because I thought it would be a stodgy, pretentious place.  As it turned out, everyone was very approachable, candid, polite, inquisitive, and fun, all the while attentive and professional.  I could go on, but I’ll let you go and enjoy a meal there.  I felt alive when I finished my meal despite the full stomach and the late hour.  The portions and pace of each serving were perfect so I never felt overloaded.  I would say, only one course wasn’t as good as all the others (too salty), the rest were all excellent and surprising.  Kudos to this amazing team who pulls this miracle night after night.  Thank you for the great experience.  When checking out, you receive a menu signed by Ana herself accompanied by a specially made candy to take home.  I am glad that my first Michelin experience was here.  It will be hard to surpass.    OF NOTE:  You cannot add a tip to your credit card bill so bring some cash if you want to tip.

2023-08-16,David H,"I am not sure, where to start. Having a reservation for about 9 months, it was too long of a wait :) but worth it. We have booked the dine and stay option and I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting Hisa (the breakfast is totally worth it :D ) Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Svetlana, shown to our room and went for a late lunch. Tilen recommended a fantastic local bubbly, and it went together just excellently with the local cheeses on offer. The setting of Hisa is unique, so we basked in a summer sun, sipped on the bubbles in the blooming garden and chilled. Dinner: 17 courses, spanning across 3-4 hours, plus an option for a cheese board, go for it. Fantastic selection of wines at very reasonable prices. Having a really bad experience from a 1star restaurant in Berlin recently, our worries faded away immediately after the opener and we just felt great, going on a culinary journey on and on. Is 17 dishes little or too much? Just right I would say, in Hisa´s case. Staff: WONDERFUL. We had so much fun, as Maria, being from US, suddenly spoke to us in Czech the evening took a different spin, it was great. The sommelier, young lady, was spot on. We did not opt for the wine pairing, but went instead for a superb 2008 blanc de blancs grand cru, couple glasses of wonderful reds and finished it off with an amazing Tokai.   This was an experience worth waiting for and if we ever have a chance to visit again, we won´t hesitate. Greatest thanks to Tilen, Svetlana, Maria and rest of the staff. You are guys doing a fantastic job and you can be proud of it. Hope to see you soon again.

2023-06-27,Captain_Kirk2017,"I stopped in at Hisa Franko for lunch on June 1 2023 to enjoy what I expected to be another spectacular meal at a Michelin star restaurant.  Unfortunately the meal… maybe it was the mussel or maybe it was the timothy hay crusted potato or something else, …gave me food poisoning and made me violently ill for the following 24 hours.  Not a pleasant experience on your vacation!  There was no other possible source than the meal at Hisa Franko.  It was not a flu virus.  To add insult to injury when I indicated to Hisa Franko what had happened they were not apologetic nor would they refund the cost of my meal.  While I understand that mistakes can happen I cannot understand their staunch denial that I could get sick from their meal.  As I said before, there was no other possible source.  Perhaps they need to understand that the customer’s experience is not all about the story of the preparation of the food but also how the customer feels once they leave the restaurant.  I had much more pleasant experiences eating other Slovenian food elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r898412936-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html,1,en

2022-11-29,V M,"Hisa Franco is well know due to its' two Michelin starred restaurant. It features limited number of hotel rooms. The rooms are nicely & homely decorated offering the basics for overnight stay, but sadly no air conditioning what you would expect in this level locations.   The two stars are setting expectation level to the top. The check in was very smooth and professional. We were invited for aperetifs before dinner, but this turned out that we were to order drinks from their menu. The set up outdoors was though very nice.  The restaurant venue is classy and stylish. The service was overwhelming. The food (tasting menu) was extensive and very nicely presented. Sadly the tastes were often a bit mild and basically all food was eaten with your fingers. The wine package of local wines was just ok, nothing really special.   Chef Ana Ros visited the tables many time what was really nice.  Breakfast was as a whole a nice experience. Just surprising that you are expected to pay extras for your coffees and teas.   All in all, a nice experience but sadly did not meet our expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g319788-d1059106-r870106499-HISA_FRANKO-Kobarid_Slovenian_Littoral_Region.html,4,en

The Lacto Fermented tomato water, elderberry, elderberry and tarragon Pastrami beef tongue, jalapeño and crystal algae      Was that it was so shocking flavorful, I needed another one to really taste it.  It was wonderful.   The only disappointment was a dish I was thinking could have been a highlight. Potato baked in August hay crust, cultured butter with lovage and horseradish. The potato was only mildly warm, and the butter was very cold as to not melt on the potato, so not capturing the whole favor of the dish.  Something that both should have been warmer,  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, wines were very good.  Having worked in the past in the food service industry, I found it is nice to be recognized by upper management.  With only 7 tables it shouldn't have been hard to either say hi or ask about the meal.  While both manager and chef were out on the floor, this did not happen.

From the moment of our arrival, to aperitif (Mountain sour=TOP), dinning experience which each plate is taking you somewhere else but you are constantly in Slovenia with carefully picked ingredients.

2024-09-09,Rebecca P,"We went to Bruto last week. My husband and I enjoyed it and were glad we went, but we won't be going back and we won't be recommending it either.  The service was just OK (Nick was great) but the $600 bill (without any of the liquor pairings) for 2 was more than we thought was justified. They did mention three times while introducing courses that this was a ""Fine Dining"" experience - that struck me as strange. I suppose since little old Denver only has three one-star restaurants we don't recognize a fine dining establishment.  Last comment - both the men's and women's bathrooms had a horrendous sewage odor. One worker chalked it up to the fact that the restrooms are in the basement of an old building. Regardless, it's rough to experience a raw sewage smell in the middle of a ""Fine Dining"" experience. So, if you go, try not to use the bathrooms!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d21502908-r969072589-Bruto-Denver_Colorado.html,3,en

I chose to do the wine pairing so he also explained the story behind each wine, making the experience even more interesting.

Chef-Owner Michael DeLeon Diaz is very talented as well as personable. It was fun to sit and watch all the activity in the kitchen. We started with the house signature bread called piada made in the oven that was blazing, and inviting, when we walked in. As with all of the dishes in the chef’s choice menu, it was delicious and unusual. The staff was professional, well-informed and delightful too. We started with the really great spring tortilla. The dishes that followed included a wonderful fish dish, a pasta that was excellent, a bison dish and then dessert. Rather than detailing the exquisite tastes, we just encourage you to get a reservation! We spent about $250 without alcohol (there is a non-alcoholic pairing option that we didn’t have).

2024-09-21,Eva,"Vespertine is an avant-garde dining experience unlike any other, blending food, art, architecture, and atmosphere into a truly surreal evening. It is not just dinner—it is a sensory journey.  Housed in a futuristic, strikingly modern building, designed by renowned architect Eric Owen Moss, Vespertine immerses you the moment you arrive. The design is minimal yet intense, setting a mysterious tone. Everything—from the music to the lighting outside—feels deliberately curated to heighten the experience.  The multi-course tasting menu is incredibly inventive, with each dish resembling a work of art. The flavors are complex, leaning heavily on textures and unusual ingredient pairings. While some dishes are astonishingly good, others may feel more like an experiment than a satisfying bite. It is a meal that is meant to provoke thought as much as it hopes to please the palate. Chef Kahn’s mission is to take you on a journey of things that are special and inspirational to him. Much like an artist.   Highlights were for me: Wild Scallop (1st dish), Deep Ocean - sweet prawn with white nectarines (3rd dish in ice), Obsidian Mirror - smoked mussel with squid ink and plum (4th dish), Layers - Black raspberry and brown sugar crips (12th dish).   Service is attentive, but in a very controlled, almost theatrical way. The staff maintains the tone of the experience, which is formal and synthesized. When placing or removing dishes, each movement was perfectly orchestrated. Every course is explained in great detail, however, brief enough that you’re not getting a novel and are enthusiastically asked to enjoy. As the evening winded down, commencing on 4 hours, the staff took time to talk with me about their path in life, how they feel working with Chef Jordan Kahn and their aspirations. I truly enjoy conversations like that, even after 11 PM.   Vespertine is not for everyone. It’s a deeply conceptual dining experience that feels more like attending an art installation than sitting down for dinner. For those open to experimental cuisine and willing to embrace the abstract, it’s an unforgettable evening.   However, if you're seeking traditional fine dining or comfort, Vespertine may feel more challenging and a bit out there. Expensive, perhaps and definitely daring, it’s an adventure meant for curious palates. Definitely worthy of 2 Michelin Stars!!  This will be a treat each time I come to LA which I hope will be often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r970772131-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en

It was truly amazing. the positive vibes began with an email inquiry about a certain ingredient which was answered quickly even though the restaurant was not open on that day. Thank you Megan. When we picked up the meal it was beautifully boxed and contained a sheet with a description of each dish and detail reheating instructions. the food was inventive and unique which has always been a forte of Chef Kahn. We are not big eaters and had no difficulty in getting two complete meals out of what was billed as servings for two. We do not eat meat and a vegetarian experience like this was truly delightful. Sort of wish they would do a vege or pescetarian  meal more often.It was a very good value for the quantity and quality of the food and the expert take out service and ""presentation.""

2020-04-27,DLLLA,"My partner ordered pick-up and told me we were having a date night some seven weeks into quarantine.  Music on, candles lit, wine breathing, dress AND make-up on ... quite an effort after living in yoga pants and sweats for weeks.  He arrived with the bag, complete with menu cards and a note ""We encourage you to enjoy tonight's menu in a celebratory fashion and allow these offerings to provide temporary respite from the circumstances.""   Perfect.   I am from New Orleans and my mother is a southern belle and I was lucky enough to be raised by my parents who's passion was cooking dinner together almost every evening, including cocktail hour, and our meals were gourmet delights.   This southern comfort food knocked me down into a sensory delight from the first to last dish.  I think I was 'Geechee Gullahed"" as the chef explained on the card.   Finger licking explosion of flavors, and this is where your love affair begins as one must use their fingers while eating boiled peanuts.  I hadn't had boiled peanuts since I was a little girl on my grandfather's farm.  The pimento cheese spread on the perfect crisps was like the 4th of July in my mouth and oh so savory.  The corn bread/pudding was some of the best I've ever had and along with the greens?!  Heaven and childhood sent.  The grits ... never have there been such a fabulously textured and flavorful southern staple.  The garden box was a sight to behold ... the most beautiful vegetable grouping with a sauce divine.  The prawns in their rich broth with delicate purple fingerlings and corn on the cob.  Again, fingers in good use and licking good.  The sweet potato ... small bundles of caramelized molasses mini explosions and every bite eaten.  The desserts ... I don't normally eat pralines, but it was the most delicious confectionary treat and every single bite was savored with gratitude.  Thank you Vespertine for sharing my childhood times 1000.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r752970950-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en

I've been to 6 of the 7 3-star places in CA and this visit was one stop of three 2-star LA joints over a long weekend. The theater of the experience was a strong point. You start outside, stop briefly on the 2nd floor to to greet the chief, then up to roof for first courses, etc, Lots of motion. The food was very good but not 3-star life changing or even close.  Some of the dishes were visually quite stunning, but none were emotionally evocative. The drink pairings were a notable weak point. The descriptions were terse (e.g., red wine from northern California) and the interplay with the food was unremarkable. After the main meal, we were escorted back to the uncomfortable outside siting area for an overwhelming number of last bites. The whole experience was more food-based visual art/theater rather than simply great food in the spirit of Manresa or Benu.    Do I appreciate the art of  Vespertine? Absolutely, Would I return there compared to other more food-centric  LA locations like Providence?

I don;t want them to increase the price at all. It was well worth every penny though.  Only to slightly negative comments #1 Coffee is $10 - this is fine but I was asked if I wanted another and it wasn't clear. That I was being charged for the 2nd coffee which was cold and I only took one small pour of. I won't make that mistake again! totaling $20... hmm  #2   The only dish I didn't like was a course that looks very interesting! It looks like asphalt  but is very salty.  Besides these two comments...  I want to return the next time I'm in LA & OH I LOVED the quail and every course. I was stuffed at the end and that's how I like to feel.

2019-09-08,Nostromo42,"Vespertine is a once in a lifetime experience. There were at least 20 small dishes, I may have lost count. Several included flowers that were consumed. Everything was impeccable, service, decor, ambiance. At the beginning you are seated in the outdoor garden (where you return after the end of the meal), then you are taken to the 3rd floor to meet the chef then back to the 2nd floor to eat. The building is an art form especially designed for the restaurant. The clothing of wait staff and cooks all custom designed. The dishes, food containers, utensils all designed by various artists. The background music is specially composed by a friend of the chef. It goes on... The wine to go with the tasting menu was perfect. My only criticism is that there was no singular main dish. At the end of the meal we were full but had not had a major specially satisfying dish. For the price, it was an experience I would only do once.

2019-06-11,hostelguy1,"This year's birthday dinner at Vespertine stirred up quite the reaction whenever I mentioned it. But probably my favorite response was watching my husband's face as I read the official press materials, describing it as ""a place of shadows and whispers.""   He looked confused, but I continued -- explaining it would be a 20+ course meal, consisting mostly of unidentifiable food, served on dinnerware that looked more at home on the Starship Enterprise than say, in Culver City. Plus, the entire wait staff wore frocks that resembled the wardrobe from The Handmaid's Tale.  Like a good husband, he agreed to go without too much resistance. And booked the reservation -- paying a required upfront cost of $250 per person (not including drinks). Clearly, this isn't a cheap date. But I didn't view this as a typical dinner out. It's more of a performance piece.   Chef Jordan Kahn has quite an impressive resume -- working at some of the country's most notable restaurants including Chicago's Michelin-starred Alinea and Thomas Keller's Per Se (at 17-years-old, the youngest-ever to work in Keller's kitchen). Plus, the great food critic Jonathan Gold ranked Vespertine as his no. 1 pick on his very last ""101 Best Restaurants"" list in Los Angeles.  Each of the dishes were unique -- but honestly, our favorite part was getting the backstory on each entree and trying to figure out how to eat it. Plus, when you have 20+ dishes, it's tough to narrow it down. We pretty much enjoyed all of them. But we appreciated the spectacle of it the most -- like the choreographed routine of the wait staff when delivering a dish.  The building has also been described as a spaceship. The chef even went as far as telling GQ Magazine that the building is ""a machine artifact from an extraterrestrial planet"" and that it was ""left here a billion years ago by a species that were moon worshipers,"" and that the building ""has its own gravity."" Whatever the case -- we thought it was pretty cool!  Before heading out, they served 3 more aperitifs, hot tea and sliced fruit. And just when I thought I couldn't drink or eat anything else, the last frock-wearing waiter for the evening asked if we'd like to ""revisit"" anything else. We kindly passed. After all, we've returned to Earth -- and felt about 10 pounds heavier. Maybe they were right after all -- that Vespertine is a spaceship and has no gravity inside. Now only if they could make that magic happen when I weigh myself next at the gym!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r680857007-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en
2019-06-09,RonWamberal,"It's obviously ""dressed to impress""; an amazing architectural feat as part of a rejuvenation of a whole suburb. But as someone who is a design tragic and fanatic, it almost left me cold. Everything is choreographed like a Broadway show or Oscar Awards Evening, nothing is left to chance but it lacks warmth and spontaneity. Yes, it's just been awarded 2 stars by Michelin and yes, it won a recent award for best restaurant in the world for atmosphere but that says more about the building than for the team. The first step was to head to the top floor and see the views over L.A. - I was taken upstairs and met the main man but then taken immediately downstairs; missed what others say is a highlight. Then a series of dishes arrive, obviously all perfect and wonderful but as you don't get a menu, you struggle to remember what you have eaten days later. It's now 2 months later and my trip memories are more on the personal side; e.g meeting and talking to chefs like Dave Beran at Dialogue, Kyle Connaughton at Single Thread, David Bouley of Bouley at Home and the teams at Alinea and Eleven Madison - they all brought a personal touch that is missing at Vespertine It's a night that I'll treasure but more as a point of saying I've been here.

2019-04-03,SFGourmet,"My wife and I have spent the past several years traveling around the world to try different restaurants, and we have eaten at more than 1/2 the Pellegrino 50.  Little do we know that the #1 restaurant in the world is right here in the good old U.S. of A.!!!   The combination of the environment, the presentation, the food, and the service is head and shoulder above all the other restaurants.  There are other places with better presentation (Single Thread), more out-of-the-world food (Tickets), service (Guy Savoy), or environment (many Parisian restaurants), but Vespertine makes the entire package work.   My wife ordered the non-alcoholic pairing, and it was amazing.  I had the full wine pairing and I probably would never have ordered those wine on my own, but they worked perfectly with the food.  My recommendation is to add the non-alcoholic pairing on top of the full wine pairing in order to get the complete experience.   My only complaint is that the staff did not offer us any beverage paring.  After 3 courses, I had to flag down a server to let him know that we wanted the paring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r663593043-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en
2019-01-11,Bill R,"So we finally had the opportunity for dinner at the highly lauded but wildly polarizing Vespertine in Los Angeles. It was a special event sponsored by Marriott, so the tasting menu was slightly abridged and the regular introduction to dinner on the upper terrace was done slightly differently than normal. But we also had an opportunity to meet and speak with Chef Kahn.  We loved it. The food, the wine pairings, the service, the ambience, the building, the music, the views, the pacing. Everything was superb.  Considering how supposedly “weird” this restaurant is, we found it not nearly that weird. Having dined only a few weeks ago at Atelier Crenn in San Francisco and several years ago at Alinea (Kahn used to work there), Vespertine was not nearly as avant garde as some had pronounced. Yet the creations were majestically beautiful, always unique, with combinations and new flavor assortments like I’d never had before. The critique that the food is too much like art was subjourned by its complexity and almost ubiquitous deliciousness—that more than a few times crept up on you, almost surprising you pleasantly after a first bite or two that left you curious. The food was most definitely surprising. A few dishes were presented in dishware that precluded us from really seeing what we were eating, and that for us was the only “weird” part of our dinner, actually.  Our favorites were most certainly the hen, the shrimp, and the rhubarb dessert. And the mushroom starter. But everything was very good...and many of the dishes were full of textural combinations that really surprised and delighted.   We’d also read that service could be heartless and cold, but we experienced nothing of the sort. Service was a bit formal by LA standards, but the servers smiled, were friendly and knowledgeable. And they certainly wanted to see us enjoy our meal. We kidded around with a few of them, and they responded in kind.  We’d return in in a heartbeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r645176685-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en

2018-10-21,Monica H,"Vespertine is the most unique dining experience I have encountered in a tasting menu restaurant.  The modern garden and building with concrete, glass and steel set a stunning backdrop to artistic and unique flavorful dishes and beverages.  We experienced the Autumn menu and I particularly liked the Douglas fir and Redwood enfused beverages and varied uses of edible plants and flowers.  Both a wine and a non-alcoholic pairing are offered so one who doesn't drink alcohol can enjoy unique beverage pairings with the meal.  We had the wine pairing which also included a french champagne and a crafted beer paired with one of the dishes.  This is truly a unique experience for all of the senses.

2018-09-28,CIHTravels,"Last night Providence, tonight Vespertine, tomorrow night Dialogue.  This was my second visit to Vespertine but this time I was on my own – an interesting distinction. Normally I don’t mind eating out on my own but, as noted in my previous TripAdvisor review of Vespertine, acceptance of the challenges at Vespertine requires a suspension of ‘normal’ expectations – one of the key reasons for going to a restaurant is human interaction but the importance of this, in my case anyway, would appear to vary directly with the challenge the restaurant presents.  This goes to the heart of the hospitality experience. The idea of the “companion” (from the Old French compaignon, literally ‘one who breaks bread with another’, based on Latin com ‘together with’ + panis ‘bread’) as an integral part of a meal.  I’m certainly not suggesting I did not enjoy this visit. On the contrary, I loved it. It is still an extraordinary experience and one I will, hopefully, continue to revisit. But, I have to admit to that “slight unease” that Jonathan Gold has referred to when discussing Vespertine – nobody to turn to and say “wow” or “what the…” or “how do we…” or raise an eyebrow or smile or nod knowingly; nobody to share the challenge. And the end, what they call “After Dinner” (which is quite simply the best ending to any restaurant experience I have had), definitely requires that companion.  So, what was different about this visit aside from being alone?   One slight negative was that my visit began in daylight – a combination of an early reservation and summer (my previous visit was in winter) – and the view from the roof, where one starts the evening, is definitely better at night with the city’s lights and the stars; in the daylight the view is more of warehouses and industrial spaces! And the night somehow keeps you enclosed in the experience.  There were several different dishes from my previous visit but the process was the same and the focal point remained the challenge, the immersion into Jordan Kahn’s world – into his restaurant experience? I’m still searching for the definitive definition of the restaurant experience but am now thinking there is an overarching concept of hospitality with different ways of achieving it, and this is definitely one of them.  Chef Jordan Kahn worked at Alinea at the same time as Chef Dave Beran of Dialogue in Santa Monica where I dined the following evening…there is clearly a common thread – neither are a Providence – but they are also clearly very different.  Meeting expectations is obviously a more difficult ask the second time around – one knows what to expect, the expectations are no longer vicarious. And this applies doubly in such a place as Vespertine where the restaurant experience is so different; surprise is no longer such a powerful factor.   So, given all that, did it meet expectations? Yes! Expectation is replaced by anticipation. Even though you know, or have an idea, of what’s coming it’s still something to look forward to. And would I go again? Oh yes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r620132986-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en

It's a gustatory and sensory 360 immersion in the chef/owner's vision of future fine dining - difficult to sum up, but at one point I found myself thinking that I'd been transported to a kind of friendly Blade Runner 2049 scenario.  The food was almost faultless, full of subtleties and surprises.  The service was impeccably well informed and … almost kindly, as if the staff know that their customers are going to be somewhat bewildered and will need some friendly advice.  The architecture would be worth a visit on its own.  Overall, a once-in-a-lifetime experience - although I'd try it again in a heartbeat if someone else was paying.

2018-07-12,Kristos T,"Last night for my husbands birthday, I surprised him with a visit at Vespertine, a conceptual restaurant full of creativity, art, and beauty in food, herbs, perfume, and  design. Like Noma outside of Copenhagen or El Bulli outside Barcelona, Vespertine is an incredible foodie heaven but warm, enveloping and creative. With gorgeous plates from Japan ( that I happen to collect as well) knowledgeable servers, handwritten birthday greetings from the Chef and a personal meeting with him, in a 3 story modern building in Los Angeles, surrounded by gardens. We enjoyed a feast for 4 hours full of the art of living, cooking, and being filled to our senses with delights. To dissect the food is futile ,  This is more than what we ate but rather how we were genuinely welcomed to have a unique experience without loosing the humanity in it.  Kahn truly invites the guest to a overall sensory experience. The dishes looked and tasted like the undeniable talent he inhabits. I can’t pinpoint to one specific part of the meal it was all amazing   The music seems to be a 528 herz drone throughout the night,very Brian Eno , calming and meditative ambient music .   We started sitting in the garden for the beginning and end of the evening, then moving on to meet the chef upstairs and see the kitchen, then entering the dining area of 8 tables, for  the joy of being inside a calm, peaceful work of art.  Mr.Kahn a friendly , young MC set the tone for the incredible lovely staff around us. It’s almost choreographed , the friendliness is real , the willingness to answer questions about the various plates where met with knowledgeable directions where to look in LA.  And it happens to be around the corner of Kahn’s other place “Destroyer” almost across from the restaurant  Over all my advice is bring all the culture you have , please dress up a little , I know it’s LA but I don’t need to see sandals for dinner..be open to experiment and stop comparing what and where you are already ate better or different.  You come here to be transported into a different state of mind and witness ( at least a culinary) evolution  I want to thank everyone again for all the kindness and care.

2018-07-09,Lauren D,"A number of years ago, we went to Alinea in Chicago. In our minds, no restaurant has succeeded in matching it.  So, having heard the chef/founder at Vespertine used to work at Alinea, we had high hopes. And, since a small bucket of money just happened to have dropped into my lap recently, we booked our anniversary dinner at Vespertine. You prepay for everything online, including gratuity, which is a fixed fee. I liked not having to deal with money once we were there. I wish more restaurants did that. We got the set tasting menu for $250 per person, with only one $200 wine pairing instead of two (and no after dinner drinks on the patio), so the total after taxes, fees and gratuity only came to $924 for the two of us (yes, ONLY). The personalized service was nice. Not only were we greeted by chef Jordan himself, but he also came by to personally explain the first few dishes to us when they were served. Not sure if everyone got that or if it was because we were the first to be seated that evening. Now our pros and cons. . .  PROS:  - Visually unforgettable, from the architecture to the interiors of the 3 dining spaces to the plates and serveware to the ikebana-like art that was each of our 18-20 dishes.  - Unique and delicious wines—and one beer-- that paired well with the very unique flavors of the dishes.  The pinot noir deserves an honorable mention, but my favorite was the sake that tasted like honeydew melon. - Knowledgeable and attentive wait staff, albeit a little unnatural in their demeanor (not their fault; I'm sure they are trained to be sort of monk-like) - Everything prepaid, so no need to deal with money during your dining experience.  CONS: - The other 5 senses were somewhat neglected in favor of the visual. I don't remember any dish having an amazing smell or surprising and delightful mouthfeel like some of the dishes we had at Alinea. - Having said that. . . You get an unattractive view of the outer world unless you're there after dark. We weren't. It was unfortunate, as the view of the industrial section of Culver City was a constant reminder that we were not, in fact, on another planet where everything was beautiful and surreal. - While the flavors in each dish were very unique, I would not use ""delicious"" to describe any of them. I found the turkey and the prawn to be the tastiest dishes, but not so great that I will find myself craving either of them. The chef's palate leans toward grassy, woodsy and bitter, and I did not feel that other flavors were represented in balance (particularly not spicy or ""umami""). - The seats are hard, cold, and ergonomically hellish (although beautiful). I kept asking for cushions to use as lumbar support, and while the attentive staff eagerly acquiesced, they had a hard time finding any extra cushions, another testament to just how much the other 4 senses were neglected in favor of the visual. - About 3 courses too many. We had the first table of the evening, arriving at 5:30. The experience (and this is without the optional after-dinner drinks on the patio) was 3 hours. . . in very uncomfortable seating. . .eating stuff that my stomach had no idea what to do with, so that my stomach was very bloated when I left. So was my husband's. BUT, I still give it 4/5 stars because we went there for a unique and memorable dining experience and that it definitely was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r594663591-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,4,en
2018-07-06,Renztem13,"If you have been looking to where the future of fine dining is going : look no further than Vespertine. As a fan of architecture and design and as someone who has  eaten at tasting restaurants across the world: the effort and passion and creativity that go into this experience have few equals.  That an entire building with seated garden and roof have been created just for this experience boggled the mind.  So you pay for dinner theater and at these prices that is what you get.  Best not to know too much other than to have an open mind and an empty stomach. I knew when Chef Jason had greeted each party we were in for something special.  We loved the pairing: especially the non alcoholic breaks between wines so we left with most of our senses intact. If you are reading this : you are a curious person so I would very much recommend it.  You do have to manage expectations.  There was such an exciting and auspicious start that when the majority of the courses do take place in the main dining room like many other tasting menu restaurants: many in our group were let down “waiting for what’s next”. Maybe that part I would have liked to have known in advanced. But now a month later as I  finally have a moment to write a review, few experiences are embedded into my psyche like this one.

2018-06-30,Mike K,"Push the envelope and try this unique, cutting edge dining experience. Hard to describe Vespertine because it’s so different from any other restaurant we’ve been to. But the service is impeccable, the food is wildly inventive and, more importantly, delicious, and the setting is of another world. Not the kind of place you take the family to every Friday night, but a must-try unique LA culinary gem. I’m generally not the type to photograph my food—I may never have done it before—but felt compelled to do it here. The courses were as beautiful as they were delicious.

2018-05-14,DanielKalen,"I had read all sorts of good and bad reviews for Vespertine, and they were all either radically good or radically bad. Nobody was just “oh, it’s an OK place”. I did notice most of the bad reviews were from soon after the opening, and in all honestly beginnings can be a bit tough, but it is a very good sign when reviews improve overtime, as was this case.  The restaurant is located somewhere south of Beverly Hills, in what felt like the outskirts of LA city itself but it’s difficult to tell because distances in LA are ridiculous, and the city has swallowed several other smaller cities around it so who knows.  The story is that the chef became obsessed with a building and had the architect build him this place to showcase his food. This would be an irrelevant piece of information for any other restaurant, but at Vespertine, they make sure you see the whole building while you dine, so be ready to stand and walk (at the request of the staff) in between courses.  Appetisers were served in a quiet lounge area on the highest floor of the building, accessible through an elevator to the main dining room and then an outdoor staircase. It’s a large loft area, very minimalist, with low lighting that set a nice relaxed mood. For the main courses we were escorted back to the main dining room, which was on the first or second floor. It’s a platform with tables and chairs set in semi-private nooks, suspended above the ground floor. Post-dinner tea and sweets were served in the cute little garden outside. The whole building had a delectable woody and spicy smell to it.  The plates were complex but well executed, very inventive and interestingly presented though some of the presentations did make eating the dishes a bit difficult (shapes of plates, for example). Overall, we found it to be an impressive meal, with great flavours and good ingredients, easily worth the high cost of the menu.  I would recommend to someone looking for more than just good food, and that doesn’t mind a bit (not much, just enough) of gimmick that does not detract at all from the food itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r580077127-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,5,en
2018-05-01,fivestarsd,"We agree that the food is quite remarkable and inventive. But we give 3 stars because of the wine pairing. When booking it says ""In addition to our wine list and glass offerings, we have three beverage pairings available"" which implies that this is a wine pairing. It is not. In addition to the occasional wine, the chef has concocted beverages sometimes containing wine but not always. Most of his concoctions did not work for us.  The chef has reinvented dishes (like the remarkable ""chip and dip"") and may want to reinvent the wine pairing but they strongly imply that the pairing is a wine pairing and they charge a lot for it so we expected some high end wines. When we complained they started giving us the wines that went with the ""complete pairing"" (we had chosen the ""lighter pairing"" since we don't need that much wine). We got Santa Barbara wines that were good but not great and they poured about 2 oz.  If you wish to experience this restaurant, do not choose the beverage pairing. Talk with the sommelier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32272-d12607469-r577141318-Vespertine-Culver_City_California.html,3,en

It was quite new for us to not see the menu, so we didn't know what to expect, but definitely the chef knows what he is doing! They gives us few surprise dishes, as well !!!

2022-10-10,MrsMardy,"I want to begin by giving a shout out to the two VERY hard woking servers at this restaurant.  They were fantastic.  They were also put in a very bad position the evening we were there.  We arrived at 7:30 per the request of the restaurant.  We left at midnight.  They offered a vegetarian menu.  My husband chose the regular menu.  The starters, all the same typical of France, were not vegetarian (which is OK for me), and they were OK. Fish, foie gras, etc.  But here is the disappointing part: next course for me: one mushroom, sliced in pieces and with a mushroom consommé.  My husband: squid noodles, cooked right there in front of us, pretty good.  Next course: Me: one...one small ravioli called an original ""French minestrone""-that was undercooked in a cold cabbage broth that tasted like nothing else but cabbage.  Now we are at 10:30pm in the evening.   The bread was dry and had been cut way before the meal.  My husband had pigeon, again, OK.  The rest?  I don't even remember. Again: the two servers, a young man and a young woman, were so kind and nice, got us a taxi (at midnight)...but what the heck?  Surely you can do better than this!  Don't offer a vegetarian menu if you can't support it.  I'm not a true vegetarian, but I can only imagine how upset I would be if I was...and really, over four hours for this food was not acceptable. It's not an easy restaurant to get to and expensive cab ride-40 E each way). I hated writing this because the servers were fantastic, but it was a bad experience due to the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r863984632-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,2,en

We were able to have one 5 course and one 7 Course menu, something many restaurants refuse but here,  everything was possible.   An excellent white wine from St. Emilion (!) was quite the discovery!

2019-04-14,Chris A,"We were recommended Le Prince Noir as we only had a night to stay near Bordeaux and wanted something special. It was certainly different! Having eaten at a number of Michelin star restaurants across the world, this one stood out for all the wrong reasons.  We booked for 8pm but arrived 15 minutes early to have a drink, to find the doors closed. It was cold evening, but the staff made us wait outside until 8pm, along with the other couple who had booked that evening. Not exactly a warm welcome!!  We chose the 6-course tasting menu which can be best described as ‘good in parts’. The dishes were experimental. Some were delicious (the Octopus) and some were really not pleasant at all (the white asparagus). There was no meat course, as this had been replaced by the white asparagus. I ate more than my wife as I found her passing many elements of each dish to me...  Service was good, although one member of staff’s  approach to service was a little off-hand. The lad who served us spoke excellent English and was genuinely welcoming and he offered us either pigeon or cheese when he realised that we did not like the white asparagus.  Le Prince Noir clearly has a very good reputation locally, so perhaps we went on a bad night. We’ll never know, because we won’t be booking there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r666400576-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,2,en

2018-11-01,Saviotung,We enjoyed the food very much and the price of this one star restaurant was very fair. Good value. I did not like the decor inside much.

2018-01-19,alanpcoleman,"What makes a good restaurant? The food obviously. Check. A real but warm welcome. Check. Excellent service that's attentive but not intrusive, friendly but not invasive, present but unseen. Check. A nice setting..... Hmmmmm a dark, rainy night doesn't help clarify that. An atmosphere you can relax in. Check.  Often a Michelin star can raise expectations. Having been deeply disappointed a few days before, I was a little nervous going here. I needn't have been. The staff were genuine, smiled and laughed, asked me about the food and wine, listening and taking my limited opinion into account. They were attentive but not overbearing. Eating alone doesn't bother me, I do however wonder if this doesn't sometimes put extra pressure on the staff. The atmosphere was lovely and the music excellent. They even turned up the volume a little for me... I was glad to be in the corner looking outwards as my back couldn't see others' reactions to my seated dancing.  The food was not perfect, some over salty, some a little bland. However these were parts of individual dishes and not the whole. I'd gladly return to the very smokey pork dish or the flavoursome scallops. The meal was extravagant in a good way, quality ingredients, well cooked, flavoursome, and at times adventurous. Sometimes too adventurous for my palate, but worthy of respect for trying, and mostly succeeding. The wine accompanying each dish working in harmony with the flavours on the plate. The food was a good 4*, the overall 5* easily coming from the staff, atmosphere, the 'feeling' engendered by the whole.  It's not an easy place to find (thank the GPS in the taxi), but it's worth the effort.

2017-10-24,David S,"We booked dinner at Le Prince Noir to celebrate our friends' wedding anniversary while on vacation in Bordeaux, and it was the perfect spot.  It is a short taxi ride outside of the heart of Bordeaux (across the river/estuary).  The setting is beautiful, and the restaurant a stunning mix of old (the castle) and new (the modern glass addition for the restaurant).  The food (we did the tasting menu) was exceptional, and the tables well-spaced; the restaurant was full, but we felt like we were eating alone.  One of our party is a vegetarian, which I had neglected to inform the restaurant of in advance (oops), and they did a wonderful job on no notice in creating a delicious and creative vegetarian meal.  The service was terrific, and the views of the surrounding grounds spectacular.

2017-07-26,moraira,"This restaurant is a one star Michelin place, and therefore serves good food, offers good service (and is expensive) . It lived up to the expectation  In the evening they just offer their two tasting menus, one of 5 courses and one of eight courses. We chose the 5 course menu and found even that was almost more than we could eat.  The setting is breath-taking - but you do need to have a table in the half of the restaurant with the picture windows. Ask to be seated there when you reserve. We had a view over the château, and as night fell, the château was floodlit  The staff are very good, friendly and polite, without being over friendly nor obsequious.. Personally I found their uniform a bit odd, the men in jeans and white trainers, and the girls in red dresses and white trainers  The menu changes weekly, so you are unlikely to have what we had, but take it from me, the flavour, quality and presentation of the food is outstanding.. We had a bottle of wine , rather than the selection of different wines you can have with each course. For a Michelin star restaurant, the wines are reasonably priced  It was a bit difficult to find, my GPS did not have the street given in their address. I put in a neighbouring street, and that got me to close enough, where we were able to pick up the street location signs for it. Once you get to it, there is ample parking, and you just walk into  the château via the marked signs  All in all a wonderful evening",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644083-d1197354-r505795555-Restaurant_le_Prince_Noir-Lormont_Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,5,en

2017-07-13,traveling4mama,"Three generations of our family were given a wonderful experience at Restaurant Le Prince Noir.  I have been been fortunate enough to dine at many places where the food is delicious, but the staff and service is what sets Le Prince Noir in a class of its own.  There are a few points that stand out for me:  Decor: you walk in and there is beautiful artwork all around.  Everything in the restaurant has been chosen with care from the foosball table/bread cutting board, to the vintage Nintendo Game Machine in the corner (complete with sofas so you can actually play!)  Child-friendly:seeing my three year old and six year old go into the kitchen to order their meal with Vivien Durand is a sight I will remember for a long time.  The children's meal was delicious, healthy, and they ate every single bite.  I was so happy to see my children exposed to such a meticulously prepared meal. In between courses, my children were happily playing in the sculpture garden behind and no one even blinked an eye at children running around.  Servers:the servers were knowledgable, friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  They made great recommendations with the food and wine pairings.    The FOOD: Each bite was a delight and I was sad when I was too full to eat more.  Each dish was carefully and exquisitely prepared.

The ambiance is wonderful, perfect both for romantic dinners as well as larger celebrations. The restaurant's interior is a nice mix of modern and natural. The overall view is modern with lots of little details that I loved, like the big wooden table on which we were where we were served in stone like dishes with modern shapes. Each dish having its own identity. We were comfortably seated at our table and the waiter presented us with a smile the restaurant and prepared us for our 8 course discovery menu. I loved the team at the Prince Noir, it was a pleasure to be served by people who adore what they are doing.  We were guided by the restaurant's team into an explosion of tastes and aromas. All dishes were beautifully presented and coupled with a perfectly selected glass of wine. I was wonderfully surprised by the taste of so many dishes in our menu. The Chef has managed to bring out the taste of every product and garnish it in a way to bring out the best of it. I loved all dishes. The cooking techniques and mix of ingredients and products was in perfect balance.
