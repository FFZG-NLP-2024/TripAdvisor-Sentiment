2024-09-20,SCagray,"This was by far our best meal in Slovenia (thus far). It was a cold, blustery night so everyone was indoors. We were seated in the little cabin area and it was cozy and warm. The entire place was full of patrons and the team handled it very well. They managed to stay attentive and we had our wine in hand and order in rather quickly.  The food was splendid. We had the house salad which was delicious and unique. We had the Sicilian potatoes, so very good. Potatoes cooked perfectly. Then polenta raddichio mushroom dish was the topper. The flavors blended perfectly. Heaven. The mushroom soup was just ok.   Highly recommend this place. We wished we could have gone back a second night but they were closed on Wed. Well deserved night off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r970645882-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,5,en

2024-08-28,Marco H,"Passing through Kranjska Gora, I am advised by the Accommodation Manager to go to this restaurant. What about: the environment is great both indoors and outdoors, the waiters are focused, fast and professional. The menu is very varied with a predilection for grilling, we order a grilled meat for 2 and we get a wooden board of one meter full of fat and vegetables, a spectacle. The dish was for 3 but also 4 people would eat there, my son took the BBQ ribs and came a strip of 40cm, huge. Beers of many kinds, excellent final coffee kill (Slivovitz) and adequate price.

2024-03-18,prusnjak,"The place is already pretty famous and wellknown to us, so we decided to visit it again and have a lunch overthere. Since the Winter is already over, or should I say, Winter didn¬¥t even arrive, the place is somehow incomplete and we missed the real feel.  We were pretty hungry, so we ordered roasted veal and pork under the bell for the three of us and one wiener schnittzel. We had a glass of some good craft beer and waited for the food to come for some 20 minutes. The guy which served us was really eager, kind, polite and willing to help. So the food finally arrived and looked OK on that big wooden plate. Also smelled good. We started and within just a few minutes our bellies were well filled. So, everything was well prepared, but every piece of meat was unfortunately missing something. I mean, all four of us commented that the meat was missing a bit of salt and other seasoning like grounded pepper, garlic etc... There was also one piece of meat which did not belonged here, because it was too lean and dry, so the seasoning and cooking technique did not do the thing, as it should. All in all, we had quite a good time, we did not finish the food, because the portions are too big, even for us hungry ""wolves"". The price for what we had is more than OK too. So the bottom line, we will give grade to the Kekec guys 4 of 5. It is good, but can be more than good with just a few extra kicks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274870-d10628042-r942782199-Okrepcevalnica_Lacni_Kekec-Kranjska_Gora_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,4,en

On Saturday evening when we arrived for the night we were in the hotel which is a very well maintained architectural building of character. The private Chanoine room where we slept was comfortable, very good bedding and tasteful decoration.  The staff is quality, and intentional through their service and remains attentive and available with a breakfast which brightened our morning nothing to complain about just thank them.  Saturday evening: let's talk about the restaurant La Ferme du Chapouton, in continuation of the service received by the hotel the welcome was impeccable as well as the service, but let's talk about the culinary part being a fine gastronomic critic I discovered a culinary journey including the emotions still remain anchored on my taste buds hats off to the cooked.  On Sunday lunchtime we went to the winegrowers' caf√©, this summer I find nice but a little more in a classic standard than the rest of the previous services even if we were well received and well eaten and a good wine tasting but that does not correspond no personal opinion on the services received in the two descriptions above concerning the hotel and the restaurant of the Chapouton farm.

2023-09-24,Eric V,"We had booked a suite in one of the houses and stayed in the main house in a superb suite. Fruit and water on arrival in the impeccably clean and tastefully decorated room. Possibility to unload your luggage and then park the car in private parking. Evening room service. Swimming pools a little far from the hotel. Nice natural swimming pool but too many mosquitoes with pretty gardens. Swimming pool dubresyaurznt heated but quite cramped. Towels available. Fresh fruit every day in the room. The only downside would be the breakfast charged at 25 euros which does not offer fried eggs but only scrambled eggs. That's a bit of an exaggeration. Very pleasant and attentive staff Very nice hotel at a high price, pleasant for 2 to 3 days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g445033-d482084-r918196311-Le_Clair_de_la_Plume-Grignan_Drome_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,4,en
