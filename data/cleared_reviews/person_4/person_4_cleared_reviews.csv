Set menu is enjoyed inside. It has 5 courses, but it's an understatement since there are 16 dishes listed in the menu.  There is a lobby upstairs you can have coffee and petit fours. Both food and service were very good. It was quite hot in the dining room but not unbearable. Chef came to discuss with all the guests afterwards. Ambience was relaxed and joyful. Really nice place, true 3 star!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r959943455-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en
2022-12-15,martin w,"The welcoming at a beautiful location was amazing. I had a great glass of champagne in a cozy room. The dinner was served in a different room, where a movable heater had to be installed and the cold breeze had to be stopped. While aranging all of this, I had an interesting tour of the wine cellar. All fine...it is a very old building. They serve mainly local and seasonal food, which I very much appriciate. I selected a five course dinner, which started with four different starters, of which all of them were on the very sour side. The individual taste of each ingredients was noticeable on the tongue and palate for a very short time, if at all ...the only thing which lasted was the sour taste....till the next course....same again.. The main courses were ok, but far away from what I would call 3 michelin star quality. On all tables, next to me, people were eating a lot of bread offered aside.... if I write a lot ... real a lot. It seemed to be good, but thoughts are left behind! The service was impeccable. Andreas Caminada seems to be to busy to take care of his core business. Sorry, I am looking forward to eating real great wonders of food.. somewhere else... very high expectations ... but no match.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r871823304-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,4,en
2022-11-15,oneforkatatime,"Came for dinner with high expectations as one of our party had been several times before and had fond memories. Incredible amuse-bouches served during the aperitif, each one more fun and enjoyable than the next which set us up for the dinner with great expectations. Then the dinner, great great food and so pretty too. However, wine waiter or sommelier, as was not clear, got the wine wrong twice. Service good but totally mechanical. When the chef came to the table at the end it reflected the service, seemed a chore rather than a pleasure, better not to come at that point. Overall felt more of a factory line which took away from the amazing food. Stayed overnight too and rooms very nice indeed but charging CHF 4 for a small bottle of hand sanitizer seemed bizarre for a CHF 600 / night  room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r868539901-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,3,en

2021-07-27,Gabriel_H61,"After several months from the reservation we finally arrived at Schloss Schauenstein.  Already the arrival from the parking slot gives a very nice view on the castle.  The multilingual welcome (we talked italian, english and german..) was very nice and the aperitif on the terrace brought the first interesting and tasting surprises.   We took the full menu (5 course) with accompanying wines (the men) and non alcoholic menu (the ladies). Also an interesting and unique proposal. The wines proposed were very unique and also an interesting discovery.  The quality, variety, fantasy in each plate was extraordinary from the beginning to the end. The rhytm between each plate perfect as also the service.  Last but not least, toward the end, Andreas Caminada came to our table and we had a nice conversation with some jokes.

Everything excels here from the first Amuse Bouche throughout the meal.  The great new addition that we enjoyed two days later is the newly opened restaurant Oz next door - also part of the Caminada set-up.. A dozen of vegetables based courses, all dramatically fresh and in a thoughtful Progression in a Counter setting was a great additional experience. Don’t miss it - currently you can get reservations on a couple of weeks notice we were told (rather than months for Schauenstein).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r799823351-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en
2021-05-20,#rooftopfoodie,"A meal at Andreas Caminada’s flagship, triple started Schauenstein castle restaurant is for most of us a once in a lifetime experience but a truly perfect and unforgettable one. The experience starts with very moody, spot lights-lit tables and just the best restaurant staff I have ever come across. Guests are treated with wonderful attention, just as one would expect in perfection obsessed Switzerland.  The dishes are an homage to the area but put together with amazing creativity. The sweetbread surprise dish was just perfect. And when the steaming bread arrives with the sea salt butter, it’s culinary heaven. The wine pairings have certainly been given much and thorough thought but cold-served red wine might not be to every wine lover’s taste. But a new option is readily made available following every whim of the guests.  The meal certainly doesn’t come cheap but combined with the perfect experience provided, it is surely worth every penny and more.

2020-01-18,DvA,"Andreas Caminada is Switzerland's most famous chef, so of course we had heard a lot about his restaurant before we finally made it up to a remote little village in Grison for an extended lunch at Schloss Schauenstein. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We were overwhelmed by the quality and the creativeness of the food, even before we got to the first main course. Caminada starts his menu with plenty of outstanding amuse bouches and appetisers before serving several larger courses. He refrains from using posh ingredients like caviar, wagyu beef or foie gras. Instead, all the dishes are inspired by local produce and recipes. Nevertheless, the combinations of flavours are just heavenly. And on top of it, each plate looks like a wonderful piece of art. The cheese course is another highlight: next to an exclusive selection of Swiss and French cheese, a broad range of side dishes makes for an unmatched variety of exciting flavours to finish off the savoury part of the meal. Of course, there are several sweet courses too. The best of which, in our case, was an extremely fluffy and delicate milk soufflé. The staff is young, and maybe a bit insecure, but this hardly harms the overall experience. At the end of the visit, coffee, digestives and petit fours are served in an upstairs room of the ancient chateau. As the sun sets behind the Grisons mountains, you have all the time in the world to become aware of the breathtaking excellence in cuisine and hospitality you have just enjoyed. This is a restaurant experience second to none in Switzerland!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r739827077-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

The rooms are marvelous and the whole area of the property is very nice.   The food was top notch, alltough i must say that if i only had to judge the food without the surroundings like service, ambiance, location, etc, i would feel that it was a tad overpriced as i had comparable/equal quality menus for a lot less.   Nevertheless, we got to meet and chat with the chef, an amazing and very charismatic person, which even had his sous-chef give us a tour of the kitchen.

2020-01-09,Joe_Black72,"I know... I promised in my past reviews I wouldn't have visited any more 3 Michelin star restaurants... But I did it again.   And result was the same.  3 Michelin stars -and Michelin star rates restaurants in general- are the most impersonal restaurants I know. No character,  no passion,  it seems they cook to get 3 stars.  In the old days instead,  you got 3 stars because you cooked.  Anyway....   Amazing location in one of the best cantons of Switzerland. Very nice atmosphere and very private dining rooms.  Chef Caminada may be a great food engineer,  no doubt about that,  but what he is totally missing in my view is the connection to the territory.   We are in a Canton full of great mountains... So why the hell do I need to feel Asian influence in my plates?  I wanna fell the mountains and its smell.  If I want to feel Asian I would go to an Asian restaurant!   The endless pre entrees tastings were just too much.  And, again,  this is a new fashion -probably requested by Michelin so that you can get stars-,  which never existed in the older days where the heavyweight was food and not its design.   I can't tenner any main dish I would order again.  But for sure I thought twice I was somewhere between Vietnam and Cambodia,  and not in fantastic Graubuenden.   Sweets were not amazing at all,  although perfect from the outside.   Wine list honestly disappointing. Even more disappointing was that I asked something to the Sommelier and he couldn't answer -and me,  I'm not a professor at all...  I just know a few things about wines!.   Even more disappointing was the cheese dish.  I asked only one thing to the cheese dish waiter and,  again,  he couldn't answer.  And my question was SO basic!  I couldn't believe it.   These 2 people,  with all due respect,  shouldn't be working at a 3 stars restaurant!  This shows exactly today's attitude.  Great plates,  great designs,  amazing engineering in the food...  And no substance behind that. No passion.  No heart.    As much as I like you,  dear chef Caminada, you won't see me back unless you so profound changes to your kitchen...  You may loose some stars if you do that,  but you may make many more clients happy and become special also without stars.

Service is exceptional.  The wine pairing was terrible. The sparkling wine and white burgandy were lovely. The local wines were awful. I appreciate the vision of supporting local vineyards, but with this level of food, you need world class wines!   Order a bottle instead!

2019-10-05,Yuan Y,"Schloss Schauenstein is an institution in Switzerland: most people have to book (and maybe even save) several months in advance, many come to celebrate a special occasion, and most people who dine here probably also regularly visit other fine dining establishments... so the expectations are very high.  We came for lunch - which is what we would recommend, as the entire meal lasted 5.5 hours, and we didn't eat for 16 hours afterwards. We've ordered the 6 courses meal, and my friend also ordered the wine pairing. As expected, the food was world class. Andrea Caminada, clearly, is a culinary artist. Excellent produce, stunning presentation, beautiful flavors. We especially loved the langoustine which was one of the best dishes I have eaten in my life. You get a huge selection of snacks and amuse-bouches before the starters, and I loved the small booklet to take home which included our menu as well as some seeds to plant at home.   When you dine in a restaurant like Schloss Schauenstein, the service needs to be on a par with the food as it shapes your entire experience... you might not remember most of the dishes that you ate, but you will always remember how you felt when you were at the restaurant. In this regard, unfortunately, our expectations were not met.   - The restaurant offers a free pick-up from Thusis which is very nice. We were warmly welcomed by a cheerful young lady who knew our names and immediately made us feel like we were old friends.   - Schloss Schauenstein is a beautiful little castle, and all the surroundings are also very charming. We took our apéro with the first snacks on the pretty terrace, this is where we met our main server who didn't seem to like us very much. One of the various small snacks was a ""foie gras bonbon"" but because I had mentioned in advance that I don't like foie gras, I got a little tartlet as an alternative. My friend whispered to me that she had forgotten to mention that she doesn't like liver, so I asked the server if he could bring another tartlet, and the response was: ""The tartlet is the alternative for the person who had mentioned in advance that she does not eat foie gras."" (???) We did not get another tartlet, so I told her to eat mine.   - We only had 3 tables in our room with 4 other people, and we counted 8 servers in total. Most of them were very friendly and nice, except the aforementioned gentleman who was professional but we could tell that he did not warm up to us. Unfortunately, I didn't ask for his name so let's just call him ""Mr. X"" for this review.   - My friend got her first glass of wine and immediately said ""I can mostly smell dishwashing detergent"". She didn't say anything but when it happed again with the third glass of wine, she mentioned it and immediately got a new glass, but the waiter said that they had had the problem before and had tried various solutions... to no avail. If you have had this problem before, I just wonder why servers don't ""check"" glasses before pouring guests wine? At a restaurant of this calibre, you simply can't have glasses smelling of dishwashing detergent!   - Mr. X didn't seem very well-informed with regards to the wines. He would e.g. confuse Spanish and Italian wines, even though he was looking at the bottles when he introduced them.   - We absolutely loved the cheese course which came with various delicious snacks (cured meats, Maluns, a gorgeous panforte, tiny potatoes etc.). A lovely lady explained the different cheeses and put together a little selection for each one of us. At the end, she said that she'd be happy to come back if we'd like another piece of one of the cheeses. Because we loved the cheeses, we did want a little more cheese after we had finished. When we asked Mr. X, he was clearly not amused and told us, that the cheese cart was already gone but if we told him EXACTLY which cheese we wanted, he could MAYBE get us another small piece. I didn't remember the names of the cheeses that I wanted and because he seemed irritated, we just asked for the only one where we could remember details. At this point, our happy mood had vanished, because we felt like a nuisance.    - Our neighbors couldn't finish their bread and asked to take it home with them. The waiters brought out a new bread in a nice box for them (very nice gesture), and when I saw that, I said (more as a joke) ""ohhh, I want one too!"". Mr. X then looked at me with indignation and said ""SERIOUSLY?"".   - At one point, Mr. Caminada himself came out to say ""hello"". He was very professional but also seemed very reserved, it didn't feel like he enjoyed the interaction with the guests, and it was more of an obligation. Our neighbors celebrated their 22nd anniversary and had eaten at Schloss Schauenstein several times in the past. I would expect a Michelin*** restaurant to do something special for such an occasion, and I would expect the chef to know... but he didn't. The couple had to mention to him that they were here for their anniversary, Mr. Caminada said ""oh, congratulations"" and directly moved on to the next table.    - We went back to the terrace for our coffee/tea and the petit fours (beautiful!). I wanted to order a jasmine tea (which is not a very unusual tea choice), and Mr. X told me that they didn't have it, because ""nobody else orders it"". Slightly disappointing as I'm a tea sommelier and would expect at least the most common tea choices in a restaurant like this. We chatted with the lovely couple next to us (who were celebrating their anniversary), and they told us that they had ordered 3 courses for CHF 216 + an extra foie gras starter. What they didn't know, and what nobody told them, was, that the foie gras starter was CHF 95.- extra = they ended up paying CHF 311 for 4 courses, when the 6 courses meal was only CHF 270.   All in all, our experience confirmed why Andreas Caminada is one of the best chefs in the country: All his accolades are well-deserved, and the food was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the service was not. When I pay this kind of price for a meal, I expect the staff to go the extra mile to ensure that I have a fabulous experience, and I want them to HAPPILY bring me whatever I want. I want the same attention to detail which has been poured into all of the dishes which we ate that day. It's just such a pity that so many people work hard to create an experience for the guests but at the end of the day, you will mostly remember the weakest link...   We went to IGNIV the next day and had a better time there: While the food was in our opinion on a similar level, the service was so much warmer, and we felt truly taken care of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r715578014-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,4,en
2019-09-22,travelin_tommy,"My wife and I had a wonderful, but costly, experience dining here. The service was impeccable. The ambience was terrific, sitting on the terrace for apperitivi and snacks and later for coffee and dessert, as well as inside for our lengthy meal (since we chose to have multiple dishes from the menu rather than choose a la carte). There were multiple samples of amuse bouche as well as desserts served with the coffee, not counting the multiple different dishes on the menu. Frankly, we did not have any that we thought were less than very good, many were excellent, and also many were surprising in taste combinations we had not previously had nor considered. We have eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants; sometimes we have questioned their stars, but not the three stars awarded here. My only quibble was with the drinks: everything was very expensive. Wine on their selected list to compliment the meal was good but not really exceptional. Furthermore, comparing the price of two wines with which I was familiar on the list of their wines showed a mark-up of >3 times the price easily available elsewhere. My guess is that they make their profit on the wines to pay for the excellent service and food preparation that we experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r711964898-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

2019-07-19,Kellytx78,"My husband and I knew we wanted to take a fabulous trip to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had no idea where we wanted to go though. We love tasting menus so he did some research (shocking!!) and he discovered this amazing hotel & restaurant. We booked our entire trip around this hotel and restaurant. It was definitely worth it. We booked a night at the hotel in the castle and had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived to the train station in Thusis, we had a really kind woman (I can't remember her name though..) pick us up in an Audi A8 which of course my husband loved. She drove us to the castle and the minute we pulled up, I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew from the pictures that it was going to be incredible, but pictures don't do it justice. It is GORGEOUS! The grounds, the flowers, the castle...everything is picture perfect. Check in was super easy and she gave us a tour of the property so we knew where everything was. There are so many adorable little nooks and places on the property for various activities. I won't like - there were so many that I forgot them all! We went to the pool area for awhile, went to the beautiful lawn across from the castle, went to the terrace, went to another outdoor terrace for a few drinks....it was all just perfect. It was so quaint and beautiful, yet really welcoming which was nice. When we got back to our room (we stayed in the Kastanie which has low ceilings, just FYI if you are traveling with anyone tall) and got settled in. The room is so charming. We loved it. Staying in the hotel was the perfect setting too. Anyway, we got a knock on our door while I was getting dressed in the bathroom, but it was the chef's wife! She explained there was a little issue with another hotel guest and the guest needed a special room to accommodate a health concern. My husband and I were happy to move rooms, so we packed our stuff and headed downstairs to the lobby. On our way down, we passed Marco (more about him later) and he was determined to carry our luggage for us, but my husband refused to let him. He was so kind and really wanted to carry it, but my husband is stubborn. Ha! Anyway, we ran into Sarah and Enna (I think that was how it's spelled) on the stairs. Enna oversees the dinner service I believe. They explained that the guest had solved their issue by switching with another couple they were with so we didn't have to change rooms after all. Sarah was soooo apologetic and kind, and we could tell she felt really bad about us packing our stuff. We really didn't mind though and we told her it was completely fine. I joked with her and told her I just wanted to meet her husband because I had researched the restaurant and the hotel and was seriously fascinated and inspired by him. She said she'd gladly tell him to come meet us during dinner. Needless to say, I was really excited. We got dressed, and headed to one of the loveliest rooms for the Apertif. Words can't explain the beauty of this room. The ceiling detail was stunning and so beautiful. The walls were painted with these gorgeous paintings. I can't even describe it because it's simply stunning, but in a very charming and welcoming way. My favorite colors are pink and green and there were accents of them in the room, which also was just so pretty! They seated us at a small table and greeted us with a glass of complimentary champagne from Sarah. It was really nice of them. They also took our picture for our anniversary which was a perfect momento from our evening. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I won't go into detail, but the dinner was AMAZING. It was absolutely the most exquisite dinner we've ever had. It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. Marco was one of our main servers and he was the best. He was funny, charming, so kind and really made our experience an even better one. All of the service team was very nice. He and Alexander were the ones who really made the best impression because they were so friendly. We are from Texas and like to talk so they were really nice to talk to us. I could tell they read their diners really well because a few other diners didn't seem as chatty as we were and they weren't as chatty with them. Anyway, they were great. Towards the end of our dinner, Chef Andreas came to our table and talked to us. He was so friendly and it was surreal. I'd read so much about him so the fact that he comes and introduces himself and thanked us was so impactful. He greeted all the tables, but I asked him if I could take a picture with him and he said he'd be happy to. We went to the lobby, snapped a pic and mentioned to him that it would be great if he was around the next day so we could get a picture of him with something we'd brought (something from my husband's job which wouldn't make sense unless you're from Texas). He said he'd be around in the morning and to let the front desk know when we were available. We said bye, got a cocktail to go and walked outside to the terrace to look at the beautiful grounds again. They're illuminated at night and it's like a fairy tale. The next day, we went to breakfast (which was soooo good. The croissants are the best I've ever had) and then we strolled around again and decided to stop at the Casa Caminada (his newest hotel property on the grounds which is a little more casual). It was really cool and obviously didn't have the history of the castle, but it was really beautiful, yet trendy, yet classic. Hard to explain. The floors are awesome though. Anyway, there is a bakery in there and a coffee area in the restaurant so we got a cup of coffee and went to sit outside. We had mentioned to the front desk that if Sarah or the Chef was around and available, that'd be great, but no worries if not. We didn't really think they'd come by, but about 5 minutes later, they did! We chatted for a bit, took another picture and Chef went to go about his day, but Sarah talked to us for a while. She is wonderful. If you get a chance to meet her, definitely do because she's one of the kindest women I've ever met. She and I had a lot in common because of kids, etc. so it was really nice talking to her and learning more about the hotels and IGNIV. If you don't know about it, look it up for sure.  After a lovely chat with her, it was time for us to go back to the train station. I was so so sad to leave because it was just incredible, but it was the PERFECT anniversary in the perfect location. It's breathtaking and the food can't even be put into words. Simply put - if you're planning a trip to Switzerland, you MUST stay at this castle and dine at the restaurant. If you aren't planning a trip, do it because you won't regret it and you'll make memories that will last a lifetime. They made such a great impression on us and we absolutely cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r690892599-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en

Hardly ever have I enjoyed a lunch lasting over 4:30hrs and wished for more.  Hint: if it’s warm/sunny, try having the aperitif on the terrace, even better on the tower.

2019-02-13,MarinMarais,"I was really looking forward to dinner at Schloss Schauenstein and in the end, it was mostly what could be expected from an evening at a star restaurant. Attentive and knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, high level of complexity in courses and an interesting wine pairing. The most disappointing course was the cheese which I found unremarkable in taste and in which I believe made my stomach sour at the end of the evening. I could appreciate the time and care that goes into creating, preparing and serving a multitude of complexities on a dish, but in the end, it’s a long evening (from 19.00-almost 23.30 when we finally finished dessert in the main dining room) of hodgepodge different courses that don’t necessarily go together or complement each other. I was looking for more harmony in what was presented. I’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, this was the first 3* and I would hope that 3* and the prices that go with it would warrant something especially creative or special but it wasn’t my opinion of the evening at the Schloss. Everything was executed to an extremely high standard but it just failed the wow factor for me, it was just lacking soul. I left thinking that the price wasn’t worth the evening. It’s a pure question of taste, of course, as the quality is definitely there, but for me it was just a technically ambitious variety show of amouse bouche, tasting dishes and desserts. The expectations for a 3* restaurant are probably unreasonable, but I think the main reason people are drawn to these restaurants is to leave feeling inspired in one way or another by the chef’s creativity.  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I suspect that Caminada’s taste is perhaps just not my taste, and that’s ok, because it seems he impresses and inspires more than enough people!

2019-01-20,i-love-zermatt,"Phenomenal atmosphere, absolutely outstanding food creations, great Infrastrcture, Andreas Caminada is a genius in his own way. So, yes, visiting Schloss Schauenstein is a MUST. The “but”, though is related to the staff. It doesn’t help if two of them are superb, when others are bringing the experience down, rolling eyes, not standing to their commitments or simply being unfriendly.

2018-12-09,HansM,"Of course, it is an expensive place to go to - but still, it is great value for money - and the wines are have better prices than in many less exclusive restaurants! For me, a restaurant has to satisfy me in three dimensions: Food - Ambiance - Staff and Andreas Caminada and his team make sure that all these dimensions are taken care of. You really feel welcome and at home, there are no stiff upper lips or french-style waiter snobbishness, everything goes easy but, as you can expect, is highly professional. This time round, we were very happy with the food which had the seasonal touch of fall-winter, but was still colorful and presented a happy contrast to the weather outside. Leave room for the cheese board which is full of excellent specialties from the region and even comes with some small blue local potatoes. Ms Junge does an excellent job with the wines. And last but not least, this is the restaurant where the chef shows presence, bids farewell to the guests. Overall, again a great experience.

Most striking of the restaurant is the relaxed atmosphere. We took our time browsing through the menu an the extensive wine menu. We asked many questions, but never did we detect any impatience.  As can be expected, all amuses and courses are excellent. Tastes are superior and most dishes have a nice ‘bite’. This is something we sometimes miss in restaurants in this league.

2018-08-02,malli42,"As mentioned in my other tripadvisor comments, this year we chose Andreas Caminada and the restaurant Schauenstein as our yearly 3* experience.   And also in a nutshell, overwhelming. This comments reflects also the hotel experience... from the first contact up to the last view there is absolutely nothing to complain about.   Hotel: We stayed in the room ""Wasser"", which is a double room located at the top of the main building. As we arrived pretty early a very nice host showed us everything and explained all facilities and possibilities. You have to imagine, that this is a relatively small castle, but there are hints and secret corners to relax, to sunbath, to crab some food & wine - simply to enjoy. Many thanks to the complete staff. But if you are interested to stay here, please have a closer look before choosing a room. In our room the shower was a bathtub in the middle of the room, the toilet was separated with translucent glass. Actually we liked it.   Restaurant: As many others wrote, marvellous. The weather was great, so we started with the aperitif and small snacks on the beautiful terrace. Here we also enjoyed the last glass of wine and petit fours after the marvellous dinner. Between these two delicacies we were faced a incredible genius menu, based only on local food (and it is incredible what is possible with this local stuff). Ok, two courses were weak compared to the others. But this is highly depend on personal taste. Last but not least not to forget the highly professional - but always with a twinkle in their eyes - staff.

At the set time of dinner we walked the short distance to the restaurant and were warmly greeted outside by the owner and chef - what a nice welcome. The menu for the dinner was set, so we only had to choose wine. However, here was the only less positive point of the experience, as the prices on the wine card were unreasonable high (cost to qualify), So we opted for the wine pairing, which I usually don’t do - this was actually quite fine. The food came in a good pace in many small servings - all presented in beautiful pottery and even more importantly with great taste. Some of the dished was served outside by the fire. During the evening we were taken exceptionally well care of by the team - they are just so attentive and enthusiastic.

Oh boy the food... AMAZING and almost impossible to describe. Like trying to describe a midsummer sundown to a blind man.  15 courses of utter sensory perfection created by the wizard chef Nicolai Tram. No shortcuts, No limits, 100% local. 1000% delicious and astonishing looking dishes.  From the moose tartar with pike roe - to cured pikeperch jaws smoked on juniper berry branches... I was left with goosebumps several times and my jaw dropped to many times i looked like a fish out of water.  Paired with wonderful wines and non alcoholic curiosity’s by sommelier Eva Helbæk Tram. Mind blowing and inspiring. Fireweed flower made into a sparkling dream!!   Guys this has to go on your bucket list!!

This one was really too big and not our favourite. Unfortunately, my table companion did not feel well, no, that was not due to the food, so we ended the evening early.

2022-09-15,Candi,"Prior to visiting Andreu Genestra, we were excited to try the tasting menu and the hyper-locally produced dishes.   However, our expectations weren't met. The restaurant's head server was far from obliging, which is rare in a Michelin-rated restaurant. We've never experienced such arrogance or inability to be flexible whatsoever. We almost left before ordering, which we deeply regret not doing.   Since we saw the sommelier greeting tables with such positivity, we ordered the wine pairing but were disappointed when our table didn't receive the same treatment and attention as others nearby.   While the dishes on the tasting menu were stunningly presented, they lacked flavor and inspiration with some dishes relying on a heavy dose of salt as the main seasoning. During the service, we felt that the pacing between menu items was hurried and didn't give us time to enjoy the outside atmosphere.

We took the signature menu and there were some courses which were excellent but some others were not to the level as you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant.   The waiters were very nice but they could not explain all dishes which is again a bit weird in such so-called top-notch restaurant.

Naturally we were really rooting for their prized Michelin starred dining, but unfortunately it feel slightly short basis our experience of these calibre restaurants. Regrettably, I agree with other reviewers there are courses within the tasting menu that are hit and miss, and at times real flavour and spark is missing. Off the sensations menu the homemade olive oil and tapenade was just wonderful, but while the peanut course was bereft of any punch or flavour. The only true Michelin style standard came with the rice/foie based course which was rich and intense but poorly followed by a mushy Ray(didn’t feel fresh), and a very bland suckling pig - the cracking was flavourless. To be clear the staff were fantastic and knowledgable over the whole evening, and I really enjoyed the wine pairings - the tarragona fortified wine with the cheese was superb. I worry that maybe a bit of complacency is creeping in, and perhaps a bit of reinvention is needed to get it back to the gastronomic standard Andreu Genestre must wield.

2021-06-30,Hobbitu,"It was quite a mixed bag. Some very interesting flavors and combinations. But mostly pushing the experimental aspect too far and missing out on a solid, delicious basis. There are no dishes from the sensations tasting menu we would love to have for a main another day. The modern interpretation of Crêpe Suzette at the end and the olive oil course in the beginning were probably the best.  Unfortunately there were some „mistakes“ for a star rated restaurant. We asked, for example, to slow down the pace after delivering first few courses literally plate after plate. They did that for one course and went immediately back to the super fast pace afterwards. Or we were alcohol free the whole night (not by choice!) and got juice pairing but got served a brandy as part of the dessert without even been asked or offered an alcohol free alternative. Lastly, the portion size was just too big (in particular the aubergine and rice dish) and we asked them to cut half the portions and to share the desserts. The former ended up in a not so nicely, literally pulled off some parts of the main component.  The location appears beautiful at first sight but is mediocre at the best. It’s lacking style and interior design. The garden lounge where you get drinks before dinner was not well maintained and felt improvised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r794966578-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,4,en
2021-05-29,Na Turel,I just had dinner at Andreu Genesta’s restaurant. The experience was sublime. I believe their sommelier Dani is the best sommelier I ever encountered. And I met a few. Dani asked was our taste was. He listened and understood. He offered us splendid and unchartered wines - totally in line with our expectations.

2020-08-31,JeremyS1_10,"A triumph of style over content. The presentation was great but the food itself failed to live up to the excitement of the build up. It is tiring and dull to be given a lecture before every course about what you are about to eat . Like conceptual art that only makes sense when someone explains it to you first. It would be better if the food were allowed to speak for itself. But it would also help if the staff did not speak like automatons programmed to give the same explanation of every dish - but not as if they meant it - to be fair it is hard to be expressive when you are wearing a mask.

It was experimental and new-thinking and pushed our boundaries, creating an unforgettable experience which is exactly what we expect from a Michelin star restaurant. The techniques were sophisticated and the ingredients just delicious.  The surroundings were just gorgeous and the staff so attentive and kind, also to the children. They even accomodated that our daughter is a pescetarian with no problem at all.

2020-07-31,KJ Percy,"Let me start my saying that we don’t often frequent these types of restaurants but it was a special occasion and we wanted to do something different. We enjoyed many of the courses and in particular the earlier ones of oil, fruit soup (pictured), veggie terrine and falafel, but the later courses were not for us (tuna, prawn, puddings). The cheese plate was gorgeous though. Also we didn’t expect so much food and length of time (again probably our inexperience). It was 4 hours and portions were larger than you would expect (in my view) for 9 courses PLUS amous Bouche and petit fours.

2020-07-24,Zillah,"As l promised in my last review of the Predi Son Jaumell Hotel Rural, l will now be featuring our experience in the one Michelin Star restaurant which belongs to the maestro chef, Andreu Genestra. The restaurant is made up of inner and outside dining areas. We have dined in both and had equally nice experiences. The layout is quite simple, but pleasant. I actually prefer the outside restaurant as it overlooks the beautiful gardens with their spacious lounging areas. The view at sunset is simply spectacular.  Apart from the exquisite meals one is bound to experiences here, Andreu Genestra’s choice of various types of exotic tableware are also a sight to behold - very unique and unusual! His sense of innovative style was also displayed in the presentation of the cheeses which are served on broken earthenware which put together form the shape of the island of Mallorca. 👍🏾The meals are very tasty, artistically presented and truly representative of the different regional flavours. The maestro chef himself also always makes the point to come out to greet guests, as well as personally serving out  dishes while giving background information about these. It’s always a pleasure to eat here and enjoy the culinary experience! 👍🏾",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r761363851-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,5,en

Late afternoon we made a reservation via their website, leaving the credit card details for a reservation for that evening and awaited confirmation. It did not arrive and not being able to get anyone by phone to check they were expecting us and given the restaurant was a 40 min drive away, we made other arrangements. Then one hour after the time of the requested reservation a Genestra colleague called asking where were we. We explained the situation and how disappointed we were. Bearing in mind this all took place in a 5 hour window, the Andreu Genestra  maître d′ decided to charge £60 per person cancellation fee and took the payment from the credit card. A rather mean act by an individual who has no care for the value of tourists or the reputation of the restaurant.

2024-10-03,Cemil G,"I had been to Neolokal a few times some years ago, pre-Covid, and was happy with my meals. It then served very good Turkish cuisine with a touch of sophistication.  In the meantime, NeoLokal got awarded a Michelin star and a Green Michelin star. Unfortunately, my recent visit was unfortunately a pretty bad experience. It has become a pretty pretentious restaurant (watching a small film on an iPad before a dish ??!!), with non describable bland food and pretentious, haughty service. We had chosen one of the 2  wine flights proposed to accompany our meal (fixed menu), and the sommelier had described all the wines on the flight. However, the last 2 wines served were different than the ones described and were rest of bottles (presumably from another wine flight) - we literally  received tasting portions for the last 2 wines as there wasn't much left in the bottles. I presume the sommelier didn't want to open new bottles for us, as we were the last table in the mostly empty restaurant. Food was uniformly bland, with the best dish being the one presented by the iPad video (based on morel mushrooms, which, ironically for a green star michelin, are not in season).  To cap this off, the bill came to 250 euros per head. I don't remember the last time I've had such bad value for money.  I can't say whether the restaurant received the star based on the experience I've had, or was ruined after the Michelin star by changing its cuisine and jacking up the prices. Regardless, this was pretty bad on all fronts.  There's much better food to be had in Istanbul at more reasonable prices. I'm steering well clear in future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r972368794-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,2,en
2024-09-26,J2024,"A certain price range brings certain expectations whether you consider that fair or unfair is up to the individual.  So What do I expect at this price range? Exemplary, knowledgeable friendly service and a memorable meal great across the board with at least a couple of truely outstanding dishes.  So I made a reservation for 9 pm had been in contact with the restaurant throughout the week. I arrived at 2015 approx intention to have a couple or more cocktails seated at the bar said to host brought me outside past the bar to the seated area at this stage if I wasn’t going to be able to sit at the bar I would rather be inside with a view so I asked to be put inside by a window . I managed one cocktail Aztec dream quite nice but were pushing to get started I think they asked me for my menu chiloices this is where I knew there would be issues because I had already been emailed in advance and asked for my menu choices in my case the standard tasting menu and the premium wine pairing system allegedly because the restaurant espouses a sustainable ethos and only does enough to match customers on the night fair enough great idea in practice but obviously wasn’t true or a sloppy night since I had already picked but I  finished my cocktail looking for another but they had already started with the food again well before 2100 so I just went with the wine, asked for the wi fi access again took ages.  Of the food the mushroom morel was great, the lamb three styles was at least interesting and the bonito was the one dish that matched my expectations fabulous across the board everything else completely forgettable.  The premium wine list was at least interesting a collection of premium Turkish wines I am not familiar with Turkish wines and it was a pleasure to become acquainted but even there when I ventured a couple of questions at the sommelier he looked at me blankly and walked away which to be fair may have been just a language barrier.however the fact that no one from beginning to end including when I was paying asked me how I got on is, at this level, unforgivable maybe the fact I was a solo diner was a factor? Look not the worst meal I ever had , not by a long shot, but at this level Michelin it was the only one where I have been slightly frustrated and very bored throughout make of that what you will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r971486180-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,2,en

Some of the dishes are a bit foreign for a Western European palate but worth trying out.

Neolokal tasting menu is a ""gourmet' take on Turkish cuisine that sometime seemed to be trying too hard.  We were particularly amused by the pretentious video they made of their morel mushroom course as were several other guests.  Not necessary as the entree spoke for itself.

2024-06-07,Simon Baker,"Once upon a time, a quirky artist decided to swap his canvas for a plate and took his talents to Neolokal, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Istanbul. The artist’s mission? To create a feast for the eyes, if not for the taste buds.  As we entered Neolokal, we were greeted by a gallery of glassware and ceramics that could make a museum curator green with envy. Each plate was a canvas, and each dish a masterpiece—but only in appearance. It’s as if Neolokal hired Michelangelo to plate their food, but left the cooking to someone who thinks salt and pepper are exotic spices.  The meal began with an array of appetizers that looked like they were designed by a team of architects. Each bite was visually stunning, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, like a modern art piece you almost feel guilty for eating. However, one nibble in and you realize that the excitement ends at the eyes. The flavors were fresh and authentic, yes, but boring.  Then there was the foam. Oh, the foam! So many dishes came with its own fluffy cloud, a frothy crown atop each plate. It felt like Neolokal had an obsession with foam, perhaps believing it could carry the flavor burden. Instead, it felt like we were dining in a culinary car wash, where every taste got lost in a sea of bubbles. The foam was everywhere—salads, mains, even the desserts &  cocktails. I half-expected my coffee to come with a side of foam, and a barista in a scuba suit.  The following courses continued the trend—each one a Picasso on a plate, visually breathtaking but with flavors that were more 50 shades of beige. The dishes didn’t push any flavor boundaries; they played it safe, opting for elegance over excitement. Neolokal’s approach seemed to be ‘dress to impress,’ but they forgot that our tongues don’t care about haute couture—they want a flavor explosion, not a fashion show.  As we sipped our wine from glasses that looked like they were sculpted by Rodin himself, we couldn’t help but feel a little underwhelmed. Neolokal delivered a sensory feast for the eyes, but left our taste buds yearning for something more daring, something that would challenge and excite. It was a meal that satisfied the Instagram feed, but left the palate looking for more.  In the end, Neolokal is a place where the plate is the star, and the food is its understudy. It’s a restaurant that knows how to wow visually, but needs to remember that eating is not just about looking—it’s about tasting, and that’s where they missed the mark. If you’re after a meal that’s as beautiful as a museum exhibit but tastes like a chef’s day off, then Neolokal is your destination. Just don’t expect your taste buds to send a post card.   Oh and whilst money isn't everything, they charged €450  for three glasses of cognac. An entire bottle is €350... #justsayin",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r954117817-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,3,en
2024-04-06,Curtis H,"Yes, this is a one star.  And yes, some of the dishes are first rate.  But it is a model of just how silly (or pretentious, or fussy) some contemporary restaurants can be.  The technique behind every dish is impressive (and time consuming and very very expensive).  But the technical accomplishments seem less important than the taste.  For one dish, for example, an iPad is brought to your table and you are required to watch an overblown video on “The soil.  The fire.  The dish” and such.  Great view.  Great wine choices.  And a waiter that is the spitting image of Uriah Heep.

Overall, it was great food - the presentation and flavors are everything you would expect from a Michelin restaurant. That also includes the service. The food was tasty and so were the drinks.   I'd say the only critique I have is I wish our server took more time explaining the ingredients of the dishes - often time he would mention what the dish's name was and serve. Also, there is one part of the tasting menu where they give you a tablet to watch a video on how the dish they are about to serve is made. This part of the tasting menu felt a little gimmicky. Also, the price of this dinner is on par with Michelin restaurants in the US - be prepared to pay $200+ for 2 people.  It's a restaurant worth going to and the food, service, and overall quality shows why it has a Michelin star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r943217513-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,5,en
2023-12-12,Mahmut b,"Neolokal's Tasting Menu is a gastronomic journey that seamlessly blends traditional Turkish flavors with modern culinary innovation. The experience begins with the enticing aroma of their SOURDOUGH bread, served with parsley-marbled butter and cep mushroom powder—a delightful start to the meal.  The Amuse Bouches showcase the chef's creativity, with standout dishes like SINKONTA, featuring olive oil-braised pumpkin and zucchini varieties, complemented by a pumpkin and mandarin sauce, onion, and vegetable foam. BONITO presents an olive oil-braised spotless black-eyed pea 'pilaki' with tarragon and fish sauce, delivering a harmonious fusion of flavors.  The MOREL DUMPLING is a culinary masterpiece, combining mushroom sauce and emulsion with sautéed morel and isot oil. The BLUEFISH with CHARD, accompanied by a shrimp sheet and shrimp sauce, offers a delicate balance of textures and tastes. A refreshing interlude comes in the form of the SORREL SORBET, cleansing the palate for the next culinary delights.  The main course features the SLOW COOKED LAMB, accompanied by a unique combination of meatball and 'kokoreç,' served with sweet bean 'piyaz.' The dish exemplifies Neolokal's commitment to incorporating traditional Turkish elements into their contemporary creations.  For dessert, the REVANİ WITH ROSE is a sweet symphony, showcasing rose milk ice cream, rose delight, and coconut meringue—an elegant and fitting conclusion to the meal. To add an element of surprise, the Neolokal team presents an array of delightful desserts, rounding off the dining experience on a high note.  The Tasting Menu at Neolokal is a testament to the culinary prowess of Chef Maksut Aşkar and his team. Each dish is a work of art, skillfully combining flavors, textures, and presentation.

2023-11-22,Aldo C,"We enter a beautiful building a few minutes from the Galata Tower. Going up to the first floor, there is a mezzanine. You enter directly into the restaurant, or rather a completely open space with a visible kitchen. There is no one at the entrance, which gives you the feeling of being in a canteen. From the kitchen you go up a flight of stairs and only at the top is anyone there to greet you and escort you to your table. We asked for a nice table with a view and were satisfied. So far so good, they help us to sit down, take our coats and immediately present us with the menus, food, wines and cocktails.  We had already chosen the menu, we had been asked to do so by email in the days before our arrival in Istanbul. We ask for two cocktails, very good and well made, but to accompany them they only bring us some salted gherkins and roasted hazelnuts. They could do much better! I choose the wine with the help of the maitre sommelier, who gives me good advice. There are plenty of waiters and maitre sommeliers, as well as guys with trays bringing food from downstairs to the room. All the staff were dressed formally, with an alternative twist of white trainers. The service is quite attentive (we are in a Michelin starred restaurant! let's not forget! ), but you feel like a number, not a  guest. To underline this, the chef and co-owner, despite being in the room several times and interacting  and sit with only one table ... completely forgetting about all the other guests seated there.  He had no regard for the other diners in his restaurant. This is a serious omission in a Michelin Star  restaurant. As we had a tasting menu, we did not feel taken on a culinary journey. Some dishes,  refined in their presentation, bat all lacked something... a pity. Personally, I expected much more given the level of the restaurant. Overrated. Bad idea to use a tablet and headphones to explain a dish....Where is the Chef??  Note: if you run out of the little bread they give you at the beginning, they don't bring it . We appreciated the petit four they gave us at the end. Price: very very expensive for the experience we had.

2023-08-19,Joseph W,"Disappointed. We have eaten in many Michelin one star (and two star) restaurants in a number of countries and  therefore expected a better level.  Pricing - was middle to high for this level. Euro 305 without drinks for 6 course tasting menu, including automatic 12% service charge for two people.  Location - upper floor with a very good view for approx half the dinners.  Staff - ok but not great. Polite and plenty of them but not switched on. Very basic presentation and explanation of dishes. Had to ask them to repeat explanations. One excellent point was a little booklet that gave background on each dish on the tasting menu. Although the ingredients didn’t alway seem to match what was actually on the plate. I would not complain about the service but equally it was not professional enough. For instance the first time we were asked if we were enjoying the meal was as we were paying the bill.  Food - for us this is the key element and this is why we can only score them at 3 out of five. Presentation on the plate was very good. Variety of tastes, intensities and textures was not at the right standard. Vegetables in particular were disappointing - too many beans and nothing much else to balance it. Two main courses - black bass and shredded beef. The fish was blended into a purée consistency and lacking identifiable flavours while the beef was very rich without sufficient balancing flavours and texture.  So overall the food was good, just not at the expected level. Staff were pleasant and lots of them but also not at the correct professional level. To put it in context we had an excellent meal the previous evening at 40% of the cost in a great setting, with a similar level of service.

The chef's use of vegetables that he collects and his obvious desire to connect with diners are extraordinary.

2015-11-28,victoriouswong,"The very best meal I had in Tokyo and Kyoto was here. It's a 2-star Michelin restaurant that is very hard to make a reservation (only about a dozen seats and a lot of regulars who make reservations in advance). However, if you can splurge and get in, then you'll be in for a treat of your life. Our hotel concierges (Ritz Carlton and the Yoshikawa Inn both tried for us) were able to get us on a waitlist and fortunately someone dropped out. Normally you need to book at least a month in advance.  The chef/owner goes and forages the mountain every day for fresh produce (it's basically the Japanese version of Noma). There's a heavy emphasis on the local vegetables and seasonality. There's also a bent towards seafood protein over land. There are so many courses and you'll leave full no matter how hungry you are.   You can't really recommend a particular thing cause the menu changes so often but basically expect to taste whatever season you're in and the local flavors. Everything was just so beautifully presented and tasted like the embodiment of the season at its peak.  The chef tried his best to speak English to us and did a pretty good job actually of explaining the intricate dishes and their ingredients. Some of the regular patrons who had superior English helped out in explaining but it's clear that they don't get as many non-Japanese guests as Japanese guests. But they were all very kind and helpful, which made the whole evening so wonderful to share the experience with such kind strangers.  You can tell the chef takes enormous pride in his food and has a lot of confidence in his skills -- as he should.   In the end, the chef even walked us out to our taxi and gave us his business card which was a very nice touch. I will remember this experience forever as truly magical and as having transformed my perspective on Japanese cuisine and what's possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r329624309-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

We were also lucky his cute son was in the country since he could explain all the courses in detail in fluent English. They did not offer alcoholic beverages right away, we had to ask for them, they don't have a drinks menu. What makes it even more authentic. So glad afterwards, when we got the bill, their sakes were at very normal prices. Also the incredible, typical Japanese courtesy by the chef and his son to follow us outside and greeting us at the taxi door. Important to know: this is natural cuisine, not cooking special combinations like French top cuisine, which remains therefore a higher category than the Japanese, as far as I am concerned. Still absolutely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r278130838-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en
2015-02-27,GastronomicHunter,"Having been unable to secure a booking at some of the more sought after Kaiseki in Kyoto such as the legendary Mizai and unwilling to fork out for Kitcho - we decided to try a Kaiseki that was rated highly by the locals on Tabelog and also rated by the Michelin guide at 2 stars.   I must premise this review in saying that three of the four members present for the meal had never tried Kaiseki.  I will keep this review relatively brief and highlight the best and worst.  Food - First dish with a selection of mountain flowers, local fish, and vegetables was out of this world. The flavours and textures contained within a single dish in every single element of the plate demonstrated an exceptional understanding of both produce and the combination of flavours. Together, it demonstrates a level of precision and thinking that few chefs have. Easily a very solid 3 star dish.   Many of the other dishes after this were excellent. The clear broth, the crispy fish bones, the old style mackerel ""cheese"" sushi. A great deal of these were solid 2 if not 3 star dishes.   However, some of  the other dishes in the middle received mixed feelings from the party. Some such as the carp with vegetables were extremely pungent and powerful - and whether it was excellent or terrible could be based on personal preference. Later dishes such as the salted river fish was also excessively salty and the 'breakfast' plate confounded the party. One party member suggested that the meal had become too intense.   However the ending showed Nakahigashi's genius in understanding flavours and textures. The dessert of a sake sorbet over grapefruit with a slice of dried fig and a piece of dark chocolate was a flash of genius. The balance of the mild cold sake against the texture and slight bitterness of the grapefruit already represented a high level of gastronomic understanding. The addition of the sweet but dried fig and the dark chocolate added a new dimension to the dish. The ability to create such an incredible marriage of flavours and textures from just four ingredients is  truly remarkable. This simple dessert is truly one of the best, if not the best dish i've ever eaten.   Food - Overall the food was incredible. Although there were some mistakes, some dishes were simply mind blowing. The quality, skill and thought would give this place a solid 2.5 stars.   Service - Extremely well received. Nakahigashi made an effort to speak in english to us and made sure we were well taken care of. The wife? was very thoughtful. Small things like spilt broth was cleaned from placemats between every course. Overall service was 3 stars.   Ambience/Atmosphere - Nice traditional counter top seating allowed us front row seats to preparation. Very clean. In context of japan, would rate interior/ambience at 2 stars.   Value - at 70k Yen for 4 people this was a very memorable kaiseki experience and I consider this relatively good value.   Overall - Excellent food and excellent service. Solid 2 michelin star restaurant. If several dishes from the middle had been removed I might even have thought this was 3 star level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r256649176-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

2016-05-06,matiasrake,"Frederiksminde is situated in Hotel Frederiksminde (amd just to be clear, I would relly recommend to combine a dinner here with a stay at the hotel), and has recently been rewarded with their first Michelin star following what seems to be a long-laid plan from the hotel manager and head chef. Congratulations!  You eat in a classical dining room overlooking the fjord, service is very good and the atmoaphere soothing.  They offer a tasting menu with a varying number of dishes (from 3 to 9), and the flexibility is nice considering how some restaurants these days only offer big tasting menus. Included in the menu is also lots of appetizers and some very impressing petir four (I find how some restaurants have replaced their petit four with a single chocolate or a small candy quite annoying), a nice gesture from the kitchen.  The menu is new nordic in inspiration, based on local produce, but also give out a nod or two to more continental cuisine (for instance by serving their take on the entrecôte - god bless them!), and while the food might not be life-altering and mindblowing (ate at Daniel Bärlin the previous night - wow), it's genuinelly tasty and very well excecuted. Some new combinations, like a delicious creme fraiche dessert and lovely asparagus was really good.  Summed up: high-quality food in a very relaxing atmosphere near Copenhagen, definetily recommended!

The team was incredibly friendly and attentive, which made the evening even more enjoyable. A special highlight was the excellent wine pairing. The selection of Danish wines was impressive and paired perfectly with the dishes served. We were particularly thrilled by the quality and diversity of the Danish wines introduced to us. The restaurant's concept of focusing on local and sustainable products was reflected not only in the food but also in the overall philosophy of the establishment. This approach is not only commendable but also contributed to the uniqueness of our culinary experience.

Also I recommend trying the rhubarb gin it’s super delicious!

The menu and the wine menu didn't bring the best out in each other and the taste sensation we were left with was sour and the odour putrid. The end result was indigestion.  The staff was as always alert and competent and the  servings was  beautifully presented - that is the only reason it is not a 1 star review.   I had the sensation that the owner is making a lot of experiments which is great, however he have forgotten the saying ""kill your darlings"" - it might be a fun and unique experiment but that doesn't mean it is good. An example was the homemade sparkling apple based ""wine"".  If Domestic  is unable to match existing products in the market (f.ex.

The kitchen is still very dogmatic and experimental but I found it to less ""over-the-edge"" this time than on previous visits; like they are more rooted in their concept. The menu was still very exiting but each dish came with a depth that I hadn't experienced before. They certainly did seem to have a beedrock of confidence in the way the food was presented.   Still visually beautiful creations. The snack w. duck heart, lobster tail and grilled purple cale was out of this world. The best dish was the celariac w. mussels. Halibut w. flowers and sauce was visually stunning and flavourful and the duck was cooked to perfection.   Wine list is rather extensive and I found the ratio between natural and more conventional wines to be more balanced than previously. And reasonably priced in terms of Danish prices.

2021-08-05,tlowens75,"Let me first say that Restaurant Domestic is a bit hard to find - you go into a courtyard off the main road and need to follow the signs. Not too hard, just a bit unexpected since it doesn't face the main road.  Even though it's a Michelin-starred restaurant, it seems very warm and casual. We started our evening on the outside porch, then moved in for the rest of our meal. The tables are well-spaced out - I don't know if that's a social distancing thing or just normal, but it made it seemed relaxed inside.  So the meal consisted of 18 courses/pairings (the ""discovery"" menu - they offer a shorter one with 11 - the ""insight"")! That seems huge, I know - but most of the items are 2-3 bites. You will leave full at the end of the night, though. You could pick from three drink pairings: juices/kombucha, classic wines, or ""curious"" wines. We went with the curious because why not? We had some very adventurous and non-traditional wines - like unusual grape varieties or unique fermentation methods. I don't think any of the wines were Danish; that rule only applies to the food, I guess.  All the food is sourced from Denmark, hence the name ""Domestic."" It's actually a pretty cool concept, as the chefs need to come up with unique pairings based on what is available locally and in season. You get a little bit of everything: seafood, beans, bread, flowers, fruits, meat. I really enjoyed the plaice/peas and the miso/koji pairings in particular. The platings are unique and little works of art. My husband and I enjoyed every minute of our meal and left feeling full, yet relaxed. Service was fantastic and shared by pretty much all of the waitstaff. It's expensive, but worth it.  Warning: don't plan on doing much else for the evening if you pick the full dinner experience.

In terms of the tasting 4 course, tartare of beef was bland, pork main also uninspiring, mushrooms too greasy. Local cod good, but nothing wow, though Jerusalem artichoke was fab.
