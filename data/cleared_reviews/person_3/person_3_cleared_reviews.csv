2024-10-28,Gessica C,"I state that I am not an expert in the field. The guys in the room are nothing short of wonderful. They love what they do and they pass it on to their skins. The food has made my imagination and my attention to translate visually every taste tasted flavor, but I did not understand why being careful not to waste and to enhance what the territory offers, were combined with French wines that in my opinion did not link with the flavors of local food.  I did not like the shape on arrival, ""we invite you to the aperitif room waiting for the table"", we were poured 2 glasses of water NOT required, and after paying a very important bill, we were asked for an extra 15 euros for 2 glasses of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r976936414-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,3,en
2024-10-16,goldenerreiter,"I have been observing Mr Niederkofler’s cuisine for a while and during a holiday in South Tyrol, watching from afar became a haptic and culinary experience. The reception was appropriate for a top house and the start in the salon, with the amouse bouche, was also very successful. Afterwards there was a guided tour of the restaurant and in addition to the dining facilities, reference was also made to the company Moessmer, which owns the Villa. Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression. The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table. But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain. Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures. In the end, the long walk was absolutely worth it and even if the expectations were already very high, they were even topped a bit. Many thanks to the entire team for a memorable evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r974113072-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

Aperitif in the garden with the very cordial welcome of Chef Niederkofler who will also join us later to inquire about liking and then say goodbye.

2024-08-26,Deb75Milan_Italy,"The Villa is beautiful, elegant and welcoming and the service was excellent. But the experience was not unforgettable, the expectations were obviously very high given the fame of the chef, but the dishes did not excite me. The only zero km menu executed in a perfect way, but the dishes do not give emotions.

2024-08-15,robylit,"I would like to point out that the judgment is related to the category. The expectations for a 3 Michelin star are wow effect with every dish or as the Guide says “worth the trip”.  Definitely appreciable Cook the Mountain philosophy. There were highs (snails and Alpine grey meat) and some other dishes from which I would have expected more (risotto), a bit anonymous (salad). A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing. Considering the important price of the menu not appreciated the proposal of historical dishes off the list with additional cost to add. Wide proposal on champagne, limited on Italian sparkling wines, mark-up acceptable.

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en

2024-04-08,Alessandro P,"Among the 3-star experiences is that of the atelier moessmer was one of the most surprising. I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit. In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved. Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen. The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques. We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet. Even the management, times and portions proved to be simply adequate for the experience. Ultimately it is something that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates haute cuisine and this type of experience.

A team and excellent service as well as the quality of the typical products of the area, as well as the technique and research of each dish on the tasting menu, justify both the €300 per person, in addition to the wines, and the three stars awarded to the master Norbert Niederkofler , the only chef in the world to obtain them when opening a new restaurant.

2023-12-27,RobertoM,"In fact, it is precisely curiosity that inexorably leads me to persevere with these experiences, albeit with some perplexity each time. Questions I will never have answers to. Is it worth a long journey and an extremely expensive expense to ""eat""? Common sense and practical reason would say no! ! Imagination and curiosity would answer yes! If this were not the case there would be nothing beautiful, artistic, refined or aesthetic! I personally would just like the certainty that this is there and not a tested and pre-packaged mechanism. After this humble and personal general consideration of mine, in detail the house is very welcoming, perhaps the road to reach it is a little dark but it is a completely insignificant detail, the welcome is extremely professional, God forbid, but not taken for granted, the service in the youth room, polite and smiling, young and friendly sommelier. The menu satisfied us in terms of taste and presentation, perhaps I realize that the more you have experiences like this the more you have expectations, often senseless! It is always pleasant to have contact with the chef who in this case tells you the story, the choices and objectives, the projects, certainly following a script for each guest but it seems sincere and authentic.

Norbert, as a grand master, introduced us to the house with its history and its new destination.

2023-09-26,Albi23,"When this exceptional chef closed his restaurant in San Cassiano, in my opinion (and not only in my opinion) one of the best in the world, I really hoped he would reopen soon in another place. And so, without much publicity, here is this beautiful place in Brunico, created by renovating a villa a few meters from the centre, where the chef has designed everything to measure to be perfectly organized and to best accommodate the privileged guests who manage to book. The welcome is wonderful, in a lounge where you can drink a glass of champagne and taste the first delicacies of a dinner that will prove sublime. It takes us further to the table, for us a comfortable counter overlooking the kitchen, where throughout the evening we will see the painstaking work of a young team, who prepare the dishes with precision and attention as if they were working in an operating theatre. A journey begins that favors local raw materials, including the best butter we have tasted in my life, vegetables from the garden, fish and meat where you can feel the freshness, quality and ability to invent and prepare excellent dishes. A few photos will show the delicacies we ate. Very high quality wines in a well-stocked cellar. Impeccable service. We finish dinner in the initial lounge with a herbal tea and a small pastry.

I tried to call the restaurant repeatedly to correct this, but no one would ever answer the phone. I emailed, and they told me they were booked the evening of July 14 and could not accommodate me that night - which happens to be the only night I will be in Paris. They have refused to refund my deposit, despite the error on the part of their booking system.

The seafood was so fresh and beautifully cared for. Fresh, clean flavors that enhanced vs distracted from the high quality ingredients. Both raw and grilled oysters were amazing and the oyster tacos were out of this world! The only course we didn't love was the uni, which is typically one of my very favorite foods. Sadly this was the one item I felt was overworked, with the tomatoes outshining and overpowering the uni. That said, would go back in a heartbeat.

2022-02-21,Thebestmoneyspent,"The bubbly and the food are right on spot! However, I am giving only 3 stars to this place because with the prestige that they hold, one would've think they have the resources to spent in proper lighting for the guests to be able to go to the restroom safely. If you have a problem walking in the dark and feel unsafe about it, either do not visit this place in the winter months when sun goes down early in the afternoon or just avoid going to the restroom while you are there or just go during the day. I dared to go to the restroom by myself in the absolute dark, when I saw how dark it really was I came back and asked the waiter if they had any sensor lighting or if they could turn on some lights back there, he just said ""no we don't sorry"" so I proceeded to go back to my table and pick up my phone to help myself look after my steps using the phone's flashlight...Once I got to the restroom which is fairly far from the tables behind another part of the construction beside, there was a man inside the restroom next to me and I felt completely unsafe in that atmosphere...since it was so dark outside. Once I was trying to return with the same operation of turning my iphone lantern on, I started stepping in the gravel in the dark and that must have tipped off the dogs they have because I was surprised with the huge german shepherd they have unleashed on the property barking at me right beside me, which was very frightening considering the whole scene. ...Not a great end to the whole visit.

I am  a regular customer of the Brasserie (which is great and has in my view the best price to quality ratio in Luxembourg), and the second visit to the restaurant. My wife and I opted for the vegetarian menu. There are not many words to describe the food other than to say that it is a true revelation; compared to the earlier visit, I think it still has gone op a notch. The research that the Chef is putting into the local flora, the range of (local) herbs that he uses in his food, the complexity of flavors that he creates with vegetables and herbs only, and the extraordinary combinations are a testimony to the chef's talent and passion. My son had a smaller version of the menu (which does however feature the same dishes) - and I liked the fact that all of the amuse-bouche came for the 3 of us.  We really enjoyed this fantastic meal. I have been to many Michelin restaurants, most of them are great - with the focus on herbs and vegetables at this level, the Distillerie is however special - and in my view, one of the best vegetable based restaurants in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r757532703-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html,5,en

All you can hear is other customers talking. its a chateau, they should have had a fireplace, or atleast curtains at the very least. all wuld have been forgiven but the meal was just bad, the central theme was smoke, the smokiness in some of the courses was actually the only good taste, we tried the veg and the non-veg course,  understandably the vegetables were seasonal and one would expect them to be tasty or interesting. It was neither, from a potato dish that had a lot of  raw potato pieces, to oven baked cabbage leaves, celery bits on cabbage, nothing tasted good. The dessset was the biggest let down, i left most of my dishes on the plate and the hostess would only smile and say hope it was ok, well I left most of it so .... I really wanted to like it but it was below par, the wine was good not standout, but at 400 euros for two people, i would take my money elsewhere.

2020-02-23,Kathleen M,"Too many Michelin-starred properties with public chefs seem to have lost the one main ingredient necessary to any good meal...joy.  Joy in the cooking, joy in the serving and joy in the eating.  Tuju got the last two out of three correct...but with a center kitchen on full display, the first joy was blatantly missing.  Yes, food is important, and with a 12-course tasting dinner with paired wines, there are a lot of details that could possibly get missed, but kids, come on, it's food! Enjoy it!  Tabled in front of the finishing kitchen watching the 12 or so young professionals cooking and plating, I felt that I was witnessing a religious rite...all choreographed and all so, so serious.  To be fair, this appeared to be a reflection of Chef Ralston, who visited the kitchen several times to insure the creations were perfect...and they were.... seriously perfect.  Chef Ralston, and his executive chef Rhaiza, have created a beautiful and serene space in which to explore his seasonal take on Brazilian cuisine. And 'his take' is delicious, intriguing, sometimes challenging, and overall a delight; and one that I would love to revisit as the seasons change, however... My visit to Tuju was a highlight of a Pinheiros neighborhood food tour, unfortunately, it wasn’t the acme. And it could have been with just a hint of joy-in-the-doing emanating from the kitchen.

2019-09-26,Michael U,"Following the trail blazed by D.O.M., TUJU by Chef Ivan Ralston pushes modern Brazilian Cuisine forward by not specifically showcasing local Ingredients, but reinterpreting the world through Brazilian eyes inside his Restaurant at Rua Fradique Coutinho 1248.  Open since 2014, and recently the recipient of a second Michelin Star, it is after passing through a hushed hallway that guests find themselves inside Ralston’s “kitchen theater,” a staff fluent in English leading guests to polished wooden tables that extend back towards the bar and urban garden on the patio.  A quiet and focused space in Vila Madalena, everything from TUJU’s design to Cocktail list indicative of a Chef who has spent time researching both technique and his culture, guests visiting for the first time are encouraged to partake in Ivan’s “Season Menu,” the carte blanche taking into account allergies and dislike but otherwise consisting of thirteen courses served across two hours.  Trained in the kitchens of Maní, RyuGin and Mugaritz, the latter identifiable in modernist spins on local Produce, it was while sipping on a strong drink of Gin and sweetened Acid that course one arrived, sliced and aerated Pumpkin forming the background for Peas and Citrus with herbs that carry over nicely to a “Taco” comprised of sweet Crab and shaved Corn wrapped in Nasturtium.  Continuing light with translucent Shrimp swimming in vibrant Broth, its follow-up a comparison of local River Mussels to those from the Atlantic bathed in Manioc Root Juice, fans of Uni will be stunned by tender Tongues amidst a tangle of Leeks with Parsnip Cream while torched Cauliflower finds itself the centerpiece of a thick Sauce that tastes something like Mole mixed with Soy.  Shifting back to Seafood, a tender Tentacle obtained through Chef Ralston’s relationship with local fisherman accented in umami, one would be hard-pressed to name a more interesting *looking* dish than Arapaima Fish in Seaweed Pil Pil, the combination of snappy Flesh and Skin Crisps equally tantalizing alongside Artichokes and Bean Sprouts.  Completing savories with grilled Tuna and two types of Palm plus unsweetened Açaí, a diversity of textures seeing the best bites those that incorporate a little of each into a single forkful, it is by way of Cheese that the palate is transitioned, the Blue and Parmesan-mimic particularly impressive, as too was housemade Bread and Butter plus the bright green Fruit described as a Fig.   Not scaling back on sweets, Dessert number one perfuming stewed Berries with Mint in a makeshift Sundae, it was while Coffee dripped tableside that a tangy Yogurt Parfait dazzled, the Pour Over subsequently enjoyed with housemade Chocolates filled with everything from Dulce de Leche and Cashew Fruit to Garlic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r713116135-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en

2019-02-17,Viajante_SP,"It is not by chance that Tuju is top ranked by Trip Advisor users .   We have ordered the smallest tasting menu , which was creative and tasteful .   Lamb and fish were part of the sequence . Both were well prepared .  The carta of wines should be bigger to match such a good meals.   Brazilian ingredients reminded me another good restaurant : DOM and the Chef Atala.   High level service provided by waitress and maitre. Sommelier was not so confortable to speak in English ( I took a friend of mine from France to have a dinner at Tuju ).   Based on Brazilian standards and taking into account the order was the smallest menu and only two glasses of wine, the final price might be considered high. On the other hand, this level of restaurant would be charged in a similar level abroad.

2018-12-15,CaliGirlSAS,"My husband and I had the pleasure of experiencing the phenomenal culinary journey of the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairing and we were blown away.  Don’t listen to any reviews that say that there is no soul or flavor in the food. It’s quite the opposite - we felt that the complexity of the depth and layers of flavor was perfectly executed and also appropriately balanced for each course from start to finish. We each experienced varying levels of umami moments throughout the evening and enjoyed the uniquely Brazilian ingredients that we would never get to experience anywhere else.   The portions were well thought out.  I’ll have to admit that we were a bit intimidated with the idea of 12 courses but by the end we didn’t feel too full or heavy - just happily satisfied.   I’ll also note that I’m vegan and my husband doesn’t eat pork. They had no problem accommodating our dietary restrictions. We also had the privilege of speaking with Chef Ivan Ralston towards the end of our meal - he was such a lovely presence and it was clear from our discussion that he’s in pursuit of excellence and innovation through his craft.   We’ve eaten at Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and have sometimes been disappointed with some restaurants’ tasting menus given that one or more courses may end up being bland or weaker than the others. That was not the case here - each course was impressive. That’s quite a feat for 12 courses!  For all of the reasons noted above, we feel that this place deserves 3 stars instead of 2!  We hope to come back here again. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to dine here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r639715964-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en

2018-06-07,Xicorea,"We went for our anniversary dinner to Tuju last evening and had their five-course Farmers’ Market tasting menu. We felt it did not live up to our expectations from many perspectives.  First I would like to point out what we did like. Being light drinkers, we usually have just one glass of wine each. At Tuju, the by-the-glass offerings were outstanding, among the best I have seen in Brazil. Our server was also very intent on making sure we enjoyed the experience, going so far as offering a (very good) chocolate tasting to my chocolatolic wife, free of charge. Finally, we loved the dessert.  The first thing that bothered us was their timing. Shortly after we ordered the meal, the server brought us some butter, olive oil, and salt – but no bread. We waited and waited. Some 10 minutes later, the bread arrived. They claimed that it took so long because it was being warmed up. Yet we have been to many other places that serve warm bread without such delay.  We have been to a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Brazil and abroad, many I have reviewed on TA. Something we always enjoyed at such establishments was being surprised by the unusual flavors, textures, and looks. Tuju mostly failed at this.   Our first course was a broccoli-based appetizer (Broccoli in miso marinade, cauliflower, and walnuts). It had a fancy name and description and the texture was interesting. But the taste was rather bland.  They were out of the second course, white clam. We opted then for octopus (my wife) and a couscous (myself). My wife enjoyed the tender texture of the octopus, but was unimpressed with the rest. I felt my couscous was nothing special as well.  The first main dish was a fish coated with its own roasted and ground scales, rather good. It was well prepared, delicate and very enjoyable.  The second main dish was a wagyu beef rib, with manioc flour and bacon bits. We were both unimpressed, unfortunately.  The dessert was called a corn-meal brioche, but in fact it was pain perdu, and a very good one at that. It came with salt caramel and peanut ice-cream. It was by far the best course.  In spite of the friendliness and proactivity of our server, we felt that overall service lacked the professionalism and confidence a place of this caliber requires.  The overall impression we had was that in spite of the elaborate descriptions and well-designed settings, the dishes fell short of our expectations. We asked ourselves how Tuju could have been rated a two-star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r585854760-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,3,en

2018-03-08,gibbyone,"The food at Tuju was fantastic and definitely the highlight of our trip. We did the 12-course tasting and each course was beautifully presented. Every bite danced on your pallette. Ingredients were fresh. Unique flavors were expertly combined to compliment each other. Some of the highlights were: the frozen infused watermelon cubes with cucumber and buttermilk, manioc tortilla with smoked beets, crunchy chicken and the lychee with thyme cream was out of this world. Staff was attentive and knowledable and capable of describing dishes and wine in English. The seating and lighting could be improved for more ambience -- the seating was a little stiff and the lighting was a little too bright. Cocktails were also excellent, but the wait for them was a bit longer than it should have been. Pricing was typical for a tasting of this size and caliber. I was also impressed that they offered a shorter tasting menu should you choose not to go all in. Eating is a wonderful way to discover a city and Tuju helped give Sao Paulo five stars. I would put this place on your must-do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r565284199-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en
2018-03-03,Ericapm25,"We usually have “girl’s day out” at a nice place to celebrate our friendship and all.  We picked this place because it seemed really nice.   It is nice but sooo overpriced for the ingredients. I cook ( not even close to a chef, just making a point about ingredients, complexity etc) and I felt the menu lacked the “wow” effect.   Most of us chose the 12 course tasting menu. One couse was split pea soup. Come on!!!!   The drinks were good, We were impressed by the mixology. Desset was ok.  The cachaça ice cream was really really good. But 400 for  just one good dessert and a good drink is too much in my opinion.  I recommend  going for the experience. Go with friends to enjoy, visit the vegetable and herb garden they hold on the top floor.

2021-12-15,pushing p,"We were hugely disappointed with our experience here.   The restaurant is on a busy street with no signs for parking and no direct signage where to enter.  When we entered the restaurant there was loud banging from the open kitchen. Chef Anthony was banging something in a large pan then several of the other staff took their turns. The waiters were all dressed in chef whites while Chef Anthony wore a t-shirt and baseball cap.  The restaurant was not busy. The waiters were nervously busy, walking back and forth. It was very distracting. After Chef Anthony left they seemed to calm down without their nervous energy.   I ordered the vegan menu. My husband ordered a non-vegan menu.   The waitstaff was cordial however we waited a good 15 minutes before being asked if we would like an apéritif. We were served an amuse bouche. Mine was some sort of plant-based sushi. The rice was like concrete and it looked like a child made it. Not a good first impression of the food. Up to that point the wine menu had not been presented and my husband asked to see it.   My husband ordered wine and the bottle delivered did not match the description on the menu. We signaled to one of the waiters and he apologized, agreeing with my husband that the wine served was incorrect. The bartender (sommelier??) came immediately and loudly berated my husband for being wrong. Thank goodness for the Vivino wine app because my husband was able to show the bartender the wine label that should have corresponded with the wine menu. The bartender still argued, so loudly that the diners beside us stopped eating to see what was going on. My husband is very patient and quiet - he did not argue but let the incident go. Afterwards the bartender came again, making his point once more about the wine served was indeed the wine on the menu but the only label was incorrect. If a wine menu states that it is a certain wine, then that is what should be served, not an arbitrary one. Nor should the customer be loudly berated for the restaurant’s error. The wine incident was very stressful.  The food was not delicious. Some of the plates looked very nice but they lacked any flavor and seasoning. Hardly what’s expected in a Michelin star restaurant.  Since my seat was facing the kitchen I had a bird’s eye view of all the busyness. I saw a small styrofoam box on the floor. I didn’t give it a second thought until shortly after. The waiter put that same styrofoam box directly on our table (after being on the floor) to prepare a dry ice sorbet. I was shocked it went from the floor to our table. The sorbet had a showy presentation but had zero flavor.   My main course was some sort of architectural stack that fell over when the waiter put it in front of me. He tried to correct it with his long tweezers but was unsuccessful. He then used his bare fingers to correct the presentation. It should have immediately been taken back to the kitchen. This is the same waiter that plunked the styrofoam box from floor to table. That’s when we decided to leave.   We did not finish the rest of the courses because the experience had been such a disaster. The waiters looked visibly shocked and gathered to have “meeting” about our bill.  They reduced my husband’s portion while charging me the full price. They also did not charge us for the wine problem and neither did they apologize.   Before we paid, I went to the ladies room. The door handle to the stall came off and I couldn’t get out. The bathrooms have dark walls and low lighting and I could not see to reattach the handle. My phone was at the table so calling was not an option. After 15 minutes was able to wiggle the mechanism to open the door. Since the handle would not reattach, I took it to one of the waiters and he never blinked an eye for the inconvenience. I’m not making this up - the photo is below.   We will never go back to the restaurant. Even if it was inexpensive (which it wasn’t), in addition to all the faux pas, the food had no flavor and the service was not on par to any Michelin restaurants we have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g230063-d8065598-r822091830-Anthony_s_Kitchen-Meerbusch_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,1,en

His communication was easy going and combined with lots of laughter from us and himself. The whole atmosphere was gorgeous. Next to the fact that we all learned a lot about cooking in general and especially about our self prepared dinner we had so much fun. Anthony is an intelligent, charming and very knowledgeable person who can transmit the difficulties of cooking in a super easy way.

2021-12-15,SeanSky,"In Nuremberg on business and decided to go all-in for the best possible dinner experience.  If you have dined somewhere like Alinea (Chicago, IL), you know what fine dining can be -- Essigbraetien has earned its stars and deserves three!  From the moment you enter, you are treated as the only guests.  Trust the front of house and the kitchen staff to leave you feeling ""blown away"".  If you are an enophile, definitely include the wine pairing - selections from their cellar are perfectly matched with each course - and you will not find these wines in a retail store.  Very intimate setting but still appropriate for a business dinner for two.  Worth every euro and every moment spent dining with this team!  Frankly, this restaurant is the one reason to travel to Germany!  To the restaurant - please forgive that my review is in English.  But, language was no barrier to an amazing evening.  Many many thanks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r822090783-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,5,en

Attentive and well-informed staff operating in a small, comfortable dining room, and bringing treasures to the table! The five course no choice lunchtime menu was full of variety of texture, flavour and colour, a feast for the eyes and the taste buds. Marvellous subtle flavours from herbs, the chervil sauce in particular was a delight. There is a very good wine list in addition to the possibility of wine-pairing.

We have been to two 1 Michelin star restaurants in the past, but this was our first 2 Michelin star restaurant and it did not disappoint. Many of the dishes are vegetarian, but they are just as delicious as the meat dishes. There was also an optional wine pairing for each course if you wish.

Each dish of the many courses was described in detail as it was delivered to us. If this all sounds amazing it was, and very upscale with prices to match. The wines were also high calibre and interesting.  Each course, the five main ones and the many tasters in between were all very different multi layer flavour sensations. Each one was a new experience for our palates to, sometimes quite slowly, unravel and eventually enjoy.

While there are a couple meat  dishes, out of the seven courses, all was very enjoyable. My son (teenager) is not a fan of vegetables, but loved every vegetable dish. If you’re looking for meat in every dish, based on the one night we dined here, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a diverse meal this should be a must. Don’t expect inexpensive if you’re eating at a Michelin starred restaurant, expect quality.  That’s what you’ll receive here, quality. My family & I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday dinner here!

However unfortunately, it had no air-conditioner. through the opened windows, some bees and flies irritated us to take dinner. and we dont like vegetable, so we didn't taste the food. just enjoy seeing the wonderful foods. meat was just one in all food and the price is a little high to us.  consequently, I recommend this restaurant to vegetarians and those who wanna take special and newly taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r607425490-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,3,en
2018-07-09,iloveeshly,"We dine for the past 10 years all over the world in the best restaurant as part of our job to cater to our high class clients. I personally adore vegetables and bland food. My partner is a vegetarian. We both eat tiny portions, but I felt like I've been given literally one slice of leek over the whole evening. Luckily I went for the 7 course menu that included a hip of lamb, so I wasn't going home completely starved as my girlfriend did who went for the 4 course meal instead. I wasn't asked how I like the meat, it was bloody medium rare. It was tender but nothing spectacular. Just a good piece of lamb, chewy tho and hard to cut without a steak knife. It was still the highlight of my dinner that gave me some filling satisfaction. We both love healthy, regional organic food- but the price is just ridiculously high for what it is-  Poor people food (leeks, celery, onion)  Delicious, but for that price I'm expecting lobster, Beluga Caviar,  Wagyu Beef and Champagne. We payed 400 Dollar for 2, only had 2 regional glasses of wine and came home hungry. Yes, the dishes were super cute presented in extremely tiny portions and beautifully arranged but nothing spectacular out of this world that's new or not seen before.  The windows were open the whole evening, attracting lots of flies into the glasses of water and wine. Maybe a net over the open window would be useful. We give the one star for the excellent service, that was really spectacular. You can tell the servants are highly trained and skilled. The door was held open, the napkin was replaced when falling on the floor immediately and the staff spoke perfect English. It was also great to see the chef comming to the tables. We only give one star in total because the price in comparison to what is offered is really not appropriate. Complimentary choclate chunks are given at the end which is really nice, but now I feel a bit sick eating all of them because of the hunger, smaller choclate would match the tiny menu. A note about holding a conversation down in this small formal room would be good with the mostly American visitors that evening talking  so loudly we knew all about their private business at the end of the evening. My partner is American and felt offended by their loud conversations. We missed some kind of gentle music. Unfortunately live music in not cherished anywhere when it gives such a great atmosphere. We expected to be blown away but we are quite surprised of what people think is unique and out of this world.....To us it's everyday healthy food that should be served in bigger portion for cheaper. We would be eating there daily. But with literally one leek on the plate you can't go home satisfied. We haven't regret going there tho, we had a great evening. We would not go back. Thank you for the great attentive and professional table service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r594762405-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,1,en
2018-06-25,Brian Randall,"Having dined in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years, this year our visit was to Nuremberg and consequently Essigbratlein. Possibly rather more quaint than other starred restaurants we had visited, from ringing the bell to enter to the internal décor. As one would expect, service was impeccable but pleasantly jovial. Now for the difference, that lies in the unusual style of food, from the many amuse bouches to the clever and possibly unique use of vegetables. The menu I shall be posting with this review has lost a great deal in translation and is over simplified beyond belief. As always, we chose to drink the paired wines and had the privilege of tasting some superb well matched wines with our unusual meal. Overall, it was a very pleasant meal in a quaint restaurant, but would we go again, probably not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r590502512-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,4,en

I have been to countless 2 and 3 star restaurants, but I keep coming back to Essigbrätlein and Etxebarri because they continue to impress me every time.  For me the best places are about brilliant ideas, talent, simplicity, hard work, honesty, service and fair prices. Essigbrätlein excels on every front - and several months later I still remember exactly how some dishes tasted.   In particular the ""cucumber and tomato"" dish stands out. I don't know how it's possible to take so simple ingredients and turn them into such an amazing experience. But Essingbrätlein knows and I can't recommend this place enough.

2024-09-26,mokstarr7,"I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.  First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.  Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.  Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.  I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses. This is yet another example of how service is lacking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r971450381-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,3,en

The encounters were special: anyone who wishes to know how a few drops of mulberry oil could transform the aroma, look and taste of a dish must come here (we felt nothing). Anyone wonders how a deep fried slice of ""algae"" could be made to look like a half-piece of an oyster shell (with much imagination) and possibly taste like one (we failed...) should make an effort to dine here. Anyone who longs to taste beef without the real sensation of meat (small dark pieces of something supposedly to be beef) ought to be confronted in The Rutz Weinbar & Restaurant.

2023-08-17,AnGr2013,"We had dinner here. My wife and I eat at Michelin restaurants occasionally and were really looking forward to this. Our table was at the ground level of the hotel, felt like a dark hotel lobby with simple furniture. We were placed at a table for four which made me feel the whole evening as if two guests were missing at our table. If I book for two, I want to sit at a table for two.  For the entire dinner experience the dull elevator music was in an endless loop and the presentation of the food was the same. Every dish in a large plate with a tiny, tiny dish in the middle, all dishes accompanied by some extra sauce poured or crunch that was served with a lot of tamtam.   All dishes came with unbelievably elaborate explanations, at some point I felt tempted to tell the waiters that I just want to eat my food and not listen to them. The portions were miniscule even for three star Michelin standards.  The more explanations a dish needs, the less I trust it. Good food needs to speak for itself.      The desserts should be the grand finale, when the kitchen pulls out all the stops to bring the meal to a grandiose  ending. Far away from that in our experience.   Last but not least the wine menu: I find my way around any wine menu and dont need the help of the sommelier. But the Rutz wine menu doesnt even tell me if the wine is white or red (for appellations that produce both) I felt almost embarrassed to ask the sommelier.  And when the bill came and I saw I was charged EUR 32 for a 0.1l glass of champagne, I left the place angry and will not return.

2023-06-16,Xierwan,"We were eager to try the restaurant, as we had many good surprises with German chefs who had emigrated to countries other than Germany. Indeed, the country seems to have taken the same direction as its northern European neighbours for several years, with on the one hand a modern and inventive cuisine and on the other a completely revisited traditional cuisine.  The restaurant itself is superb, as well as the terrace, on which we were seated. The wines and food were all extraordinary without exception, as they should be in any establishment of this range (and with these high prices, it must be said).  The service is smooth, professional but also very relaxed, just like in any Scandinavian restaurant and also as nice and friendly as are the inhabitants of Berlin. Special thanks to the sommelier for his excellent advices and to the waiter who gives a casual thumbs up to signify that he is happy with our praise of the food.  This was a great experience for us, but I would perhaps not recommend it to people who think high gastronomy should always be buttoned up to the neck with old fashioned and stiff waiters in suit.

2023-06-07,MartinTafft,"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  We had high hopes and expectations from the reputation and the three Michelin star badge.  We regularly visit good restaurants when we are on our travels at home and in Europe.    We chose to have the eight course menu with the accompanying wine flight.  Things started pretty well with two or three really tasty and enjoyable amuse-bouche dishes.  Unfortunately, as the meal progressed we found ourselves increasingly disappointed by the standard of some of the dishes.  We also had a very distinct feeling that a number of the dishes were just far too oily.   Normally, the selected wines that accompany each course have the function of enhancing and complementing the flavours of the dishes, however, it felt as though they had been selected to try to combat the oiliness of the dishes.  Before we came to the end of the meal, we both were beginning to feel the slightly ill effects of the greasy nature of the meal.  When I compare this experience with many other recent experiences of less well acclaimed restaurants, and some other one and two star restaurants, I found it both disappointing from a culinary and flavour experience and also poor value for money.

We were looking forward so much to this, but all together it really was a little disappointing… Lots of great restaurants in Berlin, would not return here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r879741160-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,2,en
2022-11-05,atrevida,"We requested a table for 4 a couple of weeks before coming to Berlin and were delighted that a table became available off the waitlist. We dined as a family of 4, with my husband and two daughters (both 12). We absolutely loved this dinner - it was one of the best we've had in a long time, and we've eaten at numerous 3* Michelin restaurants all around the world. They are thoughtful about the flavor of each dish and how it all comes together, without being pretentious. We especially loved the carp, the Mangalitsa pork, the nonalcoholic juice pairings, and the local German wines. They take humble ingredients and make them magical via alchemy - every dish was spectacular in its flavor, and the portion sizes perfect - we were full without the overfull, bloated feeling at the end of the meal. We loved the local German elements they incorporated into the meal - most of the ingredients are from local farmers and producers, although they are not fanatical about this and the emphasis really is on quality and making the meal fantastic. Service was great - very friendly and thoughtful without being intrusive in any way. Very memorable and definitely would return for more dinners here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r867326578-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,5,en

2022-10-08,Noa Aue,"The beauty of deception, pretending to be something that you’re not, lies in the element of surprise. The villain turns out to be the hero, the enemy to be a friend, and the fish to be a mushroom. Horváth jumps into the deep ocean waters of pretending, pushing the notions of what is and what is not from your eye, through your nose, and into your mouth.   A game of deception is as old and basic as we are. It goes back to childhood memories of Hide & Seek, Halloween parties filled with dress-ups, and your mum telling you it’s just an incessant piece of chuckled when it’s actually medicine. When we set down and had the first two dishes, everything was exactly where it should have been, with no deception. The wine was carefully chosen, the oyster mushroom false liver (foie gras) was spectacular, and the bread was simply on point. What can go wrong from here?   Do you know this art exhibition that doesn’t make sense no matter how many philosophical abstractions you make? That one friend that keeps arguing and arguing and takes it a bit too far to the point of incoherency? That techno track that should have just ended on minute 7:37? That’s your food experience at Horvath. A culinary attempt that fails on its own premises. You see, when things pretend to be something else, when food and dishes try to musk themselves and create a whole new experience, there are two options: they are either exceptionally interesting and mind-blowing or fall under their own weight into a bland, unsatisfactory mash of mushrooms.   No matter how many abstractions we will make, how post-modern we may be, a cucumber can not be a Sirloin, and a carrot is just a carrot.   In the end, Horváth fails. The food leaves you empty, unsatisfied, and mainly wondering what if: what if the chef tried to make actual food, and not abstractions of food concepts?  A word must be written about the Chocolate Sorbet 'Hunter Style': I've never had such a catastrophic dessert in a fine dining restaurant. Never.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r863649972-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html,2,en

We have visited many times over several years before Corona and this was our first visit after the pandemic restrictions have been lifted. The restaurant has been recently renovated removing some of the cozy atmosphere in favour of a more international look. Unfortunately this also has affected the acoustics so it can be quite noisy. The service is very good and friendly, However, this time the food did not resonate with us. The first amuse was lukewarm milk with butter - not good. This also goes for the desert of roasted carrots with caramelised fish broth.

The wines were all from the same regions as the food; they might have been good vines for where they come from, but neither of the countries are wine powerhouses.

2023-04-01,chloe k,"Creatively delicious experience. 6 course menu which is tailored and as a vegetarian I have never been treated as well in a fancy restaurant. They had to create a course for me because they had planned a celery ravioli with wakame and I’m allergic to seaweed … It was green asparagus - one of my great favourite vegetables!  Everything was beautiful from the truffle potato mash mise en bouche to the mushroom gnocchi, the leaks in a mustard seed mousseline with some citrus (yuzu?) to the two asparagus feasts, an incredible mingling of some lemony light coulis and on the other side some kind of tawny marmalade gravy.  The cheese course was also light and fantastic : a fromage frais quenelle (mini)  As was the pudding with a secret “orange sanguine” sorbet touch at the core. Also loved the mignardises- amazing pate de fruit (not sweet) and chocolate with a ganache and of course, the two bouchées d’accueil- one with caramelized onion and the other puffed rice as a base for a creamy dollop with an Iranian spice.  Everything is delicate, and yet extremely tasty and you can discriminate each main ingredient, nothing is drowned nor forgotten but underlined or highlighted depending on the intention.  It is a variation on the range of acidity and the textures that envelop it.  Even the zataar bread was to die for.

A few of the dishes were good, some like the snails with a spinach sauce not to our taste at all. But there were 2 major problems   1 where’s the protein?  At the end of the meal I lifted my spoon and said to my wife, do you realize we ate every dish with a spoon.  No fork or knife needed for what was served and nothing other than the small bits of snail, which have no taste on there own. There was absolutely no substance to the meal and at this price you expect more. I think they know that as the bread kept coming so we weren’t hungry when we left.

The wine pairings were not particularly interesting and were such small pours we couldn’t really even enjoy the wines deeply enough as they were gone in 3 or 4 sips.  Since they do change the menu regularly, other diners might have a completely different experience. We definitely saw the effort and thought that went into each dish. We enjoyed four of the five courses, and found the snail dish not good due to the very bitter and tough herbs used to make the sauce.

2022-08-24,Wen,"The reason I wanted to eat here was because they have a focus on sustainability and I really wanted to learn more about how they implement that, to how they select their ingredients and where they source them from etc, and we were told that it would be explained to us later, but it never happened? I think it’s especially important for a fine dine restaurant to be elaborate on this part, so I found that incredibly disappointing first of all. The service from the waiter was very smooth, and I do appreciate that. However whenever dishes were served to us I felt like it was so rushed in a way. The chef himself would describe it at a very swift pace as if he's in a rush and then he'd leave in a blink of an eye. I found that a pity because it felt a bit careless in that aspect. Another thing that's a minus was when I explicitly said I'm allergic to cherries, they ended up serving me a dish with cherries in it anyway by mistake. They did kindly replace that with another dish with green beans and lemon jelly though and that was really good. But I still find it a bit messy on their part. The dishes themselves were good, but I wouldn't say they were super innovative. There was also an escargot dish that I didn't quite like, but I think escargot just isn't my thing. I had some feedback on the sauce that was accompanied with it and the chef listened but then brushed it off, I didn't really feel like it was appreciated. I did thoroughly enjoy the rest of the courses though, especially the 3rd, 4th (the green bean lemon jelly one) and the first dessert. Those were my favs! I still think it's a good restaurant, but I feel like the personal attention part is lacking, as I explained earlier. I hope this will be seen and be taken into consideration for the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r856206531-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,3,en

I had to call back, after talking to them they requested my e mail, which it was provided over the phone and even I sent them an e mail. By next day my reservation was cancelled by te restaurant. They dont have any consideration for the time change between Paris and USA. Can be a one star Michelin but certainly didnt behave like they are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r821480303-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,1,en
2021-08-20,MicheleParis,"I took a very good friend of mine last week for dinner for her birthday (Aug. 12). For dinner is only  a discovery menu in 5 courses for €75 (€120 including wine pairing), and a tasting menu in 7 courses for €95 (€155 including wine pairing). For lunch you have ""à la carte"". We opted for the 7 courses without wine pairing. It was indeed a lovely discovery. Thibaut Spiwack is the Chef and his philosophy is: local and seasonal products, waste reduction, minimal use of water and electricity, We started with a wonderful combination of tomatoes followed by an excellent mixt of Normandy beef and Southwestern duck with red fruit pickles. Then we had  amazing snails from Poitou, with its cream of herbs... it was so light! They served us after  tuna from the Bay of Biscay, marinated and grilled tataki style with Paimpol coco beans. The highlight then was the cheese with a foam and some red fruits. The first desert was a wonderful peach tart with a delicious sorbet of peaches of the grapevine. We also had a second dessert with caramel, peanuts (not really my favorite one). We loved the decoration and the blue colors of the dining room. Service is attentive and professional.  We loved the cuisine of Thibaut Spiwack. There is always a good twist of acidity which really makes the dishes very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r805055405-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2020-08-16,saltacity,"Great gourmet restaurant – simple menu with a five or seven-course menu. Service is very good, friendly and knowledgeable. Nice interior design. The different courses are interesting and for sure great to try – not all dishes are equally appealing which is ok for me. After all tastes vary. All in all, each dish I tried (including the starters) was very good – and I found 2-3 real highlights. Definitely a place of the beaten track to try out and highly recommended by me.  Prices are not cheap but totally fair by Paris standards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r765312402-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

Every part of this meal was incredible-the staff,the service,the homemade bread (wow!),the description of each course and the taste and quality of the food itself! We opted for the 5-course menu and it was filling but because the portion size was quite small it suited us. We didn’t go with the wine pairing as we had ordered a bottle prior to the meal (which was also excellent) but I am sure this would also be a good idea",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r750242802-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2019-11-17,Swiss-Flutterby,"We had dinner at ANONA. They offer 5 or 7 course (75€ or 95€) set menues (the Chef decides what you get). We also ordered the matching wine Menü with it. I love these surprise menues with many small courses as you can taste many different things...and I like to he surprised🙂  All courses were interesting (not exotic), creative and well presented. A bit surprising was that 2 of the 5 courses were desserts. I guess the chef had more dessert ideas that day. But we were happy with that. Service was very attentive and professional.

2024-10-22,Hélène G,"Ambiance, cadre: Waiters more unsympathetic than each other (except a young woman who saves the honor). Tablecloths without tablecloths, cutlery that is not changed from one dish to another... Sustainability is a good pretext! Cooking: it’s already winter! Dishes without generosity, using products found on the January stalls (it is nevertheless the full season of mushrooms, figs, grapes,...): leeks, potatoes, onions, corn, pig, place... nothing extravagant except a careful presentation (even if you must recognize a certain inventiveness to cook such products!) A dinner that ends with an unimaginative tzatziki: cucumber and Greek yogurt. And finally, never seen in a starry: you have to pay 20€ more because you don’t eat pigs! One emerges from Anona with the unpleasant Impression that for Thibaut Spiwack the turnover and margin matter more than the pleasure of the customer (addition to 3: 570€). I do not recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r974950245-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,2,en

The environment is pleasant and the service great, friendly, efficient. What really lacked was quality in the kitchen, or rather, taste!!! The appearance of the dishes is great, but definitely did not make my type of taste. Of the six tried dishes, amuse bouche plus 5 of the menu tasting, only one was very good, one good and the rest reasonable. Very good wine options in glass. The bill of more than 400 euros for a couple was excessive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r956130415-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,3,en
