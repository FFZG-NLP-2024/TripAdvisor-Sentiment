2023-04-18,RohanDook,One of the Best blind tasting menus I’ve ever had the pleasure to experience. A true Michelin experience. A very welcoming staff. The food was exceptional. Original menu. Service was out of this world. Friendly and very knowledgeable when it came to explaining each dish as well as each glass of wine paired with that particular dish. Location is breathtaking with stunning views for the summer on the terrace. Highly recommended for anyone visiting the area in and and around Lake Annecy. This restaurant and experience is second to none in the region.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3528948-d17727911-r886721966-L_auberge_De_Montmin-Montmin_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,5,en
2020-07-13,PaulineB07,"We absolutely loved our visit! The food was incredibly tasty, delicate and beautifully executed. The concept of farm to table was greatly appreciated and there was innovative use of simple ingredients together to create an explosion of flavours. We loved it!!  We had dined the previous night at a two Michelin starred restaurant and found Auberge de Montmin to actually be much nicer. If you’re looking for stuffy, stuck up and incredibly attentive to service, this might not be for you. HOWEVER, if you’re going for a more casual, homely and ultimately splendid flavours I cannot recommend this enough. The two ladies who took care of us were incredibly pleasant and friendly and the food just speaks for itself. The one thing I would advise the owners to do would be to build a proper website with an online booking system too.  Thank you for a wonderful experience and I look forward to coming back in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3528948-d17727911-r759918740-L_auberge_De_Montmin-Montmin_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,5,en

2019-09-21,Kim P,"A group of 5 dined together for lunch at this very special and recently opened family-owned restaurant. Three of us were brought by local friends who did not look at the menu before making our reservation. We have some food allergies and aversions which have resulted in a narrow choice of food options. When we arrived we found a charming patio with spectacular views.  We were seated by Sandrine (who I believe is the wife of the chef).  We were given a prix fixe menu with roughly 8 family-style courses for 38 euros per person. There was not a single item on the menu that our daughter could eat, and for me, I could eat a few things and for my husband the same.  We were also not very hungry ( I had planned to order just a small salad).  So here we were, for the next 2 + hours with a beautiful view and really not able to eat the food the sweet waitress was bringing.  I totally understand and respect what the restaurant is wanting to do and think that they are very talented and serve fresh and innovative dishes.  I just wish we would have known and would have saved this gem for another time. When the bill came, the sly friends left it for us to pay.  We essentially wasted 120 euros plus some very exquisite food, plus I felt terrible for Sandrine having to bring the wasted food back to the kitchen.  I am writing this as an apology to them and advise to those with a limited diet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3528948-d17727911-r711669657-L_auberge_De_Montmin-Montmin_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,5,en

2024-09-05,LILI,"What we see from the appetizers is that Chef Florian Favario has a sense of detail! The dishes are presented on walnut containers designed by the chef himself (incredible?). The room is intimate, our favorite style, but unfortunately a little noisy.  On the dishes there are many flowers, plants, fruits, all worked with noble products. Tomato pie could be a birthday cake, of such beauty!  The negatives: if the third star is envisaged, you will have to review the toilet... There is no special attention for an event to celebrate and the menu is not printed (for those who like to keep it as a souvenir it will be sent to you by email). The Chef is present in the room throughout the meal, but does not come to see his guests at the end. For those who love gastronomy this moment of rewarding exchange is not negligible!  The two desserts we had were almost identical in terms of taste, presentation and even texture: there is one too many that should be replaced by cuteness (which we do not have with hot drinks).  I conclude with a very positive Rating: the team! All employees are amazingly kind, welcoming and kind! They work with a smile and make this moment even more enjoyable!

2024-10-14,Susan in Toronto,Beautiful room on the second floor of a barn like structure.  The meal was excellent - we did the wine pairing as well which was very generous.  While the experience was excellent we will likely not return - did not feel it was worth the money we paid and we would have appreciated more local Ontario items on the menu.    We were provided with a menu at the end but it would have been better to have it at the beginning so you could refer to it as you were eating - the servers explained each meal but by the time they left the table we had forgotten most of the ingredients.  And the $6 charge for tea left a bad taste given what we had paid for the meal - surely the restaurant can afford to absorb that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r973893130-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en
2024-10-05,cctyu68,"With weather still unseasonably warm and comfortable, it is nice to take advantage and venture outside of the normal GTA core for an occasional chowdown or two. For me, PM is the only trusted out-of-town, fine dining establishment featuring a tasting menu option that is within reasonable driving distance from home. Most of all, their offering reflects the quintessential in ‘ farm-to-table’ dining, incorporating a total culinary package that is always consistent, assuring and exceptional…..and now the trademark of a double Michelin Red and Green stars recipient!  It has been almost a year since I last drove out to PM and savored the wonderful and ever-changing creative cuisine of PM’s ‘ dynamic duo chefs ‘ - Daniel Hadida and Eric Robertson…….not to mention visiting their flocks of free range chicken and ducks, grass fed cattles and the impressive vegetable and herb garden!  For the past three decades, due to the close proximity of our birthdays, my brother-in-law and I had been holding regular annual, husband-only, joint birthday bashes at different venues all over Ontario and Quebec. Fine dining establishments with tasting menus and wine pairing offerings were our preferred venue options. This year, meeting our primary criteria with ease, we decided to pay PM a long overdue re-visit! Our luncheon culinary experience started off with a walk around the restaurant complex, a close encounter with some free-run ‘ Silken Chicken ‘ and a sampling of Chardonnay grapes from the 2024 harvest! Very ripe and sweet! IMHO, it could be a very good vintage year!  As in the past, after climbing the challenging ‘32 steps‘ flight of stairs to the spectacular upper level dining room, we were welcomed warmly by both chefs, outside of the open-kitchen. This time, with added significance, since we are shaking hands with Michelin star chefs!  In light of growing health and safety concerns, we have decided to pass on the wine pairing option. In lieu of, we both settled for a glass of their house-special Champagne plus a glass of their very aromatic, 2019 ‘ Irreverance ‘ ( Orange Riesling, Chardonnay & Gewurztraminer ). The creative dishes of our 12-course ‘Omakase’ tasting menu were visually impressive and relishing. The masterful menu was well thought of and conceived, featuring a balanced and diverse offering of dishes with a focus on seafood and pasture raised fowls and animals. Most dishes feature major components with complex and multidimensional taste profiles, augmented with an interesting array of vegetable sides. The ‘ too beautiful to disturb and eat ‘ artful plating elevated to an even higher level than before. Again, some never before seen or tasted, uncommon ‘organic‘ ingredients adorned our plates ( eg., local ‘Golden’ Strawberries, ‘Autumn’ Petit Pois! )……the advantage of owning a herb/vegetable garden and close proximity to local farms! To reflect their recipient of the Green Star, I was told by the chefs, ALL ingredients used from now on, especially the vegetables, will be organically grown either in-house or locally. The protein, local, organic, wild or free run!  Coupled with impeccable, warm and friendly front-of-house service and care, our near perfect meal was once again foodie and praise worthy. My ONLY very minor and superficial criticism pertains to the slight ‘overhanded‘ use of salt in the delectable sauces of a few dishes….the Lobster, the Cod and the Duck. No big deal! Part of living in an imperfect world!!  Looking forward to returning for the Fall menu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r972722789-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en

Service as would be expected excellent, attentive, very knowledgeable staff, professional yet friendly and relaxed. Happy to talk at the table with confidence. Dishes were presented by both chefs and servers, i love to see the kitchen involved in the service, all showed pride and excitement with their food.  Worth noting no full bar only a limited range of certain spirits... no mixers. However you go to PM for the food, ranked in Top 5 restaurants in Canada so I had high expectations and as Jools had visited in Summer last year and been blown away, I was expecting something special. Did i get it?? Sorry, not quite. Yes there were 3 or 4 real stand out dishes of the 10 course tasting menu, but it just did not live up to the hype. Was it due to it being winter and the seasonal produce available?  Look, experience was still very good, just not great. Stand outs... Bision Tartare, wow, melt in the mouth, lovely flavor. Nubian Goat, tender, strong flavor. Rasberry Sobet in Meringue, gapow!! Intense flavor, crispy meringue.  But then course 10, a ""Babka"", a nice Babka but what was it doing at the end of the meal, too heavy, poor menu planning, I'd have left it as a nine course tasting menu.

Rated in the top 100 restaurants in Canada the last couple of years, however did they pull that off with the meal we were served!?? Drunk food critiques? Paid off food critiques?? From start to finish we had excellent service! Provided you could hear them or understand them explaining the dishes they served you. A 10 course meal, I had my friend all hyped up about this new restaurant for her to try……unfortunately I felt embarrassed for bring her there for an evening that was suppose to be a magical food experience but still was an expensive comedy relief for us to enjoy each others company and guess which one of the servers cooked the dish that was being served to us! For it certainly could not possibly been a chef!  Possible a chef with a head cold because there was very little flavour in anything! The pork dish served was so tough you had a hard time cutting it and then chew chew chew …. A dish served with “Hogget” what is Hogget you may ask? It is a lamb that is to be between 12-18 months old….my guess it was old enough to vote! It was so tough you could not cut it, and then it came down to chew and swallow , or chew and spit out! A dish with Geoduck in it ….unfortunately mine had a bit of grit in it, probably sand….flash back of sand box at preschool …. There was not one dish that you would say OMG that was incredible! Although I did get my friend to say it by asking her to close her eyes when tasting one of the sauces and said picture campbells cream of mushroom soup, to which she replied OMG the chef must be standing back laughing his ass off at all these people eating this campbells soup! To which we both burst out laughing. Thank goodness we could laugh because at a price tag of $492 for the two of us , with no alcohol …we needed some humor for the wasted evening! If you could live on sour dough bread you will make out fine! The bread was the best part of the meal, and had most of the flavour!

The food was tasty, beautifully presented, and appropriately priced for what it was but nothing made me think omg, this is the best thing ever. When we do a tasting menu like this, I expect at least one of those moments. there was also a missed opportunity for an amuse bouche and final dinner sweet with the bill which is pretty standard for meals like this, in my experience. The service was wonderfully friendly, but not stellar -- towards the end of the meal we had three sets of empty wine glasses on the table which wasn't terrible, but not expected for a venue of this quality and reputation.  I have to comment on the wine pairings because I tried to get some advance info on them from reviews and wasn't very successful. If money is no object, by all means it was interesting and I'm sure we tasted some things we'd not find elsewhere. But 6 2oz glasses of wine which were tasty and well matched, but not exceptional, for $135 is nuts. We didn't look at the regular wine menu because this was a special occasion and we'd decided in advance to do the pairings,  so I can't say what wine by the glass (or even bottle) cost, but my recommendation would be to have a look at the wine menu and get the sommelier to suggest 2 or 3 glasses to match the menu. The space itself is lovely and spacious, and having service included in the prices is a really nice touch. Again, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience -- it was a lovely night out, and I have no regrets, but it was not a life changing meal, and I've had those for a similar or lower price. I hope this is helpful for anyone who is waffling about making a reservation or choosing to go with the wine pairings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r893930315-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,4,en

Will definitely return in the Summer to experience more from Chefs Hadida and Robertson.  Telling you what we had will not help, as by the time you go it will have changed.

2023-01-28,DGW,"Pearl Morissette is located 2nd floor. It has a nice ambiance, with tables nicely spaced. The service was impecable with every member of the staff being knowledage and attentive, without being """"hovering"". We had the 10 course sampler, and each couple shared a wine pairing. Having the 10 course sampler meant you tried dishes what you may not normally order. An example was the Sea Urchin, which was a favourite.   Similarly with the wine, you got to try some Italian white wines which we did not knew existed.

2022-10-27,travellingdining,"This is Pearl Morissette's last month outdoors under their tent and we were glad to have experienced it. Prepared for a chilly evening, we found the tent to be pleasantly warm (even without the available blankets) and very inviting. What was greenery spreading over the ceiling in summer, is now delicately dried and brown--but it suits the fall weather and candlelit atmosphere.  Servers and staff are well-trained and attentive, pleasant and very accommodating. Due to an allergy at our table (they asked at time of booking), the kitchen had prepared special dishes without certain ingredients (eggs & milk). In one case, the altered dish was better than the original!  That said, all the food was terrific-- imaginative, complementary flavour combinations created using as much local product as possible, including many ingredients grown on the farm surrounding the restaurant. Even with ingredients like sablefish (aka black cod) which can sometimes have an overwhelming taste, the fusion of flavours was excellent.  The wine list is extensive, although we opted for the wine pairing. Our sommelier was well-versed and interested in giving us the best experience possible. She even changed up one pairing to something she thought we would better enjoy, based on our comments as dinner went on. Over all, this was a beautiful evening and one we greatly enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r866192281-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en

The ambiance and atmosphere was not there, and the service from the various 9-10 people who came to our table was inconsistent and weird. The price point is very high and you may as well pit stop for pizza on your way home because it is not a filling 9 course. There are much better restaurants to spend $250$+ per person. Also the bathrooms are literally outside in a trailer.

2022-10-20,Jane W,"Pearl Morissette is topnotch. The tasting menu could be considered pricey, but it is  more than worth it. Their dishes are creative, the flavour combinations are unique and the plating is lovely. The wine pairings are perfect; a combination of local and international vintages were excellent complements to the food. The servers are polite, unobtrusive and pleasant. Such care is taken with allergies (they ask in advance), that the chefs redesign some dishes to accommodate food sensitivities at a particular table.  We ate outdoors in the enclosed tent, which was comfortable and warm, despite the near freezing weather that night. Minimalist decor with an emphasis on plants and nature were the perfect setting for the meal which relies heavily on local ingredients, especially those grown on the farm immediately outside. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r865300924-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en

We all wholeheartedly agree with everything the previous reviewer Nanap777 submitted therefore there is no sense reinventing the wheel!!   However we would like to add that we were dismayed to discover that the toilets were outside and were basically slightly upgraded Porta-Potties.

2022-08-23,Nanap777,"I really wanted to give this restaurant a good review and waited a week after visit to “process” the experience. Although it was good overall, it just didn’t meet our expectations. To me a good restaurant is a place where you would want to go back and I can’t say that I want to return to Pearl Morissette. I’m a foodie and unfortunately this experience was just a check mark on my “bucket list”.  Good service and great atmosphere, very romantic. The food portions were small. I mean really small. One of the courses was two tiny baby potatoes. I don’t expect a place like that to have big portions, but you do want to feel at least half satisfied after a meal. We though since it was nine course meal we’d feel different towards the end but then the deserts came and we were disappointed.  I’m very picky when it comes to food and I liked most dishes but there were few that I didn’t. The duck was a bit too rare, very chewy. It is just my opinion but all four of us thought ot would be nice if it was cooked just a bit longer.  I feel bad giving this place 3 star review because had good time. But on the other hand after 4 months wait and the most expensive meal I’ve ever had I feel there is something missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r855914932-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,3,en

2024-10-16,Sightsee35489831140,"Booked as a treat well in advance during a holiday trip to Northumberland. Saturday is the only lunch service they offer. Located in an airy upstairs space in a converted barn with 8 or so tables facing an open kitchen where 5 chefs worked away. The tasting menu comprises something like 18 courses; many of which are single bite expediences, Each course was served by one of the chefs team explaining the ingredients  and techniques behind it. They were all very friendly and approachable an we had some extended conversations about a range of topics. The food is very clever, original and inventive as well as being tasty and enjoyable. All in all a great experience with a very committed and passionate brigade seeking to create new flavours in the wilds of Northumberland. A lot of produce comes from the kitchen garden and two polytunnels with produce grown and selected by the chefs themselves. very friendly and efficient waiting staff. We were there for 3 hours 20 minutes and the food is very well paced.

2024-09-13,Never2Old,"Visited Restaurant Pine to celebrate Tim’s 60th birthday as a couple.  The meal at Restaurant Pine was as perfect as we had hoped it would be. Such a magical experience. Granted, you have to be a foodie and perhaps watch Master Chef on repeat to appreciate the creativity, expertise and talent involved in each impeccable course. The photographs and each title of the over 18 item course menu does not do the food justice but please have a gander. Every morsel was filled with expertly sourced flavour - sometimes unusual and, most of the time, foraged from the local environment. I couldn’t keep up with the amount of wild plants that  were included. Even the menu can be planted in the garden to release the wild flower seeds within.  Here are photos of BBQ Shiso and Sugar Kelp - you  have to put the whole think in your mouth and it just bursts with flavour; Berwick Edge, Dry Aged Carrot and Horseradish - same pop in mouth technique and the carrot has the texture of meat. It has taken months to prepare; Asparagus, Sunflower and Sorrell - first of the season and gorgeous - caramelised sunflower seeds on a bed of miso cream with sorrell leaves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r969647903-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en

The restaurant itself is in beautiful Northumberland and from the restaurant you have countryside views all around.   The kitchen is open and it was a privilege to watch the chef team prepare the incredible menu. The precision and skill on display was amazing.

2024-07-17,Turia,"Visited here while walking the Hadrian’s Wall Path which passes through East Wallhouses. My companion, being an avid follower of the Great British Menu and Cal Byerley, was overjoyed to discover this restaurant was so close to where we were staying one night and insisted on taking me to experience some top quality fine dining. I must admit I was initially reluctant due to the price. However, I was completely blown away by the whole experience. We were met at the door by a friendly lady and spent a pleasant time in the cozy bar where the Sommelier helped us choose some wine. All very laid back and relaxed and no one seemed perturbed by me wearing my (clean) walking gear. The restaurant is a good size for the small number of tables which are well spaced out with the open kitchen in the corner. It was fascinating to watch the chefs creating each dish, sometimes it seemed like a ballet was taking place in the kitchen. Each dish was introduced and explained in detail as it was delivered to the table. This was my first experience of a tasting menu and I must say that every dish was fantastic. The presentation, flavour and texture of the food was incredible. Even the bread and butter were the best I have ever tasted. Many of the dishes were an interpretation of something familiar but in an original and unique way, providing some real insight into what food can be like. I was certainly impressed. The atmosphere in the restaurant remained relaxed throughout with attentive but not intrusive front of house staff.

You have a clear view of the open kitchen meaning you can enjoy watching these talented chefs.   I can confirm the food was out of this world, flavoursome, unique and very enjoyable. The wine pairing I had has to be one of my very favourites I’ve ever had, the knowledge and enjoyment I got from the wonderful Vanessa was second to none. She really knows her stuff.

2024-06-27,Sarahanne08,"We choose Pine as a result of watching Cal on the Great British Menu. We wanted to know more about Restaurant Pine because we were  inspired by their approach to producing great food. We wanted to have the whole experience so included wine pairing and we were not disappointed.  Pine was a treat for my birthday and from start to finish the experience was  without doubt a memorable experience.  Previous positive reviews discuss the quality, presentation and ambiance and we concur with their views. Its such a relaxed, friendly place that you feel so much at home.  We had our favourite courses, including, Wild Sea Trout, Dried Aged Carrot & Horseradish, King Edwards Potato, Sour Dough Bread, Beetroot, Doddington Cheddar & Walnut , etc. Maybe I just say what my least favourite tastes were. So you are probably getting the impression it was a fantastic menu. However, least favourite is just based on personal taste.  I think what really enhanced our experience was our wine sommelier's. They explained the reasoning behind the choice of wine, history and location. We know a little bit about wine, but we learnt so much.  We sat at the chef table and had a lovely opportunity to watch the team prepare the the courses. They are so organised and it was a pleasure to watch. I would love to have them on Christmas Day.  The icing on the cake was the lovely birthday card signed by all the team and Peach Cake which was a lovely gift for my birthday. The experience in terms of value for money is subjective. We felt it was great value for money based on the in-depth preparation of the ingredients to support the each individual course . We will visit again next year. Thank you to the whole team.

It is hidden in a farm industrial complex 8 miles from Newcastle on Hadrians wall , not a normal spot for a top end eating establishment ….but without any shadow of a doubt this is top end in terms of imaginative , clever , often brilliant cooking .  You are taken on a journey of sustainable ingredients throughout the menu which never stops giving in terms of bursts of flavour …….with lots of surprises .   Simple ingredients,  locally sourced can produce extraordinary dishes …..the bbq bream , the King Edward potato dish , the Hogget broth , the Scallop dish the honeycomb desert all totally fantastic and I could mention many more things I loved .  But a good eating place needs a good vibe and a great atmosphere and the team at Pine are a great bunch of people , a great team led by Sian and Cal ……..but the rest of the team all play there part everyone showing great knowledge and all the food and wine and very friendly and welcoming .

2024-03-19,The Bradcotts,"We have had Pine on our radar for some time now and whilst recently staying in the area we were fortunate to secure a dinner table.  We arrived on a cool, damp, miserable March evening to be warmly welcomed in the parking area by a charming young lady who escorted us to a delightful cosy lounge.  Vanessa, the Sommelier, guided us through the eclectic drinks selection. I particularly enjoyed a pre dinner local wheat beer. Throughout the meal, at Vanessa's suggestion, I enjoyed some quite tasty and unusual reds from Turkey and Greece.  My wife enjoyed an Austrian Gruner Veltliner and a white Pinot Noir from Surrey.  In the dinning area we were seated directly in front of the open plan kitchen where we were able to observe the creation of our extensive culinary adventure.  We were close enough in fact for the two chefs (Ian and colleague) to present and describe each dish at our table.  We've lost count of how many wonderful courses we had, but our favourites, in no particular order, were Pork Chump with Salsify; Snow Ball Turnip; Potato with Cucumber Concentrate and Scallop with Cauliflower and Pear.  The 'piece de resistance' however was the Hogget which we were able to observe the chef nurturing throughout the first half of our meal.  In conclusion, an outstanding experience spread over three hours.  We look forward to our next visit.

2024-02-21,Simon M,This is a small restaurant on a farm. It's quite small which adds to the occasion. This was our second visit and if it's possible it was even better than our first visit. The food is excellent as is the service. Several of the small courses used unusual combinations to superb effect. The kitchen staff as well as the head chef interact with the diners giving an immersive experience. The service was very friendly. We'll definitely be going back.

2024-02-06,Guys Who Dine,"Dinner Restaurant Pine Northumberland. This restaurant has been on our list for a while. What can be said about this modern venue on a farm? Well, it's multi award winning.  The dining option is a tasting menu of dreams. Menus are reconstituted to make paper and are sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring. All dishes are prepared and served from an open kitchen. We were lucky enough to have a table right in front of all the action.  Service starts with some of the most-mouth watering snacks after snacks before you even get to the bread course. Then comes the Pork Jowl, Celeriac & Preserved Berries,Pork Bone Broth & Hen of the Woods. OMG,we're not even halfway yet. The fish course was a delightful Monkfish, White Asparagus & Sunflower. The main course was Roe-Deer, Larch. Black Garlic & Gooseberry. Followed by desserts.  The evening doesn't stop there. You are invited into the bar where you can order after dinner drinks and served a trio of sweet treats. Pace of service was very slick and well orchestrated, which lasted no longer than three hours. Yes,it's fine dining on a very high level on a farm and an experience that will be memorable for a long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r937049953-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en

Staff were not intrusive but on hand for the smallest requirement, always a very good sign. Great interaction with staff on the food and wine with a great knowledge and able to answer all the questions.

2024-01-02,Guido-Sol,"A converted old barn in a windswept Northumberland field 14 miles from Newcastle Upon Tyne isn’t traditionally where you’d expect to find a fine dining experience. The restaurant and bar are beautifully crafted.   The agricultural roots of this old barn are still evident, but not negatively so. The dining room is bright, airy and spacious thanks to a vaulted ceiling high overhead, and pride of place is given to the open kitchen, where chefs busy themselves carefully tweezering dishes.  It’s clear that this is a restaurant that cares about the smallest things. Even the menus are a work of art - old menus are reconstituted to make paper for new menus, and sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring.  The menu is clever in the sense there’s a gradual building of flavour and clear consideration of quantity and pacing.  Service is charming, in a way that makes everything feel effortless and never too much trouble. From front to back. Every dish is explained in exquisite detail. We selected the wine pairing which was brilliantly presented with incredible enthusiasm by the sommelier Vanessa.    In conclusion a very enjoyable evening, delicious food completed by some delightful wine pairings.   Tip.  Don’t worry about securing a taxi for the homeward journey because the staff will take care of everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r932022783-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en
2023-12-11,Simon C,"4 of us visited for the vegetarian tasting menu and it was a 3 and a half hours of exceptional food - no short changing the veggies with filler dishes here! So much detail and preparation was evident  with locally sourced  and home grown ingredients which had been dehydrated, fermented and prepared in some cases over months!  The flavours were in some cases just so intense with the beetroot, the charcuterie butternut and the extraordinary parsnip deserts a few of the many highpoints... the wine flight was indeed a flight of exploration  with Vanessa... Welsh wine...who knew? And the soft drink parings for those not drinking a great and again unusual list of really interesting and delightful flavours...  Finally with the open kitchen and the Great service with all the staff and chefs taking turns to talk through the drinks and food just a great experience....thanks to Sian ,Cal,Ian and Vanessa and the rest of your team.

2023-12-18,El Turista John,"First of all, the Wolf’s Tailor was 5 of 5 for food, 5 of five drinks pairing (both wine and non-alcoholic) and 5 of 5 for service. So why not a 5 overall, because for the price and the Michelin Star one doesn’t expect them to forget to deliver a course. Got home, looked at the printed menu they gave us of our meal and  realized one of the dessert courses ( Mignardise) was never plated for our table of 3. And, if you go on their website both places where you click to get in touch are inoperative. So this is the only place I can provide feedback. Which is a poor way to end such an excellent meal and certainly cheapens the value-for-money.  As to the food, WOW!!  The fresh, unique, flavorful, and creative dishes were world class. In the dozens and dozens of Michelin starred restaurants I’ve been to I’ve never had a tartare course, wagyu course or scallop course that tasty and unique. Bravo!!  The wine and non-alcoholic beverages were also superstars of the dining experience. Each wine certainly enhanced the food courses. Our designated driver’s non-alcoholic pairings were the envy of the table. SUPERB!  The wait staff was always professional, friendly and attentive. And the welcome and send off from the chefs as we passed the kitchen was a nice touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r930165383-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,4,en

2023-05-17,LoafJugThouTree,"Oh, my. We ate at Tavernetta and concluded that it couldn't get much better. WRONG! The Wolf's Tailor is A M A Z I N G. We selected the five-course ""Entrust"" menu. Each course was astoundingly good. I'm sure each course had a name of some kind, but neither my wife nor I can remember what. What we can remember is the description of each dish. Complex? Oh my, yes. And many of the ingredients are provided by a certified forager. The first course, as an example, was almost inedible. Why? The dish looked so beautiful, it was truly a work of culinary art. Eat it? I didn't even want to disturb it! But I did and, no surprise, the tastes were gorgeous. The tab for this glorious menu was $110 per person plus the 22% service fee. Realistically, given what one has to pay for feed-lot beef and poorly cooked vegetables in a steakhouse, $110 per person is a bargain. Actually, given the venue, food, and service, it's a HUGE bargain. Reserve early. It's sold out just about every night.

2023-01-31,JB4854,"The food and service at Wolf Tailor were excellent, but this is not a $$-$$$ dollar restaurant. It is at the very highest end. It is a price fixed restaurant and our bill for two was over four hundred dollars including tip and one drink each. A great experience but our pocketbook certainly won’t permit a second experience. Besides the hefty tab (there is no menu and we had no idea of the cost; we should have asked and they should have told us), it was very cold in the restaurant. Several customers wore there jackets. My wife and I used ours to keep our legs warm. They offered blankets, which indicated they knew it was cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r877055947-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,4,en
2023-01-05,Noel D,"What a wonderful dining experience! The tasting menu we experienced was the buckwheat theme, and it was exquisite. Taste, presentation, and innovation were out of this world. There are 7 courses and we left full but not miserably stuffed. The first course was small bites including a buckwheat donut topped with caviar and a sauce that was out of this world. I had venison that was so tender it would melt in your mouth, made-from-scratch soba noodles, buckwheat flatbread with a duck liver pate topping, and amazing desserts. I hate fish and seafood, but I wanted to be adventurous, and I'm so glad I was. There were two courses with fish, and I gobbled them up. All of their ingredients are sourced locally.  Service was fantastic--attentive, thoroughly explained each course, made great drink recommendations to pair with the courses.  Well worth the expense for a special occasion and major foodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r874026800-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,5,en
2022-09-08,Michael Meyer,"We absolutely loved the experience, food, and the wait staff.  I chose this spot for my wife's birthday dinner, and I stated that on our reservation. The female Somalia was incredible, concise, knowledgeable, and beyond professional. Exactly the caliber of staff I would expect from a ""culinary experience""   The start to the night was not ideal, the male waiter we had was very nice, professional, and on top of it. For the start of the experience though, I would say they need more training.  I pre-purchased our dinner, and drinks. When he approached us, he asked if we had been there before. We answered no, and he began running through how the ordering experience is and such, I cut in and explained I ordered everything ahead of time. I was surprised that he was not aware of that before coming to the table,   (I would recommend recording that information and adding it to the reservation to improve the experience for the customer, or make that apart of your spiel)  After the first interaction   He came back with our water and stated ""oh yes you did, would you like to put those drinks in?"" which added to our confusion. I asked him ""I paid for the mixed drinks and food ahead of time, I thought this was all paired together for the taste"" His response was ""oh you can put in something else too, and your other drinks will come out once we get started""   Naturally I asked, when do we get started? He responded ""whenever you are ready""   At this point I was a little frustrated as there was a lack of ""setting the stage"" and small details were being left out.   I asked for a proper overview, felt better after that, but the impression was made.   At this point I was hopeful it would get better, and the rest of the experience? Incredible. The male waiter from here was on top of EVERYTHING, didn’t miss a single beat. The others were all very knowledgeable and helpful.   The final dish was the dessert, we personally did not like it very much but it was interesting. I would have preferred to swap #7 with #5 as #5 (if I'm remembering the number right) would have made a savory finish, but who cares what I think and it was all incredible.   My wife and I are not big holiday and birthday people, we like to celebrate quietly with one another and we really appreciate that the staff did not make a big deal out of it as I forgot to leave a note to keep it a quiet affair.  Really appreciate the candle and no singing!    The ambiance:  I chose the patio/garden as I thought it would be the coolest/cutest. It was not what I expected, I expected a quieter more romantic setting.  To set the stage, you have to enter through the patio/garden instead of the front door. The garden area has fresh herbs they are growing that are actively used in the meals. Which is awesome! However because you need to enter through here, people are constantly coming and going. There are some tents for some privacy, but we did not get one and sat next to some people that were pleasant enough, but a little loud and played stuff over their phones a couple times. It was unfortunately distracting.   The way I read about Wolfs Tailor was a romantic culinary experience, and it is beyond a doubt a wonderful experience, however I will say if you're expecting a romantic couples dinner for a one on one like experience, you and your partner will just have to be the people that block others out. We did and had a great time, I just wish the experience was more so nurtured   Also the speaker above one of the tables was too loud, they were happy to turn it down, but one of those things. I also found that the music was poorly chosen for the ambiance, too loud and aggressive.  It was rhythmic and interesting, but not the right setting. For example I personally love metal music, but I wouldn't play it at a house party as it's not the right setting.   I would say overall it’s a 8/10 experience that had some detractors, the staff, food, and drinks all made it worth it.  Final take aways and .02c   Instruct your staff to set the stage for the experience better Softer music choice, less volume on that speaker as it kept my ears ringing for the night Garden seating could be a bit darker, or create more seclusion",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r859117015-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,4,en
2022-09-05,TessDC,"Celebrating a wedding anniversary, a birthday, and a visit from family members all rolled into one spectacular night.  We did the entrust tasting menu with wine pairings. I didn't think anything could top the bento box but all seven courses were equally spectacular. Of the wine pairings, I only disliked one wine (everyone else loved it). I even liked the chardonnay - perfectly paired with the amazing pasta and homemade bread - and I don't normally like chardonnay.   Service was top-notch from the moment we walked in. I loved how we got a short discussion about the food and wine with each course.   We left informed, spoiled, the exact right amount of tipsy (but not me as the DD!), full but not overly so, and happy as two clams at high tide.   We packed a lot of events and food in while my foodie B and S-In-L were in town, and this was the highlight of the week for us all.  Photos are subpar and we were so excited to dive into every new plate that we forgot a few.   Well worth the cost for the extra happiness on my family's faces.

2021-09-15,Merlin C,"How might a wolf choose to dress himself, given the opportunity? A tuxedo to hide his ferocity? Perhaps that’s the very idea at The Wolf’s Tailor. An unassuming look to hide Denver’s finest meal.   We were in town celebrating a very special occasion called life. We arrived at dusk and walked to the back of the restaurant, passing greenhouses and gardens. We checked-in and began a well-choreographed procession. Things flowed at The Wolf’s Tailor: time, food, alcohol, and happiness. We started off with whiskey highballs. They were light and fresh and made with a Suntory sparkling water machine. A whiskey cocktail that’s astonishingly refreshing. Tell me the last time you had one of those. Seriously, tell me about it. I’d love to try it because this one was delightful.  One of us got the wine pairing, while the other got the cocktail pairing. It’s hard not to make this review a Shakespear novel, so I’ll just say the drinks were phenomenal. A drink I still daydream about had green chartreuse, cold pressed pineapple juice syrup, and more of that Suntory sparkling water I keep hearing so much about. Highlights from the omakase were the roast chicken meatballs (pure Roy Choi!), the huckleberries fermented in sake for 7 days (what happens after 7 days? No one knows!), and the everything bagel naan (you read that right!).   Skewered spot prawns would have stolen the show if not for halibut served in a lime, citrus broth that resembled pho with fresh dill atop. The halibut may have been poached for all I know. Good grief, let me come back and try it again please! My tuxedo hid nothing. I drank the broth like a savage because it was too pleasing to let go. I ate the rest of my partner’s halibut and drank their broth after mine. I had become the wolf.   Somewhere amid this dizzying comfort of taste and fullness, we had homemade rigatoni made from house milled grains, and a buffalo tartare that deserves its own essay, and somewhere after all that I believe I ate a deconstructed dessert after a constructed dessert. Dessert after dessert. We’d gone too far to stop. We can never stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r810164932-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,5,en

Out of the tasting menu the pasta course was my least favorite, but I'm not a big pasta fan, but that in no way meant it was bad. I really enjoyed the Asian inspired dishes. Good sake pairing. The ambiance is great  - there's a year-round outdoor fire pit out front that is a nice gathering place even in winter time. Had a great server that was the appropriate amount of attentive.

The wait staff described each item to a tee and they were friendly and appeared to really enjoy their jobs. The pasta we had was the hit of the night for us but also the desserts blew us away.

We took the long menu and Jesús Sanchez led us with a ""in crescendo"" thread to the end. Starting with his appetizers and the pintxos reinterpreted modernizing the classics. His cocido and a series of dishes with the master's brushstrokes that gently lead you to his work with the bonito, the grouper, the carrot game and his spectacular pigeon. His dishes are beautiful while he manages to bring out the intense flavour of the products.

2019-11-17,voyager5017,Superb place. I had not been in a few years - they have since gained another star by Michelin to make it a 2 star. I was truly surprised and delighted by the creativity and improvements across the board- from the dining space which has been massively upgraded and renovated to the food itself which was truly a delight. The chef was charming when he visited the tables and truly warm. The Sommalier gave us superb recommendations that do not break the bank. A must do on a culinary drive across north Spain for sure.

2019-08-18,berdafina,"Very high quality, luxurious, outstanding. Fully deserves its two Michelin stars. No regrets here.   All the food is excellent : very refined and light, tasty, varied. With exceptionally good dishes such as : Consommé of Morcilla tapa;  main course of Pigeon stuffed with leak & mushroom, on a mixed vegetable base, in a rich sauce, with mustard, broccoli trunk & soufflé potatoes; and a pre-dessert of citric Passion Fruit and Yogurt Ice-cream stuffed with Mango and Apple.  Only small complaints, the exploding mustard balls with the pigeon, and the slightly heavy Raviole starter.   All the glasses of wines proposed with the menu are very good.   High calibre service, plentiful staff, and warm welcome. Although the head waiter can come over as a bit as tense and cold. For example, not offering an aperitif upon arrival.   Before arriving at your table, one is offered an original tour of the manor, including through the wine cellar and its own bakery, with a visit to two different salons for aperitifs.   Relaxing atmosphere, in a very nice, interesting building, leaving an impression of tradition with a modern touch. Well spaced tables, and well frequented that lunch-time. Although the air-conditioning is rather too cool.

2017-09-03,DuchessadiNapoli,"We need an English commentary here as Google translations are incomprehensible. FOR: This restaurant deserves its Michelin stars: the cuisine is excellent. The staff are attentive. The place is impressive,the building historic. If you are a gourmet, or a professional food expert/writer, you will probably enjoy this experience. AGAINST: The cuisine is complex. Nothing is simple. Dishes are served in small elegant portions - don't come here if you are hungry, or suffer from a healthy appetite! Be prepared for a large bill: elegance has its price. The staff is very attentive and polite but service is slow: over two hours for lunch may be enjoyed by some, but for older people it can be an ordeal. Service is choreographed: I find it over the top and would prefer a more down-to-earth approach. If I want choreography I go to the ballet. The building is in an out-of-the-way village which is badly signposted. We drove for miles - be sure to have an efficient sat nav. The very historic building needs better lighting at the entrance: ancient stone slabs and unlit steps may be authentic but are dangerous.

2016-08-10,Stevendlv,"In a village just off the main roads one can find the beautiful Centador de Amos. There is the event location on the far end of the property that I can only imagine to be a dream wedding location. There is plenty of parking space and there are hosts waiting to welcome you into the venue. It makes you feel right at home and it is immediately clear that this will be a treat. As we did not speak Spanish they made sure there was always someone who spoke english to ensure we could comfortably ask any question and were offered an English menu.   We started with a choice of one of the set menus outside in the lounge where we chose the middle menu “Esencia” (75E IVA included). We were taken to a bigger room inside where a few other tables were already enjoying their lunch. The tables were well spaced for enough privacy and every guest seemed to feel just as much of a special guest. The servers made their best effort to make some small talk, but were mostly very unobtrustive and were right there anytime you would like something or even right before. The timing was great for every dish and the teamwork was astonishing.   The food was amazing, especially the amuses and appetizers were out of this world. The “Caramelized Foie”, “Coastal Tuna” were among my personal highlights as well as the regional favourite of Sardines only this time in a modern setting. All the dishes were quite a large portion so don’t worry about going home hungry.. Also because of the bread that was supplied which also tasted amazing. I won’t give away too much on the contents as the tastes were quite surprising but never unpleasant. After the dinner we were seated in the sun in the lounge again and enjoyed some great complimentary petits fours with our espresso.   Certainly recommended. At least at the higher-end of the one star spectrum well worth the time to travel here and the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r403695810-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html,5,en
2015-10-30,Bryan C,"We booked this restaurant for lunch on a Thursday during our holiday to Cantabria. The restaurant was empty apart from us but it didn't feel like it. The staff were great with our dreadful Spanish and complete lack of understanding of Spanish cuisine. The place has a lovely balance of old and new.  So, the food. For starters my daughter (11) and I both had the cod salad which was basically raw cod, which had been 'cooked' in lemon juice. The eleven year old wolfed it down declaring it 'wonderful'. My if had a cocido or bean stew which had the most int nose flavour either of us had come across. For mains, my daughter had a poached hake dish which was perfectly cooked. My wife went for chicken with black rice, while I ordered what I had expected to be a beef stew of some kind, but turned out to be tripe and possibly lungs; it was gorgeous. The only reason all plates were not wiped clean was that the portions were very generous. For dessert we had a meille feuille, and two apple tarts.  The Wien list, as you would expect is extensive, but priced remarkably fairly. Strong representation from most Spanish regions including Mallorca which was a surprise as we haven't seen their wines outside the island before. We went for  hefty red from Toro, which I had been dying to try for ages. Prices are very reasonable as seems to be the case throughout Cantabria.  All in all a fabulous meal in lively surroundings. The dishes were traditional regional fare but given a twist or made special. This is a fantastic restaurant and we would like to thank the staff who took the time to explain things to us. Next time I'll pay more attention when they say 'tripe'. It wasn't a dish I would have chosen, but I'm very glad I had it because it was truly delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r323243778-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html,5,en
2015-08-29,David T,"""From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave this is one big enjoyable experience. I have eaten tasting menus before but the 'Experiencia' was unbelievable. Well thought out, well explained and just amazing to eat. Such a variation of tastes and quality presentation. Oh, and you will be comfortably full! The wine list is a wine lovers delight. We settled for one of the many Gran Reserva Riojas and was not disappointed. The mark ups are minimal too! The waiters were excellent. Very efficient and unobtrusive. They also spoke excellent English. Don't be afraid of taking children with you. They accommodated by producing a dish of less rich and daunting food that our 12 year old loved!!!, however, to her delight, the selection of children's pudding was from the a la carte menu and didn't disappoint. The atmosphere in some Michelin starred restaurants can be a little pretentious. Not here.

Individual changes are allowed if there are dislikes. A  selection of  appetisers came in succession, followed by a superbly fresh fish course, melt in the mouth oxtail as the main course, desert and a planchette of petit fours. The service was faultless - neither rushed nor slow. They have an incredible wine selection and we accepted their recommendation and had a terrific Rioja which was also sensibly priced.

2024-10-11,Carlos F,"I hadn’t been to Marbella bars for years and being from Santander I recognize that it made me evoke those feelings of places where chaos, haste, bad education and bland food reign.  A freshly captured anchovy quality pit sold as if it were the last liter of oil there will be in 100 years. An outdated service that can keep you waiting between dishes for more than 30 minutes. It is especially serious when they make one day after another the same menu for the whole world as chain of production of cocacola in Galdakano. Maybe some bartender slave had a cramp or the arrogance of service for saying we are local Santander produced an irreparable dislike. Feeling rejected in a 300 site for a beard is a feeling that cannot be explained. I think the priority should be to make yourself comfortable with the deal, not to accommodate the chair when you come back from the bathroom. It seemed that they had the strava installed by how they ran back and forth like headless chicken, chick stingers as they forced us to accept that they are called in Cantabria. I sincerely believe that the lack of the usual Mexican sommelier has produced a disintegration in the sanchineta. When he came to receive from us both ears the tail and the exit through the big door he refused to tell him that after 6 excellent times he was surprised with this drop in level only worried about the stab by tripavisor.

I was there for dinner with a friend (his first time to the restaurant) a couple of days ago. We both enjoyed our meal.  We took the 7-course menu. The 5 savoury dishes included 2 dishes ((a) the signature aka uni and (b) foie gras Brussels sprout) which were also served during my dinner in Amber earlier this year.   Other savoury dishes were: - Alaskan king crab  - Kinmedai (served in the kitchen where I’d the pleasure of meeting Chef Richard Ekkebus again)  - Pigeon   All of them were very delicious but the pigeon dish was by far the most impressive. The meat was of outstanding quality and cooked to perfection. It’s cooked medium rare but when I cut it there wasn’t any hint of blood. The small slice of flesh on top of the dish was very juicy and tender. Okinawa corn on the side was very sweet.   The 2 desserts weren’t bad.

The service was slow, several mistakes (it really wasn't that busy) and when we pointed the mistakes out (wrong food , wrong bill amounts) they made it seem as if it was our mistake and not theirs while they tried to sort it out. The food was all fine but only fine, given the hype they have been making about it we were expecting something special but it was all just very average.

It has a very exquisite and complex texture and the seaweed crisps on the side was a cherry on top!  It was such a great experience to enter to the kitchen and have a glance of how the magic is done.

While all savoury dishes were very delicious, the following were particularly memorable:  1. the iconic Aka Uni dish  2. Normandy scallop with winter truffle which we had in the kitchen  3. French lamb which comprised 3 different parts. The meat was perfectly cooked. It’s very tender and juicy with a unique fragrance.   The dessert wasn’t bad.

2024-01-17,Jean Helly,"My wife and I and our daughter celebrated our 20th Anniversary at Amber last night. I personnally had been for dinner and lunch before, but not my wife.  The ambiance: The restaurant was re-decorated a few years ago and the new decoration looks much better than before. Newer style, very clean, the tables are very spacious. The restaurant was only half full last night so it was also very quiet. Everything on the table was clean and tidy, as it should be with a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  The staff: The staff is well trained, very amicable and willing to chat just the right amount. The dishes were explained very clearly and my wife (who is an excellent cook herself) was able to ask questions. Getting the attention of the staff was no issue.  Visit of the kitchen: With our Full Amber Experience came a visit of the kitchen. A nice touch that we appreciated, which I don't think too many restaurants in HK offer. Our Spanish Mackerel dish was prepared before our eyes by the chef with full explanation. We then had our dish in the kitchen while the chef was explaining to us how the whole kitchen is working. A totally cool experience.  The wine list: The wine list is extensive and comparable to Restaurant Petrus for example, and more extensive than Gaddis. The markups are a little on the high side compared to other fine dining restaurants in HK. I had chosen my wine in advance and went with a 2012 Malhadinha (a red Portuguese wine) that lived up to my expextations entirely. The glasses used by the sommelier were the correct ones.  The food: The menu is an absolute masterpiece. Each dish is extremely well crafted, the ingredients used of the highest quality. The flavours are very complex and goes along very well with the presentation of the dishes. 2 things to note: - the menus are entirely sustainably sourced and Amber gets a Green Star from Michelin for this. - there is a vegetarian menu option, which my daughter ordered, and the portions are meaningfully more copious than the non-vegetarian menu, similar to my previous experience at Amber. Not an issue of course, but worth noting.  Our Anniversary dinner was a complete success, and we'll definitely come back to Amber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r934542017-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en

We liked the softer ambiance and the natural light filled space.  The dishes were meticulously put together with taste profiles as precisely executed as we could remember. We chose the “Extended Amber Experience” with four courses and it was sumptuous and satisfying.  We were delighted by the prawn consommé which was flavoursome, the tooth fish and scallop with was tender with freshness, the duck that was so gamey, while the signature Red Sea Urchin “cauliflower” lobster caviar was as memorable as our last visit.  The petit four combo was one of the most impressive with fruits, and freshly made Ying Yang (coffee and tea) mix.  Staff were professional and attentive, who explained each dish clearly; and the wine list comprehensive and advice was spot on - the range of wine-by-the-glass is large.

(Amber's progressive menu showcases pure flavours, masterful techniques and chef Richard Ekkebus's creative vision. Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt. Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)  Needless to say the guest chef Syrco created an amazing & interesting menu with the combination of Dutch & Indonesian flavours.

Mattia was also extremely accommodating with respect to our requirements and helping us sort out the bar service. They drove two hours north for our event, and cooked in an outdoor gazebo.

2024-09-17,GuillaumeTirel,"Stayed at the hotel and ate at the 3*-restaurant as well at le Cabro. Paradise one earth, any picture you take from any angle is postal-card like! I wish I had bought that house decades ago! Great wine list. Quite a large change in the cuisine from my last visit 24 months ago. I would make a special mention to a ""Corinne"" (?), a young lady from Maurice who looked after my table at  le Cabro and was only smile and kindness. That’s what we want in restaurants: we do go to eat and taste cuisine, true but in the end, the floor is what makes a meal a moment when you simply ingest food however good it can be or a moment that becomes a key souvenir you remember all your life. There are 3 key reasons why one eats at a restaurant: 1- don’t want to cook. 2- don’t know how to cook (and master some special techniques etc…). 3- don’t have access to some special ingredients ( a 90-days aged meat, some exotic herbs for ex). That’s besides wishing to celebrate an event (but you could do that elsewhere).  Most people can’t see the difference between a Bourguignon lobster and a Thermidor beef so the warmth, the attentive staff, the smile on the face of each staff member is what makes the difference between even very high-end restaurants I have visited over the years. A mechanical service is the last thing you want, you know the one where a young staff will mechanically recite a prepared text and where most -young- staff will be too stressed  to make a mistake  and forget to smile?  The other special mention is to be able to interact with owner Jean-Andre Charial. Professionals of his calibre are now sadly rare in this industry, made me think of M. Depee (Pere) as well  from another great Maison a few years ago…Opened on Sunday evening which is great as not much choice elsewhere as we all know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r970123576-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,5,en

Instead of enjoying a peaceful view of alpilles we had to deal with our neighbour feeding his lamb supplement to his dog, listen to crying babies and watching patrons wearing t-shirts and chains vape.  The senior servers are professional, the junior ones with different uniform were amateur for a 3* in France.

The setting itself deserves ten stars if I could give it that. Amazing ambiance with olive trees, gorgeous view of provincial topography , a very serene and calming setting. The food and the gimmicks were a bit disappointing. We did the 10 course tasting menu which was a lot of food. By the end I hated everything that came because I was very full. I would have preferred to have the option of five, seven and ten. The presentation of the food was truly interesting, very creative and very pretty, however I cannot say they  all tasted good. I think more effort was put into presentation versus taste. Again it is one of those three Michelin star restaurant that focuses more on presentation.

Each of the courses was a delight to vision and palate. We had after an appetizer of dots of flavor, two fish courses, one of squid and one of red mullet.

The Terrasse outside when you eat is absolutely gorgeous. 2nd, the service is at the 3 stars Michelin level: perfect from a service point of view but on top of it, top notch on the hospitality part: real professional who knows how to « feel » the mood and style of the customer and adapt to it.

2022-09-05,Ianc87708,"We have been visiting l’oustau since the 90s. Last visit was 2015. I have always felt that they prepared excellent ingredients superbly. The terrace is one of the best dining areas in the world bar none. We were not disappointed with the food, what was disappointing was the change in tone. Whereas previously this had been a place of warmth, welcome and hospitality. In the old days they had a sort of sweet shop/candy store trolley to accompany coffee. Here we were given no choice but a tasting menu of 8 or 10 courses. We saw evidence that choice existed (a gigot bone) but were assured that eating a la carte was not possible. The food we had was exceptional but I would have loved a meal of 3 of the courses. The wine list deserves a mention as one of the best anywhere. The tone has changed - in the past if you asked for something they did their best, nowadays they tell you it isn’t possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r858588977-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,4,en
2022-08-17,Yann D,"Baumanière is a totally enchanting place, arriving there when the sun sets behind the cliff is a joy, being served by the nice and professional crew is a delight. At the end of the dinner, the chefs come and see you, which is always a pleasure.  So what was not up to my expectations? Basically the value for money of the meal. It was all extremely good products, perfectly cooked but so much ""expected"", with so little imagination or fantasy. Lobster, lamb and pigeon are not mandatory if they bore the cook and the client. The sardines with their heads, this was original and unexpected. The desserts are normally a dream of inventiveness, here they are stuck in their tradition. The signature desserts of the house are what, 40 years old?   And tradition can kill a third star. It felt to me nearly the same I felt at Paul Bocuse just before it lost its third star, resting on its laurels, serving the same dishes as under President Giscard d'Estaing... I don't think the crêpe will live forever in my mind as Gilles Goujon's oeuf pourri à la truffe, as Bras's gargouillou de petits légumes, as Eric Fréchon's cannelonni. And this was my disappointment.  However, I'm sure the team has all the capacity to innovate, modernize and be a three-star restaurant worth of 2022. I'll keep an interested eye on the Oustau, wishing you all the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r854636612-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,3,en
2022-05-31,rjbreen,"This was our second stay at the hotel and dinner at the restaurant. Our first was in 2018 when it was a 2-star restaurant and we would have been back sooner had it not been for COVID.  This time was to celebrate our 35th anniversary.   I have often wondered what the difference was between a 2-star and 3-star and now I understand.  While the food was phenomenal both times, the service had clearly risen to a new level. I don’t understand how previous comments were so negative.  I don’t disbelieve them but it is certainly not the experience we had. We ordered the menu Ballade with the upper level of wine pairing so well over $500 euros per person. I can say that the experience was worth every penny.    Dining in such a restaurant is something anyone who is a foodie owes themselves at least once in their lifetime. It is not just the food which was exceptional.  It is the overall experience. The service was like a well oiled machine. The staff was ultra attentive and courteous. The wine pairings were perfect and we had a chance to experience some incredible wines that we otherwise may have never discovered.   If you are looking for a great meal with courteous staff, it is true you can get that in many France restaurants for much less  and we have done a lot of that each year when we spend a month in Provence.  But the experience of dining at l’Ostau de Beaumaniere based on our experience, elevates dining to a level that you may never again experience unless you frequent 3-star Michelin restaurants.

2021-10-26,schmidtmg,"The Oustau de Baumanière is among the iconic restaurants in France and I was glad to see it recover its 3rd star in 2020 - deservedly so in spite of  the incomprehensible number of reviews suggesting otherwise. I had been there in 1977 (!) and recently returned for two consecutive dinners. We chose the Menu ""Ballade des Baux"" for the first evening - of the six courses, a starter of snails and garlic stood out, but the other dishes, except perhaps for the dessert, were excellent too. The second evening, we went à la carte - and the two starters of warm razor clams and roasted anchovies 'in sandwich style' as well as the pigeon and the Honey Millefeuille dessert were top. My wife and sister in law had the milk fed lamb and thought it as the best lamb they had ever eaten. This was served with an adaption of 'gratin dauphinois' which was probably a tad too heavy as a side dish - if there had been some suitable vegetables as a side, that might have been preferable. But this is nitpicking at a high level. The wine list of the Oustau is outstanding - rarely will you find such depth of prestige Burgundies and Bordeaux - what includes Lafleur, Petrus, Domaine de la Romanée Conti. The pricing of these wines is intriguing - some vintages of Romanée Conti wines or Chateau Lafleur are way below their retail price.... which is why we had put two bottles of DRC Vosne Romanée Duvault-Blochet and Echézeaux reserved before our arrival.... and what a treat that was, with memories for a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r816080949-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,5,en

They were never ready, even though there were too many running about.

2021-10-11,Maria J,"The trouble when one expects the best dinner ever, is that just a simple mistake turns the event into a total rip off. And since we experienced several mistakes, the whole night was awful. The waiter did not wear his face mask properly, and kept touching it all the time before setting silverware on the table or serving food. The legs of lamb were cold and full of fat. The potatoes au gratin were cold as well. In other words, we could have spent much less money and enjoy a better dinner elsewhere. Avoid the pretentious attitude.

2021-09-18,Womanatthebesttable,"This was a bad choice that cost well over 1000 Euros; we would suggest you not make the same error. And we will suggest to Michelin that the mere idea of having different bread-items served with various courses is an insufficient reason to have awarded this place an additional star when it is run as poorly as it is--they should not include it on their well-respected list. My husband and I  decided to treat our hosts to the full dinner for our group of friends, believing from our experiences in the past at the same venue three years ago, and then three years before that (when we were guests at the hotel) that we would enjoy festive and memorable dining occasion. Boy, were we WRONG. While I don't speak speak French terribly well, I understand it, and the nasty little comments made about us by the servers--in passing and in undertones--we the kind of snarky remarks you'd expect from 19-year-old diner waiters in Queens--but at least the waiters in Queens would be funny and charming. These servers were simply nasty and judgmental (""This man here,"" said, one, referring to my spouse, ""Knows absolutely nothing about the wine and yet he keeps asking me questions. You talk to him""--a remark, by the way, that had nothing to do with a language barrier). The dishes were indeed inventive and intriguing, if not all equally complex or enjoyable, but the poor service cast an unmistakable shadow over our evening. When we left, I commented on my disappointment to a man I presume was the manager--I was paying the bill and he was overseeing the transaction--and he expressed a small moue of disappointment. He then gave me two little cakes in two little boxes; an odd offering given the number of guests. Let's just say it didn't leave any of us with a better taste in our mouths about the dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r810564886-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,2,en

There are exceptions, workers who have been there for years and try to make up for the shortcomings of the new ones.  For example, the maitre of the restaurant is magnificent, as are the older waiters and especially those who collect your suitcases and make transfers between the reception and the hotel, they are the best of the hotel.  The great loss has been the sommelier's retirement (Gilles Ozzello).His substitute I do not know if he was busy or hiding during our stay but he never attended us and those who did broke all the corks of the bottles ... The hotel has a magnificent wine cellar.  The waiters have a lot to learn from the maitre and what quality standards are in a Michelin star restaurant and in a Relais & Châteax hotel.

Yes, it's expensive, but as is NOT often the case with such multi-starred high-flying restaurants, it is totally worth it. The Ballade des Baux menu is incredible, the sequence of amuse-bouches and dishes is stunning, the seasoning and cooking levels are perfect, course after course after course. The service is spot-on, with the right mix of formalism and pragmaticism. The terrace is sublime. To top it off, there is a proper plateau de Fromages, which is a dying tradition in French restaurants... thanks for keeping this flame alive!  Now, the anecdote: The menu includes snails... I am a sucker for snails, which my grandparents used to ""hunt"" and cook when I was a kid, so I have a special link to them. My daughter and wife a bit less as it is such a polarizing product, even if you've never tried it before. They both requested that this dish got swapped for another course, the waiter came back to us and mentioned that the chef insisted that they try it, although another dish (zucchini flower in Tempura, iirc) would be served to them no matter what. The ladies went ahead, tried it and enjoyed it fully, hurray! The staff forgot the tempura in the meantime but I forgive them, as my wife and daughter have now climbed a major step in the French Gastronomy ladder, thanks to MM. Charial and Viel.

2017-07-22,Liana P,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with my mother and her friend and we were so thrilled with our experience. We had their Greek (left side) 6-course tasting menu with the Greek wine pairings - the meal started with an aperitif of 4 different small delicious treats and then a sundried strawberry and hazelnut amuse-bouche paired with a sparkling rose wine, moved onto a sea urchin dish, a choice of scallops or lobster (I had the lobster, which was served with the best mango/mint/other things I can't remember salad I've ever tasted), a cod dish (my favorite) which they served with their aged sourdough and homemade olive oil (definitely going home with a few bottles, you can't buy them online!!), an amazing lamb sous vide, a selection of Greek cheeses, and ending with a millefeuille and cherry sorbet. The dishes were consistently delicious, the presentation was beautiful, the wine pairings were 100% on point, and our server Zacharias was attentive and informative and made us feel comfortable and at home.  For anyone living in or visiting this area, I cannot sing my praises loudly enough for this restaurant. The ONLY critique I can offer is that the Margi does not promote this restaurant enough. Also, the restaurant is only open during the summer and only on weekdays, but it is still quite new (2 years old I believe) and my hope is that they will gain more well-deserved popularity and attract a broader clientele which may allow them to stay open during peak weekend hours. Their style of dining is not for everyone, but for the price and quality this should be a destination for couples and groups of adults looking for an exciting, sophisticated night out and a meal that is more art than food. I recently ate at L'Espadon at the Ritz in Paris (2 Michelin stars) and La Tour d'Argent (1 Michelin star) and while I am no food critic, the meal I had last night at Patio was a very close rival, if not better in some respects, and CERTAINLY better in terms of the price.  12/10 would dine here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r504375416-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,5,en

2016-07-19,sioulaeleftheria,"The ambiance was great but the food was even better. We decided to visit this restaurant due to the chef's Panagiotis Giakalis.We tried a variety of dishes, each with a unique tatse of Greece. The fish & artichoke is a must, the tasteful blend of the mediteranean cuisine will satisfy every foodies standards.The chicken or egg causality dilemma was definetly an interesting dish to try since it essantially uses anything you can find in a ""chicken coop"".The next dish we tried was  Asope's Fables, the lamp was very juicy and the terinne added an interesting taste contrast. And last but not least, the name of the dessert is the perfect description of what to excpect. Different varietions of peach desserts that will make you crave for more.Finally the service was excellent and i would definitely recommend anyone to visit this restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r394353126-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,5,en
2016-07-17,monsierRatatouille,"Patio is a beautiful restaurant located at a beautifully simple open-air space of The Margi Hotel. The experience we had was unique. We can easily compare it to the one you're left with when leaving 2 or 3 michelin stared restaurants. The menu consists of 2 degustation menus (we chose the one based on Greek flavours) and some a la carte options. The two dishes that stood out: The lobster on homemade pasta filled with smoked aubergine & courgettes & the lamb with a potato & rosemary terrine and pea-sesame oil pure. The only thing that we could say was missing was a bit more light at the table, but that made the ambience very romantic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r393579518-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,5,en
2016-07-15,goldygigi,We visit The Margi hotel with my husband and stay there for three days. Desi ( the guest relation manager) suggest us Patio if we wanted something special. We are very happy that we did it. Scallops and cod fish are plates that we will never forget! Also the desserts peach and masticha are some of the best we have ever try! Restaurant manager Vasilis was amazing too!
