2023-09-10,qscofr1,Really my expectations was high and it was according it. I feel a great place with a great rustic environment but with amazing surprises on the food and amazing set of glasses and dishes.  We have a chance to see how everything was prepared and I can describe how good was everything. This kind of food is not the daily one but it is a composition of flavours combined with textures on a proper way moving to a new way. Probably will come back on important moments on my life because really everything was perfect.   ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r915797481-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2018-11-03,ArthurWang095,"I come here at least once a year. It surprises me every time with great & new gourmet & service. It makes a lot sense & reason why it is Michelin starred for more than 10 years consecutively from the gourmet creativities as well as wine pairing. This time I have too many new dishes plus the signature ones. The sardine in all forms with rosemary smoke, the molecular scallops, the goose liver with cauliflower paste & sauce, truffle with slow cooked pI grin and the signature vinegar cucumber & molecular oyster. The ending ice cream surprised us by its combination of tea sorbet & many flavors. Service is perfect with great explanation. Definitely always an adventure & enjoyment in its gastronomy tour.  很多年了，一年至少來一次。每次來都因為新菜和一流服務而大為驚訝，難怪是超過十年的連年得獎米其林餐廳，因為他創意又紮實的美食、配酒和服務，這次又都是新菜，沙丁魚解構後配上rosemary的煙，分子解構的帶子，鵝肝配上白花椰菜湯及醬，松露佐低溫烹調的鴿子肉，還有他著名的醋黃瓜和蚵仔氮氣粒，甜點的冰淇淋也讓我們驚豔因為加上茶的冰沙和其他味道而超好吃又不甜，服務一流，說菜完美，每次來都變成美食的探索和非常享受。 ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r630484040-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2016-10-18,Matt_Dina,"This place is a little outside Pamplona but if you have a car and like adventurous starred cuisine, it is well worth a visit. We had the menu and got 12 courses. El Molino really cares about the presentation so all dishes are just stunning. The cook knows his stuff: some dishes are classic nouvelle cuisine - probably to show that he can also do boring - but most courses are experimental, molecular cuisine. Some of the experiments were not really my thing (the pinewood smoked foie was too much resiny to supplement the buttery richness of the foie) but many other dishes were revelations. Little frozen green pearls that taste like mussels/oysters to name just one aspect of a marvellous dish where leek (!) plays the leading role. The drinks are not included. Their bread is great. They say they make it themselves but I have a feeling they get it from this wonderful bakery in Gorraiz...

2016-04-19,martinezcm,"There are three Michelin starred restaurants in Pamplona. This one just a couple of miles North (a short cab drive) maybe the best. It is in the countryside with easy free parking in an old refitted stone building by the roadside. Do not let the simple stone building  fool you. Inside is one of the best restaurants in the whole central Pyrennees. They have a fix price menu with perhaps too many servings but also have a short carte with outstanding offering of classical regional dishes refined without bizarre touches of molecular cuisine. Their smoke foie is the best example.You cannot miss with either the fish or meat choices. The wine selection is very good and the prices reasonable, for this type of restaurant. Only the prices of the dessert choices were out of proportion to their content. Otherwise the modernized rustic interior and the efficient service make the experience a most pleasant scape from the noise and cramped quarters of the other good choices withing Pamplona city limits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r365337005-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks
2015-07-08,Jason M,"I came to Pamplona during the festival of San Fermin, but running the bulls, although a MUST experience, was not the highlight of our trip.  The Mill at Urdaniz claims that honor.  Chef David Yarnoz is BRILLIANT!  We were greeted at the door by Javier and Isabella, and the welcome could not have been warmer.  We were given a choice of seating and selected the more formal dining area upstairs.  The menu was in Spanish, and we as American tourists were lacking in that area, so the Chef sent a young sous chef to our table to translate.  As a party of six, all but one selected the tasting menu priced at 70 Euros.  The courses that followed were the highlight of our trip.  Isabella, the matron of the establishment (and I surmise the mother of the talented Chef David Yarnoz) was gracious to a degree that I have never experienced as a patron.  There was a language barrier for us and she and the wait staff assisted in a way that one would have expected at a place like Charlie Trotter's if you were Spanish and spoke no English.  Every detail was covered and we all felt like the whole team pulled together to ensure our experience was exquisite, and it was.  All of the courses were regionally designed to make it a true local gastronomic experience, and if I ever return to Pamplona this will be the first thing I book.  The charming old mill is located approx. 20 minutes outside of town, and it provided us with a wonderful opportunity to take a step back from the hectic atmosphere of San Fermin and spend a quiet evening among friends, one that will never be forgotten.  Great wine, Excellent food, and an atmosphere conducive to a long social meal with friends.  Thank you Chef David, Isabella, and Javier for adding so much value to our Pamplona experience of a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r286983146-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

We reserved for lunch on Easter Sunday. It was a dreary day when we left Pamplona and headed up into the hills, you follow the National road which heads toward the French border. The restaurant is located on the bend before you enter the village of Urdaniz. A quaint stone build, which must have been the Windmill in a former life. Inside, downstairs there is a local restaurant, which was doing a brisk trade.  The more formal area is upstairs, with its exposed beams, neutral tones, it is a pleasant environment for what was an excellent lunch. From the gin & tonic starter, which melted on the tongue to the wonderfully chocolate laden dessert, there were some courses which could be described as ""samey"", on the whole the meal was excellent, the service charming, unobtrusive & knowledgeable.

The explanation is brief, but complete, they do not give you an existential talk of the motivations of the cook when it comes to inspiration, it is simply haute cuisine, technique purified by years of work and an obvious commitment, for good doing. Delight in each of the 14 passes, in a very well-kept environment, with Top-rated ingredients in the area.  The dishes are the protagonists, arrive at the table well timed, served professionally, direct from the kitchen you have in sight.

Not in vain, it is the only restaurant in the world with two Michelin stars (that I know of) that does not offer different appetizer passes, live dishes or in the kitchen and all the paraphernalia of this type of restaurant.

2024-07-20,Smudger,"On arrival  they told us not to look at the menu they gave us which was waxed closed as it is a surprise experience. Sadly, it wasn’t the experience we were expecting as 13 of the 15 courses were vegetarian which we did not expect. Don’t mind some vegetarian courses but not 90 %. The paired wines included 8 wines of which 6 were unfiltered which again one or two unfiltered would be fine hence not what we were expecting. Portion sizes were off the scale poor and even the flavour and quality of produce was way below expectation mostly bland. Having eaten in many Michelins  based restaurants .. 360 and Proto in Dubrovnik, Sukaldean and Bernard Extea in San Sebastien to name a few where quality of food and overall experience was truly Michelin. This experience was sadly our worst experience of a Michelin based restaurant hence fell way below expectation as food is a key element of any dining experience which was unbelievably poor in this case. Given we were in Hungary we expected some form of Goulash would have been on the menu given claims of local produce!! The only plus was the service. Finally, the price was staggeringly  out of sync with the food quality and wines hence as much as I hate to say it, it was a complete ripoff as one of the courses was bread n butter to fill us up as the previous and future courses would have left us still hungry.

2024-03-31,Koltrip,"Not sure what to rate this fine dining restaurant. From you enter you are taking very good care of. Everything works very good. During the 15 courses which I think is a bit exaggerated because some of the ""dishes"" are so small that you almost can't taste them, we had 2-3 highlights. The bread for 1 of the dishes was maybe the best bread ever eaten. The mushroom dish was also very good. Rest of the dishes was average and a couple was not tasty. When it comes to the wine paring, we had local wines, there were many highlights. We had one small dish we couldn't eat and to be honest at this level of dining we expected that they would come up with some extra for us but they didnt. Overall a good experience but many of the dishes are too small. Myself I just get irritated to get dishes that are at this size. So maybe based on the price and expectations of this kind of restaurant it should get a 3/5 but the wine paring gives it a 4/5. 210.000 forint are expensive for a couple.

2023-11-12,Zesty1,"Exquisite and indulgent - but the multiple courses were all very clean, with a focus on local ingredients, and they had a vegetarian option for my wife which made this place stand out.   First off we did find it slightly uncomfortable (it's not a discreet dining experience, but rather interactive, with tables near each other and facing to the open room, and other couples within earshot). The  requisite presentation was a little florid, and they make a lot of spectacle about the chef's personal stories etc - but they did a good job with it overall. Waiters didn't always look comfortable standing around either but they were speedy and the service was good.  Eventually we did get into the swing of things and relaxed a bit during the meal (helped by excellent local natural wines and lemonades).  Not cheap but also not on the crazy side of the price spectrum of Michelin restaurants. It appeared that this was the most sustainable of them all in Budapest, which I also appreciated. Recommended.

2023-06-22,Michael U,"Opened in 2019 SALT is considered by many to be Budapest's best Restaurant, its location in a boutique hotel called RUM featuring warm wood tones surrounding an open kitchen with most plates finished at a pass in front.  Led by Chef Szilárd Tóth and Manager Máté Boldizsár with service comparable to the world’s best, many dishes telling a tale of Hungarian heritage, SALT relies on ideas akin to “new Nordic” fare with foraging and fermentation at the forefront while Beverages look to local or natural Wines plus Juices made to pair.

Plated Scandinavian but distinctly Hungarian in terms of terroir, one-bite “Greasy bread” hearty but balanced with Eel instead of Jowl Bacon, Cauliflower comes charred next to Walnut Cream that leads well into Cheese topped with micro-planed Pork Heart.  Contemporary with roots in local ingredients and rural dishes, the casual environment adding to the sense of dining at a friend’s house, Tóth’s “Chicken of the Woods Mushroom” comes in aromatic Corn Miso prior to a refreshing “Gin & Tonic” Bite composed in the kitchen.  Choosing another Juice going forward, Lime and Strawberry accented by Bay Leaf holding up to Soup and Bread made for dipping, a second plate in the same vein references a peasant dish from Pécs rethought with Foie Gras and Duck Heart in hearty Broth.  Pumping the breaks with raw local Trout in an ice bowl, acidic like Aguachiles but lacking Chiles, Potatoes in Duck Fat proves to be an elegant setup for sticky Pork Ribs intended to be eaten as a Lettuce Wrap topped in fermented foraged Greens.   Outpacing the single Michelin Star received in 2021, a Cheese course adjacent Chestnut Honey and Pine transitioning to sweet, SALT’s Rice Pudding with Chamomile is an exercise in restraint that fully engages the palate before finishing with floral Matcha and a quartet of Petit Four.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r896865619-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

Make sure you get a table that allows full view of the kitchen.

2023-05-07,geterd0ne,"Deserving of all the attention and praise from it's star. All the courses were beautifully presented with attention to detail and the service was perfectly choreographed. With prior warning during our reservation, they delivered a extravagant vegetarian course for one person in our party.   The menu changes seasonally and has a lot of fermented flavors, and less obsessive about heavy fats as compared to other fine dining. It's a long tasting menu and paced to fill you up. We opted away from the wine pairing and they offered a delightful pairing of homemade juices. Some of the juices were highly unorthodox, but each was immaculately paired to the uniqueness of the course in front of you.   My only negative opinions would be the chef is leaning-in on the sustainability angle a little too hard in the protein department. Also for a 3.5-4 hour seating, the chairs they are using for their 2-person tables is woefully inadequate in the comfort department. The service, glassware, and presentation were all multi-star experience, but the soft touches seemed to be lacking.   All considered they delivered exactly on what they promised and we'll be back.

2023-04-21,Zesty1,"I came to Salt with my girlfriend just to try it out, and we were blown away. We don't always enjoy stuffy, regimented fine dining experiences, but our initial apprehension (we had just seen the movie the Menu, and were reminded of this) was immediately suppressed by the quiet courtesy and professionalism of the staff, and a stunning sequence of dishes that catered to both of us (my girlfriend is a vegetarian, and the vegetarian versions of the menu delivered completely too).  For this, I specifically wanted something that focused on sustainable food, farm to table, or a cuisine that didn't make me feel like I was eating somewhere that was importing lobster from Maine into a landlocked country over thousands of miles. This reminds more of the style of modern Scandinavian cuisine, with very pure and earthy flavors, local produce and meat, and the chefs and various servers presented a story with each course that reflected the desire for homegrown fare, and also completely delivered.   I can't really describe a standout dish - I can only say that dish after dish was completely delicious, and oftentimes hitting the peak of flavor combinations that made our brains go mushy with euphoria.   It's the best restaurant I have tried in Budapest. It is certainly an expense (roughly 400-500 euro for 2 people), but if you are into a full, hours-long food experience it, it is worth the money and the time.   My one criticism was the layout of the place - as I diner II felt somewhat exposed and at first uncomfortable, rather than tucked into a romantic or private space with a partner, even with the view of the kitchen, which was very nice.

2022-09-20,#rooftopfoodie,"Salt is a fairly new Budapest establishment and a worthy Michelin-star holder. It is small with only ten tables so booking well in advance is the only chance to enjoy a meal here. The fixed menu relies on Hungarian traditions and many special local ingredients, many coming from the village where the chef grew up. It also includes many unusual ingredients for Hungarian kitchen such as snails once favored by wealthy noble families and now extinct from tables. For foreigners probably best to visit with a Hungarian who undoubtedly will relate many childhood stories to some of the food served. The wines in the wine pairing are mostly biodynamic and natural so unless favoring such flavours, probably better to choose from the wine menu. A truly memorable experience that is best begun or ended in the rooftop bar of the hotel where the restaurant also is located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r861030238-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

Good and very friendly waiter and a pleasant serving speed. The restaurant definitely deserves its stella (star).

The Michelin guide's description is perfect:  “The dishes, beautiful for the eyes and exquisite for the palate, are complex and elaborate, but never unnecessarily artificial.” I noted only one flaw, which was also annoying: the sommelier waiter. Unlike foods, it is ""unnecessarily artificial."" He expresses himself with a tone of voice that is not suited to the freshness of the place and the food, with a vocabulary that is completely out of place (""let's start playing with this wine...""). Added to this, unfortunately, is the quantity of drink needed for each glass, well below the 10cc which would be the minimum dose required by law. The timeliness of the service compared to the courses also left something to be desired.

We took one first and on 2nd course, each. Quality seems good, and presentation is nice. A good selection of complementary appetizers from the chef was served, too.  I honestly will go for typical (old times cheap) meat, so ""animelle"" (Sweetbreads toast) and ""lingua"" (Milanese style calf tongue).

2023-07-22,Playapepper,"We were very hopeful upon seeing the dining room and roof deck and the space was light, open, sensual and inviting. Next, the show stopper was the amuse-bouche, which offered a delightful and exotic trip for the palette.  Unfortunately, this inspiring beginning was the best part of the night for us.   The head waiter was unwelcoming and hurried and no other person in the restaurant engaged with our table. For a place that rests it's entire philosophy on time and slowness, our dinner could not have been more of the antithesis.   After traveling throughout Italy and Switzerland and visiting some of the best restaurants, each experience we had prior to Horto was some of the most stunning displays of hospitality and culinary excellence.  In our other restaurants experiences throughout Europe both sommeliers and servers took their time and demonstrated pride in offering us creative narrative, ingredient explanations, and notes and history of the wine. We experienced none of this care, enthusiasm, or passion at Horto. For a very expensive check we paid for the bare minimum without any of the hospitality one expects from a Michelin rated restaurant.    Additionally, a storm came during our dinner and while I understand that this is a change of course for the restaurant, it was as if it was their first time encountering this event. One would hope that the weather is a well-ironed aspect of how the establishment plans their operation given the roof. We ended up waiting sometimes 30 minutes between courses and our evening ended up starting at an 8pm seating, and ending at 12 midnight. We found several of the courses to be bland, unseasoned, and in some cases inedible.   It was a disappointment to end our trip this way. If you are looking for a fantastic culinary experience in Milan, visit Felix Lo Basso's restaurant. You will not be disappointed.

The food was quite tasty, but not exceptional and in our opinion not qualitatively comparable to other star restaurants we have been to, but the service was downright mediocre. Therefore the low review. There were two of us. Allergy from one person passed on in advance, but was not asked which of the two. Meat cleaver gehannes put with fish dish and vague wine advice. After forty-five minutes when most of the other tables had started earlier, the music went out and there were hardly any staff. Refilling water was not done and whether we still wanted wine was not asked. Dessert was served without drink advice while all glasses were empty. Therefore I asked for a sparkling wine myself that we had also received at the start, but we were recommended another wine that was put on the bill for € 35 per glass without further explanation. At the end, we felt a little robbed. A lunch for two people for € 385 with a very mediocre service.

Good but not ""magical"" dishes, the risotto is what I appreciated the most. Negative note, the noise: the location is fantastic, it overlooks the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele but the noise echoes in the restaurant and it feels like being in a pizzeria (without taking anything away).

2024-08-05,Ali R,"The food was amazing - you will not be disappointed with the fantastic flavors that you never thought possible with vegetarian food.  However, for a 3* restaurant, the ambiance and experience leave much to be desired.  We were seated in a small, cramped basement.  For me or my wife to rise from the table, the waitstaff had to come and move the table so we could get up.  There were plenty of times when our water or wine glasses ran dry, the crumbs were not cleaned from our tablecloth, my wife's napkin wasn't folded when she left the table, and several other minor things that would not matter at all were we not used to better experiences at other 3* places.

2024-05-23,Helmut,"NOTE: the rating given is relative to other 3 Michelin star restaurants I have eaten at worldwide.   Alain Passard is a genius when it comes to flavors. To me, this was the 3-star surprise of the evening: At times underwhelming looking dishes that, when tried, were an explosion on the palate. Using freshly-farmed in-season vegetables are key to the flavors. The chef merely combines them in the most perfect way. Still, I expected more out of the ordinary for a 3-star restaurant and, to be honest, some dishes – based on looks and technique – would easily be served at any average restaurant. Take for example the salad. Completely unassuming until you try the dressing. A shout out goes to the bread, because it was truly amazing. As such, I am a little torn here with my rating and will knock off one point.   The place is tiny but with a cute decor. However, the compact place also means a lot of traffic from the service staff. As there is no loop through the dining area, there is no way for the staff to move graciously between the tables. This means often staff leaving some guests unattended. My biggest complaint was in regard to the front of house timing. Someone would bring out a plate from the kitchen. It would be placed on a cart for inspection. It often would sit there alone, unattended, until the right server would spot it, pick it up and deliver it. Pretty poor communication if you ask me. Even worse, more than once was I sitting dry with food on the plate and no wine in the glass. The wine and food timing was completely off.   Other small mistakes, such as not adjusting my napkin after I excused myself for the wash room, a slice of bread that was put on my plate and then taken back to the tray after I declined on more bread, and the fact that my coat could not be found are mistakes that should never happen in a 3-star place. It is clear to me that the chef lives in his kitchen, but front of house are running around without clear marching orders or supervision. For this I am knocking off another point.   If you love food and amazing flavors and can look beyond some of the front of house faux pas, then by all means do not skip L'Arpege. But if you are a stickler expecting crazy dishes that wow you visually it is best you stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r951997329-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,3,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2024-04-28,vincybie,"  Recently, my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to dine at the renowned three Michelin star restaurant, Arpège in Paris. As vegetarian on that day, we were excited to explore the vegetarian-friendly options this establishment had to offer. However, our experience fell short of our expectations due to various factors that left us feeling dissatisfied and overcharged.  Unwelcoming Start:  Upon our arrival, we found the restaurant door closed, After peering inside, we noticed someone standing there, seemingly aware of our presence. To our surprise, the lady asked us to return 30 minutes later as the restaurant was ""not ready"" , leaving us feeling unwelcome.   The Price Shock:  While waiting, we decided to pass the time at a nearby café. Curiosity led us to browse the restaurant's website, where we discovered the exorbitant prices associated with each dish, particularly the set menu. The steep cost gave us pause and ultimately led us to contemplate canceling our reservation. Unfortunately, we discovered that the cancellation fee was a staggering 1000 Euros, leaving us feeling trapped.  Underwhelming Main Course:  Once seated and served, we found that the complimentary appetizers were the highlight of our meal. However, I was disappointed by the limited options for vegetarian main courses. The sole vegetarian dish I chose resembled the complimentary raw vegetable platter we had, albeit cooked and caramelized. Regrettably, it tasted more like a warm dessert rather than a satisfying savory main course. It was disheartening to leave my main dish unfinished, especially considering the hefty price tag of 155 Euros for a plate consisting of only ten small pieces of steamed vegetables. This is not the first time I had vegetarian dishes at 1 to 3 Michelin Star world wide.   Lackluster Dessert Experience:  Despite expressing our fullness to the server, we were persuaded to order two kinds of desserts to share. We requested half-sized portions, but even then, we were unable to finish a single dessert. The unappetizing experience with the desserts further contributed to our overall dissatisfaction. In an attempt to minimize waste, we decided to take the complimentary desserts with us and later gifted them to a homeless woman with a beautiful dog the following day.  Unpleasant Surprise:  As we were preparing to leave, to our astonishment, our table server opened a new bottle of water without seeking our consent. The additional charge for the unrequested water was an unwelcome surprise, further adding to our growing disappointment.  Conclusion:  Our experience at Arpège, though highly anticipated, turned out to be a letdown.

2024-02-07,daniel snyder,"I had a delightful and amazing time today at Arpege.  I had left the Rodin Museum today, my first day out in Paris after recovering from flu.  I was searching for a restaurant and entered Arlene, asking if they had a table for myself.  the greeter was smiling, friendly, and welcoming!  I was seated with Simon, the waiter, and he and the kitchen went above and beyond....the food was PURE ART and the taste of the many dishes was PURE HEAVEN!!!!  I knew I was in a rarefied culinary world when ordering herbal tea, they wheeled in pots full of gorgeous herbs for me to select.  my main plate was scallops encased in bay leaves with a lobster sauce.

2024-01-30,Barbara J,"My husband and I dined at Arpege on 26th Jan to celebrate my 50th birthday. Unfortunately, the diner is memorable for its utter mediocrity.  I was reluctant to try L'Arpege given its mixed reviews and should have followed my instinct. We dined at the one star Qui Plume la Lune the previous night and it was superb. I don't normally write reviews but would like to prevent others – especially vegetarians –  from bothering with this tired lazy restaurant. I have been a vegetarian for 38 years and dined in many 3 star, 2 star and 1 star restaurants throughout the world so feel qualified to judge L'Arpege. The service was unfocused and casual to the point of sloppy (wine glasses were uncleared, service was not attentive etc.) The menu was what one might expect from a farm restaurant in that the produce was good quality but sloppy in presentation and not remotely creative in combination of flavours.The vegetarian selection of dishes (there is no vegetarian set menu option any more) did not cohere  together. The chef seems to expect diners to be impressed by his egg starter that he's been serving for nearly 30 years. Haute vegetarian dining has moved on. Diners should too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r936120759-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,1,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks
2024-01-18,Fab',"Extremely creative cuisine. As expected for a proper 3-stars, you get transported in a unique world, in the chef's vision. For many things, you can't tell if it's good or if it's bad, simply because this is something you've never experienced nor tasted before. You just drop a tear and you ask for more.  The servings are very generous and even for a large eater like me, finishing the meal was becoming a challenge.  The service is extremely classy and professional, as well as the attire of the servers. As expected, the wine list is telescopic and only the help of the sommelier can properly guide you through the best pairing.  We will point the attention brought to single travelers who are greeted with a comic book explaining the chef's vision, work and the dishes. That makes time fly.  The imitation of the classic ""sauce beurre blanc"" (white butter sauce) is extraordinary. I only experienced such experiment in another 3-stars.  Overall, all aspects of the French cuisine are here and mastered: vegetables, plants, meat, fish, traditional, modern, creative, etc… and all is well executed. No molecular cuisine or nitrogen artefacts here. In fact, what surprises the most is that the dishes seem so simple and the list of ingredients seem so short that you feel you could do it yourself; only until you taste what is presented to you. Another thing that surprises is that ingredients that seem not to go together are married, and the result is out of this world.   The lower room I was in is decorated with real flowers put on a wall looking like a painting canvass. Never seen before and you can spend long minutes looking at it in details.  You clearly are in the world of an artist who's very dedicated. For example, one of the components of one of the starters is turnip. The chef has experimented the same turnip seed, planted at the same time in 3 of his gardens disseminated across this part of France, and then found out that the end-result will give 3 different products. Based on that he will choose what seems to be the best for him.  The old-time hot-cold egg is a wonder of creativity and craftsmanship by the mastery of required technicality for the cooking, and perfect timing for the serving; indeed, if you wait too long for eating it, the surprising hot-cold effect is no longer there.  If there is one small negative thing to mention: be warned that you have to park yourself. No valet, no dedicated parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r934576453-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks
2023-11-11,Mehdi M,"I would recommend the restaurant for its food. I came to the Arpege to taste the vegetables of Alain Passard, and I am not disappointed.    - The plate of amuse-bouche made of slide root vegetables and little shells was simple but well presented. The taste was on point. - The classic Arpege egg was delicious as expected. - Another classic: the vegetable dumplings were superb. The broth was especially excellent with notes of celery. - the ""sushi"" with kalamata olives was well balanced and well executed. I appreciate that the chef took into consideration my dislike for cheese and provided this dish instead. - the squash soup with the sage whipped cream was excellent. The texture was silky smooth and buttery. I would have liked nice quenelle of cream rather than a rustic looking scoop. - the leek and pear with a very interesting dish. The associate worked perfectly. The note of pepper on top were what needed to elevate this dish. The leeks provided some welcome mache. - The quenelle of scallop and truffle was a surprise since I was expecting only vegetable. It was delicious nonetheless. The parsnip? and truffle cream was again silky smooth and the crunch of the fresh truffles balanced this very well. - The beet tartare, another classic was on point and the mustard carrot condiment worked so well with it. A great dish. - the final savory dish was my least favorite of all. While I was impressed by the cooking of each winter vegetable, the sweet and sour sauce was not to my liking. The buttery taste was too overpowering for me. - the hazelnut souffle was great. A great balanced of nutty and smooth chocolate flavors. - another classic, sweet this time. the flower apple tarte. Great touch of tartness here and there and nice puff pastry. The caramel was unexpectedly sour.  - the plate of migniardises was well assorted. The vanilla whisky macarons will be remembered.  The small size of the room and the large and necessary numbers of staff make the dining room feel cramped and crowded at all time. The constant back and forth of the staff (again necessary) made us difficult for us to stay focused on the food and conversation. Would we have been seated at the different table (other than the little square table behind the entrance) it might have been different. This will be difficult to improve because it is due to the size of the dining room.  The staff was professional and understanding at all time. However, service is the area that could use some improvements. - I made a 12pm reservation but the door was closed at noon and opened 4-5 min later. - The waitress who greeted us at our table had a stained on her jacket lapel. That should not happen at the beginning of a service. - We chose the vegetable lunch menu. We explained that we were not ""heavy"" drinkers and that we would go with wine by the glass. Since we did not know what we will be eating, we asked for recommendations and the answer we got was that people usually go with white. We were a bit surprised back the lack of depth of the answer. - The choice given for aperitif was not large. Since we declined champagne (because we do not like bubbly wine and I will come back to that) we were provided with only one option: a glass of chardonnay. We decided to give it a little bit of thought. Once my spouse returned from the restrooms, the waitress asked us if we were ready for our glass of wine. It felt that we did not have other choice than to accept it. That was a bit pushy - We appreciate that one of our waiters asked about the pace of the meal we would like to adopt. We gladly enjoy the little wait between dishes. The overall experience lasted for four hours and did not feel like it. It was well paced. - My wife being American, the staff talked to us in English. Hearing the descriptions of the dishes and other interactions with customers, I found out that we missed on numerous details. Should we come back, we will ask for the French version and I will translate for my wife. - Coming back to the champagne, when the bill was given to us, I noticed that a glass of champagne was mistakenly charged instead of an aperitif wine. While we appreciate the commercial gesture of offering us the water, we should be able to trust such establishment to get the bill right without having to check it. However, I am glad I did.  The menu was reasonably priced with outstanding produce and impeccable attention to detail. The extra like coffee and water were quite expensive. The pours of wine or digestives could be a bit more generous. I went to similar establishments outside Paris, where generosity was of primary importance. Unfortunately, it seems that it is a trait of province and not Paris.

2023-08-24,Loulwa_Kaloyeros (Assaker),"I was treated to an amazing experience on my 60th birthday. This was a memorable lunch from start to finish. We opted for the surprise lunch menu of 11 dishes and added a main - we had the Dover sole and the sweetbreads. We spent over 3 hours being entertained with one dish after the other of utter delight and deliciousness. All the plates were full of flavor, pieces of art and an ode to vegetables. We also had several iconic dishes such as the egg which has been on the menu for 37 years! How can an egg be so tasty?? We also had the beetroot tatare with its condiments. And since tomatoes and lovage are in season, the gaspacho, minestrone (with eel) and the sushi exposed the elegance of this fruit. The highlight of the dessert was the chocolate millefeuille. In 60 years I have never seen this baked to perfection. It was sublime. A gastronomic delight. Everything was served with a lot of elegance - the staff balanced professionalism with a sweet human touch. The sommelier was such an expert (lots of natural wines) who catered to our desires. The finale was a beautiful plate of sweets and tarts that we asked to take home. The whole experience was remarkable. And yes maybe the restaurant is small but it felt very intimate. The sounds from the kitchen audible as the doors opened but this also made the experience genuine. Yes it is expensive but for a 3 star Parisian restaurant of this calibre a lunch menu for 185 € is really a great deal (eleven dishes!). Thank you Alain Passard for giving vegetables a royal treatment and for tantalizing our palates with amazing French produce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r912656878-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2023-07-04,nick164,"Arriving on a drizzly Parisian winter's evening 5 minutes before my reservation time, I found the door locked. A staff member looked blanky through the window before finally opening the door. Having advised them I had a reservation they then indicated they were not yet open and left me on the street until 731pm. An appalling initial impression, noting this is not a hotel restaurant with a pleasant foyer to wait.   If I knew what was to come, I would have just left.   The decor is pleasant. The dining room felt quite crowded, with the table being located next to the busy kitchen and its squeaky door. Dietary and allergy requirements provided at the time of booking were forgotten. Whilst the majority of dinners were English speaking, the menu is still not available in English. And most disappointingly for this once renowned vegetarian restaurant is that the menu no longer even has a vegetarian selection.  Having opted for the 5-course, the waiter initially continued a 'hard sell' for the 12-course before just proceeding to outline his favourite dishes that could be adapted as vegetarian. On enquiring on a degustation, the Sommelier just thrust a menu and advised they don't offer one. I requested 3 wines by the glass to match the 5 courses.  The recommended wines were ok, but the supposed Sommelier's abilities were poor. Having recommended a wine, it arrived with the very limited introduction of ""this is a Sauvignon Blanc"" before just walking off - there was a little improvement over time but not much.  In terms of the food: - No butter or olive oil was provided with the bread. - The amuse bouche was nice, but being advised to stir it would have made the difference. - The first course of dumplings was very tasty. - The second course of onion gratin with truffle smelled good but was effectively a plate of onion with shaved truffle and greenery atop. - The third course of beet tartar was very nice. - The fourth course of leek and truffle was, similar to the onion, a plate of leek just hidden under some truffle. - The fifth course was a plate of favourless vegetables in a sauce.   The 'cheese board' was a block of Comte. Bizarrely for a tasting course, all courses were savoury - with dessert then being an additional cost. Dessert options then proposed included those I was allergic too.  Service was poor. There are lots of staff, yet most plates went uncleared for some time. I failed to finish multiple dishes yet only on the last did the waiter enquire. Upon asking for the bill, the waiter advised the fifth course would be deducted.  Most definitely not recommended. I visit Paris a couple of times a year and I will not be back to Arpege.

2023-06-20,RYOKO,"I went there for lunch (set menu) and found this famous clearly overrated. The place has two levels. Downstairs is litterally the basement with no window so very claustrophobic. We were initially downstairs but we asked for a table upstairs and fortunately we managed to get one. Already better but the place is so small that we ended up being not far to the kitchen door, which is obviously disruptive. In terms of service, except for the somelier, everybody was extraordinarily snooty. The female maitre d' is was a caricature of what American tourists dread in Paris. The food is certainly sophisticated, almost excessively, with too much emphasis on style and not enough on substance. In summary, a disappointing, if not painful, experience, obviously made worse by the overpiced bill. Avoid.

2024-01-19,Coastal34348810760,"Despite playfully poking fun at the traditional Dutch eating habits, my dining experience over the past year has been nothing short of extraordinary. When my husband mentioned that De Nieuwe Winkel in Nijmegen was crowned the Best Vegetable Restaurant in the World two years in a row by We're Smart, I knew that I had to experience it for myself. We took a spontaneous detour, canceling our reservation at L'Arpège in Paris for our anniversary dinner to savor the flavors of Chef Emile van der Staak's Botanical Gastronomy. Tucked away in the former Catholic orphanage of Nijmegen, finding this hidden gem added an extra layer of adventure to our evening. Chef Emile's dedication to showcasing the best of Dutch ingredients amazed us. Nearly everything sourced locally, from Food Forest Ketelbroek to Ommuurde Tuin, Bodemzicht, and even green tea from Brabant. It's a true celebration of eating local taken to the next level. In Chef Emile's words, ""Once nature has done its work, it is our turn. We pick. Smell. Taste. Analyze. Ferment. Cook. Until there is something on your plate that amazes and overwhelms you."" Our enthusiasm for tasting the custom-made botanical drink pairings led to an exclusive tour of their lab. Witnessing the craftsmanship behind the scenes, from cheese to tempe, nukazuke, and all the botanical drinks, was an eye-opening experience. De Nieuwe Winkel is not just a restaurant; it's a culinary sanctuary where nature's bounty is transformed into art on your plate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r934701823-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks
2023-10-07,DutchAlfred,"Let's start with the positive: the food is innovative and brings you a complete new range of flavours. And the service in general is on spot, yet informal.  Now the flipside: I did not like certain dishes, which can happen. But no one asks how the dish was when they clear it, and when I told them that I did not like a dish, the only question was 'Shall I then clear it?' I would have expected that if you don't like two or three dishes (and they are all a surprise for you) that you offer an alternative. Or at least a free coffee at the end. But nothing. When I raised this to the chef/owner, he told me that this did not fit in his cooking process and that he actually was not interested in his clients' feedback on the dishes. Which I find really odd for a 2-Michelin star restaurant with these prices. I told him I felt dissatisfied with my restaurant visit and he let me go.

2023-01-08,maaikepypekamp,"We went to De Nieuwe Winkel in December with a party of 4. We opted for the 9-course menu and added an extra ""cheese platter"" dish. All of the dishes, even for well-seasoned vegans, were surprising in that many were unrecognisable with unique appearances and tastes. The sunflower butter and accompanying crackers, for example, were delicious. The use of unusual ingredients such as a local lemongrass and Kliswortel is admirable.  However, several dishes were also disappointing: the coiled cabbage (with silky tofu) and the (undercooked?) leek (in the superb Spirulina algae broth) were stringy and tough to break down; the ""chocolate"" desert was very oily; and the vegan cheese dish wrapped in vine leaves was rather distasteful; and the “risotto” was too rich. The wine pairing was OK (the smoked white wine is perhaps an acquired taste) and the non-alcohol version is to be recommended with unusual tastes. The service is very extravagant with waiters calling out dishes in unison and a bit over the top obsequiousness.

But then you will enjoy super fine, clean, bio, wild, creatively prepared, steamed, roasted, fermented, extracted, squeezed, mandolinized, and what have you, dishes you never tasted before. Wines and beers: same.  But as there is no price list for the drinks, no written indication of what there is (and be sure: a great abundancy there is) you could be tempted to ask for a price indication. Do. It is OK, not exaggerated. With the menu there comes a standard water service, bubble and still, for 7 € unlimited refill per 2 menus, at least that I extracted from the bill.

We chose the 6-course surprise menu with wine pairing. We got 6 tiny courses, with barely anything to eat in each of them, from a tiny piece of pumpkin to a tiny piece of leek. Luckily the bread was nice otherwise I would have had to have an actual dinner when coming back home. Out of the 6 wines, 2 were some kind of beers that have nothing to do in this pairing. Tasteless, very sour and extremely disappointing. The dessert was the cherry on the cake, although I wish there had been actual cake and cherry. Hay ice cream sandwich between two hay cookies. Maybe it's very original and unique but come on. So, we paid 240 euros for 2 for a disappointing very light dinner. But hey, it's hype to be vegetarian, right? So why would they not enjoy charging customers so much to serve them the most basic ingredients (remember, hay!).

2018-04-14,Robert K,"We went this evening to restaurant De Nieuwe Winkel, because it has a great recommendation on tripadvisor. It is a small cousy restaurant with trendy staff. We could choose between meet (chicken), fish or vegetarian menu.  Because we had some appetite we choose the 6 courses menu with fish. You get something different comparing to other fancy places. We choose fish, so you expect some fish. One of the starters had a bit of fish in it and that was it. The main course was a tasty piece of a carrot (but then purple) and the second main course some beet. Loved the dessert most. A tasty appel and a nice vegie cheesecake variation. We had a nice evening, but at the end we had to laugh about it.  If we would go here with our parents they would call us crazy. 160 euro for a petit carrot and beet as main-course. Ridiculous.  So if you are a vegetarian and you want something tasty this is the place, but you pay a lot for it. If you want a nice piece of fish or meat better go to another place.

2016-10-27,Filip V,"I was marveled up to my expectations - and even beyond - by an evening dinner visit to this intriguing taste - foundry . The setting is minimalistic , rather sober and casual , a little sub ..  . The service is prompt , the staff  warm , friendly and ready to explain or providing a helping comment where decrypting the dishes sometimes is necessary . And they evidently enjoy this in a slightly teasing , but overall professional way . The level of team spirit is to be admired .    Behind the name  ""A new store""  a deliciously wonderful and creative approach is  used by the young chef and his equipe , to transform classic grocery ingredients to a fantastic delicatessen level .  Respect for biological protective principles and fresh quality  is outstanding .  It confirms the hand of a promising master , passionately weaving new techniques and associations around  old standards with surprising flavours and freshness .  At the end not the cheapest of bills ( 92 € - 5 courses & associated wines/juices/beer ), but this type of commitment and work deserves a merit .

2018-04-03,E M,"Lluernas is a dining experience. A very special one. The service was perfect and the food was just as good.   We opted for the tasting menu (and added a cheese course as well). Each course was delicious and more interesting than the next, with a personal favourite of mine being a take on beef wellington with celeriac (see photos). There was also a very detailed description of each course.  The restaurant is located in santa Coloma, and you wouldn’t necessarily know it’s there (or so good) unless you knew. It’s worth taking the metro to have a try. The bill came to around 200 EUR including wine, really reasonable for what it was.   The atmosphere is calm and relaxed, not in any way stuffy as I expected it to be to be honest. We felt welcome and didn’t feel we were being forced out the door (even if we were the last to leave). Overall, we spent a very special 3 hours in lluernas and I look forward to doing it again soon!  There’s also a tapas bar next door (same owners) which I’ll be paying a visit to very soon!

Please do not get me wrong: we loved the family style. The way it was presented to us: not so much. As I said: I've been a dozen or more times, never with a party of six though.  The six of us loved our entrées pizza and pasta (and when I say we loved we really really loved them) - however, our starters were rather meh - the BURRATA E PESCHE was not creamy at all and the POLIPO ALLA BRACE was more of a black bean salad with two small pieces of ""grilled octopus"" that was underwhelmingly ""un-crisp"" - we did not eat it, and no one cared.   We will sure go again and hope they will do better next time.

2023-05-21,Emma N,"Wow! I consider myself somewhat of a foodie. I’ve eaten in a lot of fancy restaurants in various cities around the globe in my 53 years on this planet.  However - I can honestly say that I’ve never eaten pasta like this (even in Italy). It’s the Texture! This is much more than a question of the correct al dente cooking time.  Something more is going on here. That aside, the accompanying sauce and ingredients were mouth wateringly delicious 😋  I actually feel like I’ve just properly experienced great pasta for the very first time!  We started our meal with a swordfish kebab. This was expertly cooked, succulent and very tasty. I could’ve eaten another plate, it was so good! There was not a free table in the house. As soon as one group of diners left, they were quickly replaced by another lot. I’m not surprised. This place is a little gem just minutes away from Venice Beach. Great vibe, cool interior and great service. What a find on our trip to LA! Amazing 🤩",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r891349363-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,5,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2022-06-26,Michael B,"I've been to Felix many times in the past few years and though it was one of the better Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. Unfortunately last night's visit was disappointing. Perhaps things are different since COVID but the quality of the food was just not there. The stuffed squash blossoms are still a perfect appetizer, but I thought they were over-salted. The wonderful pizzas, from what I remember in the past, this time had a gooey-like consistency to the dough and also tasted soggy. Our pastas fared better though I thought the tagliatelle was overcooked and the orchiette dish is much better at Mozza. I also think the new prices on the menu are very steep. $30+ for a pizza or pasta dish is just very steep. Overall, the service was very good and the patio was a nice option for pleasant summer evening but the noise level was quite loud and it really wasn't necessary to also have the music on at the same time. It was difficult to hear my dinner colleagues across the table. I've had some really wonderful meals at Felix in the past. Maybe it was a rough night in the kitchen, but I probably won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r844746606-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,3,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2022-04-08,Samantha R,"Visited with two dear girlfriends and while we couldn’t get a great time (5pm) because you can only reserve within 7 days of the date you want, it was a very pleasant experience. We had two salads and three pasta dishes to share. Note- for 3 people that was quite alot of food. Add the famous olive oil and herbed bread as a starter and you’ll be full for days. The service was great. The servers are all very well trained and recite the menu like pros. I must point out one exceptional staff member and that is Megan the bar manager/director. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine list, which is crazy extensive and expensive, but when you pay $32 for a bowl of pasta what’s a $74 bottle of excellent Pinot noir? My one slightly negative comment would be Felix’s rigidity. You must put in your entire order at once and they don’t do any substitutions. They also limit your dining time. My party of 3 had two hours to eat and drink and when we were over by about 20 minutes we were given our check and gently told there was another reservation waiting. Felix has become a Venice staple and if you want excellent pasta from an excellent chef, go and check it out. Just be prepared to eat within a time limit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r833882111-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,4,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2021-08-07,GioG1727,"I am Italian and I was lucky enough to visit some of the best restaurant beside my home, in Italy and around the world. I am from the region where the chef of Felix was trained at least on the home-making pasta. A friend of mine wanted me to try this one and here are my comments: Ambiance: I didn’t see the inside as we had the reservation outside in the patio. The patio though was pretty basic (simple wood table and simple light bulbs across the ceiling). I don’t know if this was done in a hurry to accommodate customers while in the middle of the Covid crisis. Food: we had 3 flutes of champagne, 3 appetizers (antipasti), 2 pizzas and 3 pastas (primi). The highlight were the Zucchini Ripieni, lightly fried almost tempura style. Then it went downhill pretty fast from there. The Polpette were salty (mortadella e parmigiano overpowering) and the fincione was more like a maritozzo romano (sweet) than a real fincione. What is the hype about this bread is beyond me. It shouldn’t be sweet. Appetizers didn’t arrive at the same time, my Polpette landed when the other antipasti were finished. Not good! The pizzas arrived warm and the outside (cornicione) was chewy while the inside mushy. It sounded like rewarmed. Not good at all. I Primi: i Rigatoni all’amatriciana were undercooked and I know what al-dente should be like. They are missing 2 minutes in the water. The rest, a Cacio e Pepe and the Pappardelle al Ragu’ pretty normal (Everybody knows how to cook Italian could do the same – read the Artusi book). 3 glass of wine at the price of gold, a Tiramisu too sweet and another desert that my wife had with an ice-cream uneventful (she didn’t finish it). I think it was a tart. Man oh man it was low. The service: too many servers stepping on each other toes. We had probably 5-6 people working our table. Really! The timing: you feel that the whole menu is built around fast and easy to make or pre-prepared dishes to get people out of the door within the allotted time and for the price they are asking it is just shameful. Had I spent $120 for the whole meal it would have been a non-event, flat meal but still a nonevent, but for $600 hell no. I would have had no problem to spend that kind of money for an excellent quality meal but not for this. I can do way better myself at home and that was the most disappointing things. There was nothing special about this meal. Any trattoria in Emilia-Romagna and maybe a bunch of Italian restaurants in LA would do the same if not better for a fifth of the price. People giving 5 stars to this restaurant, I guess, either were eating Italian for the first time or they were there more for the hype of the restaurant and/or had money to waste. Of course there is no point in going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r802334185-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,2,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

2020-11-08,Shanelle,"Perennially popular Italian restaurant on Abbot Kinney known for handmade pastas. This is a good spot for special occasions or a date night. They’re currently open during covid for outdoor dining on their patio; reservations can be made up to 7 days in advance, and for a party of four, are available in 2 hour increments. Cards are accepted, masks are required, and parking will suck because it’s in Venice, but you might get lucky and find a residential parking spot if you’re there early enough.   Food wise, everything is delicious. The servers will recommend you get 6-8 dishes for a party of four, but I think those with lighter appetites could easily do with 4-5 dishes. The plates may look small, but the food is super filling. Here’s the lowdown on what we got:  Sfcionne: round bread baked with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh herbs. A lot of people on Yelp seemed to recommend it; glad I tried it for the first time, but it’s not necessary.   Pizze Calabrese: there’s quite a few pizza options, and no one can ever say no. They cut the pizza into quarters and the dough was delicious. The ‘nduja was spicy and the cheese was slightly sweet.   Tagliatelle: a must-get and one of the most popular pastas. The pasta was chewy and covered in a silky ragu - hands down the table’s favorite  Rigatoni: large and al dente, the guanciale seemed a bit clumped together but it was a solid pasta.   Busiate: personally my second favorite; it had crushed almonds and I really enjoyed the fatness of the pasta. The cherry tomatoes were fresh and burst into bright flavors in your mouth.   Orecchiette: good to get for meat lovers, as it comes with plenty of sausage.   Budino: creamy and only slightly sweet - it’s comes with a cloud of whipped cream on top that’s almost like a marscapone cheese   Overall, a really delicious meal - it’s easy to see why this is a super popular restaurant on the West Side.

2020-10-28,Ivan K,"Our group visits LA restaurants that are highlighted in critics reviews and articles.  Although we don’t always totally agree, mostly they are valuable and on the mark.  We were excited to try out Felix given its high ratings. Maybe this was an aberration but it was not at all impressive and in fact quite disappointing in many respects. We all at first gave it good, but I think it was because it was pricey and we hated to say otherwise as we would feel a little foolish.  But as the evening went on, each of us had some negative comments.        First, the food took awhile to come out and it did sporadically with our mains separated by 10 minutes or so, to a point where we encouraged each other to eat before it got cold.  A few orders were forgotten all together with apologies by the waitress.       Now to the food. The focaccia was warm, fragrant, chewy and delicious, although a little less olive oil on top would be better.  The zucchini blossoms were the highlight of the meal.  The meatballs were recommended but there were so salty to a point that   the meat was hard to taste.  My ragu bolognes was so salty that I could only eat half.  Again the pesto on my wife’s dish was lip puckering.  The porcini pasta dish was “ good” according to my friend and the other pastas were given very good marks.       The desserts were again good but not memorable.  The other unusual aspect is they do not allow you to bring wine and when you review the extensive Italian wine list, you will be hard pressed to find any bottle under $100.  When checked with the Delectable app on my phone, the markup on their wines are around 3 times retail, again a little pricey.  Which leads me to my objection which is overall the prices are just very high.  You will find the average pasta dish is around $33 and although hand made.  We have been to many of the highly rated Italian restaurants in many cities and for the money as well as the food, I can not recommend dining here.  I feel badly saying that, but I do feel it’s justified at least with our experience tonight.  Again, maybe it was an aberration but I feel salt is put heavily on food to mask a weakness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r775908824-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,2,en,person_2_removed_line_breaks

The concept of farm to table was greatly appreciated and there was innovative use of simple ingredients together to create an explosion of flavours. We loved it!!  We had dined the previous night at a two Michelin starred restaurant and found Auberge de Montmin to actually be much nicer. If you’re looking for stuffy, stuck up and incredibly attentive to service, this might not be for you. HOWEVER, if you’re going for a more casual, homely and ultimately splendid flavours I cannot recommend this enough. The two ladies who took care of us were incredibly pleasant and friendly and the food just speaks for itself.

2019-09-21,Kim P,"A group of 5 dined together for lunch at this very special and recently opened family-owned restaurant. Three of us were brought by local friends who did not look at the menu before making our reservation. We have some food allergies and aversions which have resulted in a narrow choice of food options. When we arrived we found a charming patio with spectacular views.  We were seated by Sandrine (who I believe is the wife of the chef).  We were given a prix fixe menu with roughly 8 family-style courses for 38 euros per person. There was not a single item on the menu that our daughter could eat, and for me, I could eat a few things and for my husband the same.  We were also not very hungry ( I had planned to order just a small salad).  So here we were, for the next 2 + hours with a beautiful view and really not able to eat the food the sweet waitress was bringing.  I totally understand and respect what the restaurant is wanting to do and think that they are very talented and serve fresh and innovative dishes.  I just wish we would have known and would have saved this gem for another time. When the bill came, the sly friends left it for us to pay.  We essentially wasted 120 euros plus some very exquisite food, plus I felt terrible for Sandrine having to bring the wasted food back to the kitchen.  I am writing this as an apology to them and advise to those with a limited diet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3528948-d17727911-r711669657-L_auberge_De_Montmin-Montmin_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

The room is intimate, our favorite style, but unfortunately a little noisy.  On the dishes there are many flowers, plants, fruits, all worked with noble products. Tomato pie could be a birthday cake, of such beauty!  The negatives: if the third star is envisaged, you will have to review the toilet... There is no special attention for an event to celebrate and the menu is not printed (for those who like to keep it as a souvenir it will be sent to you by email). The Chef is present in the room throughout the meal, but does not come to see his guests at the end. For those who love gastronomy this moment of rewarding exchange is not negligible!  The two desserts we had were almost identical in terms of taste, presentation and even texture: there is one too many that should be replaced by cuteness (which we do not have with hot drinks).

2023-12-28,Axel d,"We went to the Montmin hostel when it didn't have any stars. It was the most beautiful culinary discovery possible. I was captivated by a tomato tart even though it is very far from my usual tastes. And the rest was at the same level. We have returned several times, always with the fear of disappointment.

2024-10-14,Susan in Toronto,Beautiful room on the second floor of a barn like structure.  The meal was excellent - we did the wine pairing as well which was very generous.  While the experience was excellent we will likely not return - did not feel it was worth the money we paid and we would have appreciated more local Ontario items on the menu.    We were provided with a menu at the end but it would have been better to have it at the beginning so you could refer to it as you were eating - the servers explained each meal but by the time they left the table we had forgotten most of the ingredients.  And the $6 charge for tea left a bad taste given what we had paid for the meal - surely the restaurant can afford to absorb that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r973893130-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2024-10-05,cctyu68,"With weather still unseasonably warm and comfortable, it is nice to take advantage and venture outside of the normal GTA core for an occasional chowdown or two. For me, PM is the only trusted out-of-town, fine dining establishment featuring a tasting menu option that is within reasonable driving distance from home. Most of all, their offering reflects the quintessential in ‘ farm-to-table’ dining, incorporating a total culinary package that is always consistent, assuring and exceptional…..and now the trademark of a double Michelin Red and Green stars recipient!  It has been almost a year since I last drove out to PM and savored the wonderful and ever-changing creative cuisine of PM’s ‘ dynamic duo chefs ‘ - Daniel Hadida and Eric Robertson…….not to mention visiting their flocks of free range chicken and ducks, grass fed cattles and the impressive vegetable and herb garden!  For the past three decades, due to the close proximity of our birthdays, my brother-in-law and I had been holding regular annual, husband-only, joint birthday bashes at different venues all over Ontario and Quebec. Fine dining establishments with tasting menus and wine pairing offerings were our preferred venue options. This year, meeting our primary criteria with ease, we decided to pay PM a long overdue re-visit! Our luncheon culinary experience started off with a walk around the restaurant complex, a close encounter with some free-run ‘ Silken Chicken ‘ and a sampling of Chardonnay grapes from the 2024 harvest! Very ripe and sweet! IMHO, it could be a very good vintage year!  As in the past, after climbing the challenging ‘32 steps‘ flight of stairs to the spectacular upper level dining room, we were welcomed warmly by both chefs, outside of the open-kitchen. This time, with added significance, since we are shaking hands with Michelin star chefs!  In light of growing health and safety concerns, we have decided to pass on the wine pairing option. In lieu of, we both settled for a glass of their house-special Champagne plus a glass of their very aromatic, 2019 ‘ Irreverance ‘ ( Orange Riesling, Chardonnay & Gewurztraminer ). The creative dishes of our 12-course ‘Omakase’ tasting menu were visually impressive and relishing. The masterful menu was well thought of and conceived, featuring a balanced and diverse offering of dishes with a focus on seafood and pasture raised fowls and animals. Most dishes feature major components with complex and multidimensional taste profiles, augmented with an interesting array of vegetable sides. The ‘ too beautiful to disturb and eat ‘ artful plating elevated to an even higher level than before. Again, some never before seen or tasted, uncommon ‘organic‘ ingredients adorned our plates ( eg., local ‘Golden’ Strawberries, ‘Autumn’ Petit Pois! )……the advantage of owning a herb/vegetable garden and close proximity to local farms! To reflect their recipient of the Green Star, I was told by the chefs, ALL ingredients used from now on, especially the vegetables, will be organically grown either in-house or locally. The protein, local, organic, wild or free run!  Coupled with impeccable, warm and friendly front-of-house service and care, our near perfect meal was once again foodie and praise worthy. My ONLY very minor and superficial criticism pertains to the slight ‘overhanded‘ use of salt in the delectable sauces of a few dishes….the Lobster, the Cod and the Duck. No big deal! Part of living in an imperfect world!!  Looking forward to returning for the Fall menu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r972722789-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

2024-01-20,mismanagement,"Very tasteful looking restaurant, although could not see the outside as we dined during a winter snow storm. Service as would be expected excellent, attentive, very knowledgeable staff, professional yet friendly and relaxed. Happy to talk at the table with confidence. Dishes were presented by both chefs and servers, i love to see the kitchen involved in the service, all showed pride and excitement with their food.  Worth noting no full bar only a limited range of certain spirits... no mixers. However you go to PM for the food, ranked in Top 5 restaurants in Canada so I had high expectations and as Jools had visited in Summer last year and been blown away, I was expecting something special. Did i get it?? Sorry, not quite. Yes there were 3 or 4 real stand out dishes of the 10 course tasting menu, but it just did not live up to the hype. Was it due to it being winter and the seasonal produce available?  Look, experience was still very good, just not great. Stand outs... Bision Tartare, wow, melt in the mouth, lovely flavor. Nubian Goat, tender, strong flavor. Rasberry Sobet in Meringue, gapow!! Intense flavor, crispy meringue.  But then course 10, a ""Babka"", a nice Babka but what was it doing at the end of the meal, too heavy, poor menu planning, I'd have left it as a nine course tasting menu.  I'll try again in the summer and hope for a more balanced ""seasonal"" menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r934813646-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,4,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

Rated in the top 100 restaurants in Canada the last couple of years, however did they pull that off with the meal we were served!?? Drunk food critiques? Paid off food critiques?? From start to finish we had excellent service! Provided you could hear them or understand them explaining the dishes they served you. A 10 course meal, I had my friend all hyped up about this new restaurant for her to try……unfortunately I felt embarrassed for bring her there for an evening that was suppose to be a magical food experience but still was an expensive comedy relief for us to enjoy each others company and guess which one of the servers cooked the dish that was being served to us! For it certainly could not possibly been a chef!  Possible a chef with a head cold because there was very little flavour in anything! The pork dish served was so tough you had a hard time cutting it and then chew chew chew …. A dish served with “Hogget” what is Hogget you may ask? It is a lamb that is to be between 12-18 months old….my guess it was old enough to vote! It was so tough you could not cut it, and then it came down to chew and swallow , or chew and spit out! A dish with Geoduck in it ….unfortunately mine had a bit of grit in it, probably sand….flash back of sand box at preschool …. There was not one dish that you would say OMG that was incredible! Although I did get my friend to say it by asking her to close her eyes when tasting one of the sauces and said picture campbells cream of mushroom soup, to which she replied OMG the chef must be standing back laughing his ass off at all these people eating this campbells soup! To which we both burst out laughing. Thank goodness we could laugh because at a price tag of $492 for the two of us , with no alcohol …we needed some humor for the wasted evening! If you could live on sour dough bread you will make out fine! The bread was the best part of the meal, and had most of the flavour!

2023-08-06,torontotraveller939,Dining at RPM was a unique experience.  The restaurant is housed in what appears to be a barn in the middle of a farm in the wine district of Ontario. The interior has been transformed into a sleek and modern restaurant with views over the farm.  We were served a ten course prix fixe tasting menu which was simply spectacular in terms of taste and presentation with each course carefully explained by the outstanding staff. All of the courses were sourced from their own and neighbouring farms. RPM is very close to a major highway and can easily be accessed.

2023-06-07,kameezel,"I wanted to be blown away by this experience and was not. It was very, very good, but not great, and definitely not spectacular. The food was tasty, beautifully presented, and appropriately priced for what it was but nothing made me think omg, this is the best thing ever. When we do a tasting menu like this, I expect at least one of those moments. there was also a missed opportunity for an amuse bouche and final dinner sweet with the bill which is pretty standard for meals like this, in my experience. The service was wonderfully friendly, but not stellar -- towards the end of the meal we had three sets of empty wine glasses on the table which wasn't terrible, but not expected for a venue of this quality and reputation.  I have to comment on the wine pairings because I tried to get some advance info on them from reviews and wasn't very successful. If money is no object, by all means it was interesting and I'm sure we tasted some things we'd not find elsewhere. But 6 2oz glasses of wine which were tasty and well matched, but not exceptional, for $135 is nuts. We didn't look at the regular wine menu because this was a special occasion and we'd decided in advance to do the pairings,  so I can't say what wine by the glass (or even bottle) cost, but my recommendation would be to have a look at the wine menu and get the sommelier to suggest 2 or 3 glasses to match the menu. The space itself is lovely and spacious, and having service included in the prices is a really nice touch. Again, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience -- it was a lovely night out, and I have no regrets, but it was not a life changing meal, and I've had those for a similar or lower price. I hope this is helpful for anyone who is waffling about making a reservation or choosing to go with the wine pairings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r893930315-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,4,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

2022-10-27,travellingdining,"This is Pearl Morissette's last month outdoors under their tent and we were glad to have experienced it. Prepared for a chilly evening, we found the tent to be pleasantly warm (even without the available blankets) and very inviting. What was greenery spreading over the ceiling in summer, is now delicately dried and brown--but it suits the fall weather and candlelit atmosphere.  Servers and staff are well-trained and attentive, pleasant and very accommodating. Due to an allergy at our table (they asked at time of booking), the kitchen had prepared special dishes without certain ingredients (eggs & milk). In one case, the altered dish was better than the original!  That said, all the food was terrific-- imaginative, complementary flavour combinations created using as much local product as possible, including many ingredients grown on the farm surrounding the restaurant. Even with ingredients like sablefish (aka black cod) which can sometimes have an overwhelming taste, the fusion of flavours was excellent.  The wine list is extensive, although we opted for the wine pairing. Our sommelier was well-versed and interested in giving us the best experience possible. She even changed up one pairing to something she thought we would better enjoy, based on our comments as dinner went on. Over all, this was a beautiful evening and one we greatly enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r866192281-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

Their dishes are creative, the flavour combinations are unique and the plating is lovely. The wine pairings are perfect; a combination of local and international vintages were excellent complements to the food. The servers are polite, unobtrusive and pleasant. Such care is taken with allergies (they ask in advance), that the chefs redesign some dishes to accommodate food sensitivities at a particular table.  We ate outdoors in the enclosed tent, which was comfortable and warm, despite the near freezing weather that night. Minimalist decor with an emphasis on plants and nature were the perfect setting for the meal which relies heavily on local ingredients, especially those grown on the farm immediately outside.

2022-08-23,Nanap777,"I really wanted to give this restaurant a good review and waited a week after visit to “process” the experience. Although it was good overall, it just didn’t meet our expectations. To me a good restaurant is a place where you would want to go back and I can’t say that I want to return to Pearl Morissette. I’m a foodie and unfortunately this experience was just a check mark on my “bucket list”.  Good service and great atmosphere, very romantic. The food portions were small. I mean really small. One of the courses was two tiny baby potatoes. I don’t expect a place like that to have big portions, but you do want to feel at least half satisfied after a meal. We though since it was nine course meal we’d feel different towards the end but then the deserts came and we were disappointed.  I’m very picky when it comes to food and I liked most dishes but there were few that I didn’t. The duck was a bit too rare, very chewy. It is just my opinion but all four of us thought ot would be nice if it was cooked just a bit longer.  I feel bad giving this place 3 star review because had good time. But on the other hand after 4 months wait and the most expensive meal I’ve ever had I feel there is something missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562672-d13168199-r855914932-Restaurant_Pearl_Morissette-Jordan_Station_Lincoln_Ontario.html,3,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

2024-10-16,Sightsee35489831140,"Booked as a treat well in advance during a holiday trip to Northumberland. Saturday is the only lunch service they offer. Located in an airy upstairs space in a converted barn with 8 or so tables facing an open kitchen where 5 chefs worked away. The tasting menu comprises something like 18 courses; many of which are single bite expediences, Each course was served by one of the chefs team explaining the ingredients  and techniques behind it. They were all very friendly and approachable an we had some extended conversations about a range of topics. The food is very clever, original and inventive as well as being tasty and enjoyable. All in all a great experience with a very committed and passionate brigade seeking to create new flavours in the wilds of Northumberland. A lot of produce comes from the kitchen garden and two polytunnels with produce grown and selected by the chefs themselves. very friendly and efficient waiting staff. We were there for 3 hours 20 minutes and the food is very well paced.

2024-09-13,Never2Old,"Visited Restaurant Pine to celebrate Tim’s 60th birthday as a couple.  The meal at Restaurant Pine was as perfect as we had hoped it would be. Such a magical experience. Granted, you have to be a foodie and perhaps watch Master Chef on repeat to appreciate the creativity, expertise and talent involved in each impeccable course. The photographs and each title of the over 18 item course menu does not do the food justice but please have a gander. Every morsel was filled with expertly sourced flavour - sometimes unusual and, most of the time, foraged from the local environment. I couldn’t keep up with the amount of wild plants that  were included. Even the menu can be planted in the garden to release the wild flower seeds within.  Here are photos of BBQ Shiso and Sugar Kelp - you  have to put the whole think in your mouth and it just bursts with flavour; Berwick Edge, Dry Aged Carrot and Horseradish - same pop in mouth technique and the carrot has the texture of meat. It has taken months to prepare; Asparagus, Sunflower and Sorrell - first of the season and gorgeous - caramelised sunflower seeds on a bed of miso cream with sorrell leaves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r969647903-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

From the moment we entered the front of house staff were attentive, amazingly knowledgeable and so friendly. We had a lovely non alcoholic cocktail in the bar. They continued to provide an amazing service throughout, checking in about drinks, topping up water and chatting about drinks and wines on offer.   The restaurant itself is in beautiful Northumberland and from the restaurant you have countryside views all around.   The kitchen is open and it was a privilege to watch the chef team prepare the incredible menu. The precision and skill on display was amazing.   The food was delicious, mostly local providers or from the garden kitchen or the wilds of Northumberland. Each course was well thought out and surprising flavours and textures!

Both were open to questions & the atmosphere was friendly & relaxed. The food was amazing. Each course more intricate than the one before.The abundance of freshly made bread was a win win with John 😂 The broth, I could have taken a flask full with us when we left. I even tried to negotiate a trade for some rhubarb root 😉 John had the soft flight of non alcoholic drinks to accompany his dishes, I had the alcoholic wine with mine 🍷 Each variety expertly delivered by the sommelier.

2024-07-17,Turia,"Visited here while walking the Hadrian’s Wall Path which passes through East Wallhouses. My companion, being an avid follower of the Great British Menu and Cal Byerley, was overjoyed to discover this restaurant was so close to where we were staying one night and insisted on taking me to experience some top quality fine dining. I must admit I was initially reluctant due to the price. However, I was completely blown away by the whole experience. We were met at the door by a friendly lady and spent a pleasant time in the cozy bar where the Sommelier helped us choose some wine. All very laid back and relaxed and no one seemed perturbed by me wearing my (clean) walking gear. The restaurant is a good size for the small number of tables which are well spaced out with the open kitchen in the corner. It was fascinating to watch the chefs creating each dish, sometimes it seemed like a ballet was taking place in the kitchen. Each dish was introduced and explained in detail as it was delivered to the table. This was my first experience of a tasting menu and I must say that every dish was fantastic. The presentation, flavour and texture of the food was incredible. Even the bread and butter were the best I have ever tasted. Many of the dishes were an interpretation of something familiar but in an original and unique way, providing some real insight into what food can be like. I was certainly impressed. The atmosphere in the restaurant remained relaxed throughout with attentive but not intrusive front of house staff. Overall, a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r959914478-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2024-07-15,Lee B,"What a hidden gem this restaurant is, my first visit to Pine and by no means will it be my last. The restaurant is located in the most calming of settings which immediately reduces your heart rate as you enter the friendly and bright dining area. You have a clear view of the open kitchen meaning you can enjoy watching these talented chefs.   I can confirm the food was out of this world, flavoursome, unique and very enjoyable. The wine pairing I had has to be one of my very favourites I’ve ever had, the knowledge and enjoyment I got from the wonderful Vanessa was second to none. She really knows her stuff.   All of the team were very friendly and you could tell how relaxed all guests are, all created by the brilliant team.

2024-06-27,Sarahanne08,"We choose Pine as a result of watching Cal on the Great British Menu. We wanted to know more about Restaurant Pine because we were  inspired by their approach to producing great food. We wanted to have the whole experience so included wine pairing and we were not disappointed.  Pine was a treat for my birthday and from start to finish the experience was  without doubt a memorable experience.  Previous positive reviews discuss the quality, presentation and ambiance and we concur with their views. Its such a relaxed, friendly place that you feel so much at home.  We had our favourite courses, including, Wild Sea Trout, Dried Aged Carrot & Horseradish, King Edwards Potato, Sour Dough Bread, Beetroot, Doddington Cheddar & Walnut , etc. Maybe I just say what my least favourite tastes were. So you are probably getting the impression it was a fantastic menu. However, least favourite is just based on personal taste.  I think what really enhanced our experience was our wine sommelier's. They explained the reasoning behind the choice of wine, history and location. We know a little bit about wine, but we learnt so much.  We sat at the chef table and had a lovely opportunity to watch the team prepare the the courses. They are so organised and it was a pleasure to watch. I would love to have them on Christmas Day.  The icing on the cake was the lovely birthday card signed by all the team and Peach Cake which was a lovely gift for my birthday. The experience in terms of value for money is subjective. We felt it was great value for money based on the in-depth preparation of the ingredients to support the each individual course . We will visit again next year. Thank you to the whole team.

2024-04-06,ian85jones,"What can I say about my first visit to Pine in Northumberland ……….wow …it was just pure magic !  It is hidden in a farm industrial complex 8 miles from Newcastle on Hadrians wall , not a normal spot for a top end eating establishment ….but without any shadow of a doubt this is top end in terms of imaginative , clever , often brilliant cooking .  You are taken on a journey of sustainable ingredients throughout the menu which never stops giving in terms of bursts of flavour …….with lots of surprises .   Simple ingredients,  locally sourced can produce extraordinary dishes …..the bbq bream , the King Edward potato dish , the Hogget broth , the Scallop dish the honeycomb desert all totally fantastic and I could mention many more things I loved .  But a good eating place needs a good vibe and a great atmosphere and the team at Pine are a great bunch of people , a great team led by Sian and Cal ……..but the rest of the team all play there part everyone showing great knowledge and all the food and wine and very friendly and welcoming .

Also really enjoyed watching the food being prepared. Every dish was innovative and mouth-wateringly delicious.

2024-03-19,The Bradcotts,"We have had Pine on our radar for some time now and whilst recently staying in the area we were fortunate to secure a dinner table.  We arrived on a cool, damp, miserable March evening to be warmly welcomed in the parking area by a charming young lady who escorted us to a delightful cosy lounge.  Vanessa, the Sommelier, guided us through the eclectic drinks selection. I particularly enjoyed a pre dinner local wheat beer. Throughout the meal, at Vanessa's suggestion, I enjoyed some quite tasty and unusual reds from Turkey and Greece.  My wife enjoyed an Austrian Gruner Veltliner and a white Pinot Noir from Surrey.  In the dinning area we were seated directly in front of the open plan kitchen where we were able to observe the creation of our extensive culinary adventure.  We were close enough in fact for the two chefs (Ian and colleague) to present and describe each dish at our table.  We've lost count of how many wonderful courses we had, but our favourites, in no particular order, were Pork Chump with Salsify; Snow Ball Turnip; Potato with Cucumber Concentrate and Scallop with Cauliflower and Pear.  The 'piece de resistance' however was the Hogget which we were able to observe the chef nurturing throughout the first half of our meal.  In conclusion, an outstanding experience spread over three hours.  We look forward to our next visit.

2024-02-06,Guys Who Dine,"Dinner Restaurant Pine Northumberland. This restaurant has been on our list for a while. What can be said about this modern venue on a farm? Well, it's multi award winning.  The dining option is a tasting menu of dreams. Menus are reconstituted to make paper and are sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring. All dishes are prepared and served from an open kitchen. We were lucky enough to have a table right in front of all the action.  Service starts with some of the most-mouth watering snacks after snacks before you even get to the bread course. Then comes the Pork Jowl, Celeriac & Preserved Berries,Pork Bone Broth & Hen of the Woods. OMG,we're not even halfway yet. The fish course was a delightful Monkfish, White Asparagus & Sunflower. The main course was Roe-Deer, Larch. Black Garlic & Gooseberry. Followed by desserts.  The evening doesn't stop there. You are invited into the bar where you can order after dinner drinks and served a trio of sweet treats. Pace of service was very slick and well orchestrated, which lasted no longer than three hours.

2024-01-02,Guido-Sol,"A converted old barn in a windswept Northumberland field 14 miles from Newcastle Upon Tyne isn’t traditionally where you’d expect to find a fine dining experience. The restaurant and bar are beautifully crafted.   The agricultural roots of this old barn are still evident, but not negatively so. The dining room is bright, airy and spacious thanks to a vaulted ceiling high overhead, and pride of place is given to the open kitchen, where chefs busy themselves carefully tweezering dishes.  It’s clear that this is a restaurant that cares about the smallest things. Even the menus are a work of art - old menus are reconstituted to make paper for new menus, and sowed with wildflower seeds so guests can plant them in the spring.  The menu is clever in the sense there’s a gradual building of flavour and clear consideration of quantity and pacing.  Service is charming, in a way that makes everything feel effortless and never too much trouble. From front to back. Every dish is explained in exquisite detail. We selected the wine pairing which was brilliantly presented with incredible enthusiasm by the sommelier Vanessa.    In conclusion a very enjoyable evening, delicious food completed by some delightful wine pairings.   Tip.  Don’t worry about securing a taxi for the homeward journey because the staff will take care of everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8535041-d23858771-r932022783-Restaurant_Pine-East_Wallhouses_Northumberland_England.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

So much detail and preparation was evident  with locally sourced  and home grown ingredients which had been dehydrated, fermented and prepared in some cases over months!  The flavours were in some cases just so intense with the beetroot, the charcuterie butternut and the extraordinary parsnip deserts a few of the many highpoints... the wine flight was indeed a flight of exploration  with Vanessa... Welsh wine...who knew? And the soft drink parings for those not drinking a great and again unusual list of really interesting and delightful flavours...  Finally with the open kitchen and the Great service with all the staff and chefs taking turns to talk through the drinks and food just a great experience....thanks to Sian ,Cal,Ian and Vanessa and the rest of your team.

2023-12-18,El Turista John,"First of all, the Wolf’s Tailor was 5 of 5 for food, 5 of five drinks pairing (both wine and non-alcoholic) and 5 of 5 for service. So why not a 5 overall, because for the price and the Michelin Star one doesn’t expect them to forget to deliver a course. Got home, looked at the printed menu they gave us of our meal and  realized one of the dessert courses ( Mignardise) was never plated for our table of 3. And, if you go on their website both places where you click to get in touch are inoperative. So this is the only place I can provide feedback. Which is a poor way to end such an excellent meal and certainly cheapens the value-for-money.  As to the food, WOW!!  The fresh, unique, flavorful, and creative dishes were world class. In the dozens and dozens of Michelin starred restaurants I’ve been to I’ve never had a tartare course, wagyu course or scallop course that tasty and unique. Bravo!!  The wine and non-alcoholic beverages were also superstars of the dining experience. Each wine certainly enhanced the food courses. Our designated driver’s non-alcoholic pairings were the envy of the table. SUPERB!  The wait staff was always professional, friendly and attentive.

2023-05-17,LoafJugThouTree,"Oh, my. We ate at Tavernetta and concluded that it couldn't get much better. WRONG! The Wolf's Tailor is A M A Z I N G. We selected the five-course ""Entrust"" menu. Each course was astoundingly good. I'm sure each course had a name of some kind, but neither my wife nor I can remember what. What we can remember is the description of each dish. Complex? Oh my, yes. And many of the ingredients are provided by a certified forager. The first course, as an example, was almost inedible. Why? The dish looked so beautiful, it was truly a work of culinary art. Eat it? I didn't even want to disturb it! But I did and, no surprise, the tastes were gorgeous. The tab for this glorious menu was $110 per person plus the 22% service fee. Realistically, given what one has to pay for feed-lot beef and poorly cooked vegetables in a steakhouse, $110 per person is a bargain. Actually, given the venue, food, and service, it's a HUGE bargain. Reserve early. It's sold out just about every night.

2023-01-31,JB4854,"The food and service at Wolf Tailor were excellent, but this is not a $$-$$$ dollar restaurant. It is at the very highest end. It is a price fixed restaurant and our bill for two was over four hundred dollars including tip and one drink each. A great experience but our pocketbook certainly won’t permit a second experience. Besides the hefty tab (there is no menu and we had no idea of the cost; we should have asked and they should have told us), it was very cold in the restaurant. Several customers wore there jackets. My wife and I used ours to keep our legs warm. They offered blankets, which indicated they knew it was cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r877055947-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,4,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2023-01-05,Noel D,"What a wonderful dining experience! The tasting menu we experienced was the buckwheat theme, and it was exquisite. Taste, presentation, and innovation were out of this world. There are 7 courses and we left full but not miserably stuffed. The first course was small bites including a buckwheat donut topped with caviar and a sauce that was out of this world. I had venison that was so tender it would melt in your mouth, made-from-scratch soba noodles, buckwheat flatbread with a duck liver pate topping, and amazing desserts. I hate fish and seafood, but I wanted to be adventurous, and I'm so glad I was. There were two courses with fish, and I gobbled them up. All of their ingredients are sourced locally.  Service was fantastic--attentive, thoroughly explained each course, made great drink recommendations to pair with the courses.  Well worth the expense for a special occasion and major foodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r874026800-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2022-09-08,Michael Meyer,"We absolutely loved the experience, food, and the wait staff.  I chose this spot for my wife's birthday dinner, and I stated that on our reservation. The female Somalia was incredible, concise, knowledgeable, and beyond professional. Exactly the caliber of staff I would expect from a ""culinary experience""   The start to the night was not ideal, the male waiter we had was very nice, professional, and on top of it. For the start of the experience though, I would say they need more training.  I pre-purchased our dinner, and drinks. When he approached us, he asked if we had been there before. We answered no, and he began running through how the ordering experience is and such, I cut in and explained I ordered everything ahead of time. I was surprised that he was not aware of that before coming to the table,   (I would recommend recording that information and adding it to the reservation to improve the experience for the customer, or make that apart of your spiel)  After the first interaction   He came back with our water and stated ""oh yes you did, would you like to put those drinks in?"" which added to our confusion. I asked him ""I paid for the mixed drinks and food ahead of time, I thought this was all paired together for the taste"" His response was ""oh you can put in something else too, and your other drinks will come out once we get started""   Naturally I asked, when do we get started? He responded ""whenever you are ready""   At this point I was a little frustrated as there was a lack of ""setting the stage"" and small details were being left out.   I asked for a proper overview, felt better after that, but the impression was made.   At this point I was hopeful it would get better, and the rest of the experience? Incredible. The male waiter from here was on top of EVERYTHING, didn’t miss a single beat. The others were all very knowledgeable and helpful.   The final dish was the dessert, we personally did not like it very much but it was interesting. I would have preferred to swap #7 with #5 as #5 (if I'm remembering the number right) would have made a savory finish, but who cares what I think and it was all incredible.   My wife and I are not big holiday and birthday people, we like to celebrate quietly with one another and we really appreciate that the staff did not make a big deal out of it as I forgot to leave a note to keep it a quiet affair.  Really appreciate the candle and no singing!    The ambiance:  I chose the patio/garden as I thought it would be the coolest/cutest. It was not what I expected, I expected a quieter more romantic setting.  To set the stage, you have to enter through the patio/garden instead of the front door. The garden area has fresh herbs they are growing that are actively used in the meals. Which is awesome! However because you need to enter through here, people are constantly coming and going. There are some tents for some privacy, but we did not get one and sat next to some people that were pleasant enough, but a little loud and played stuff over their phones a couple times. It was unfortunately distracting.   The way I read about Wolfs Tailor was a romantic culinary experience, and it is beyond a doubt a wonderful experience, however I will say if you're expecting a romantic couples dinner for a one on one like experience, you and your partner will just have to be the people that block others out. We did and had a great time, I just wish the experience was more so nurtured   Also the speaker above one of the tables was too loud, they were happy to turn it down, but one of those things. I also found that the music was poorly chosen for the ambiance, too loud and aggressive.  It was rhythmic and interesting, but not the right setting. For example I personally love metal music, but I wouldn't play it at a house party as it's not the right setting.   I would say overall it’s a 8/10 experience that had some detractors, the staff, food, and drinks all made it worth it.  Final take aways and .02c   Instruct your staff to set the stage for the experience better Softer music choice, less volume on that speaker as it kept my ears ringing for the night Garden seating could be a bit darker, or create more seclusion",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r859117015-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,4,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2022-09-05,TessDC,"Celebrating a wedding anniversary, a birthday, and a visit from family members all rolled into one spectacular night.  We did the entrust tasting menu with wine pairings. I didn't think anything could top the bento box but all seven courses were equally spectacular. Of the wine pairings, I only disliked one wine (everyone else loved it). I even liked the chardonnay - perfectly paired with the amazing pasta and homemade bread - and I don't normally like chardonnay.   Service was top-notch from the moment we walked in. I loved how we got a short discussion about the food and wine with each course.   We left informed, spoiled, the exact right amount of tipsy (but not me as the DD!), full but not overly so, and happy as two clams at high tide.   We packed a lot of events and food in while my foodie B and S-In-L were in town, and this was the highlight of the week for us all.  Photos are subpar and we were so excited to dive into every new plate that we forgot a few.   Well worth the cost for the extra happiness on my family's faces.

2021-09-15,Merlin C,"How might a wolf choose to dress himself, given the opportunity? A tuxedo to hide his ferocity? Perhaps that’s the very idea at The Wolf’s Tailor. An unassuming look to hide Denver’s finest meal.   We were in town celebrating a very special occasion called life. We arrived at dusk and walked to the back of the restaurant, passing greenhouses and gardens. We checked-in and began a well-choreographed procession. Things flowed at The Wolf’s Tailor: time, food, alcohol, and happiness. We started off with whiskey highballs. They were light and fresh and made with a Suntory sparkling water machine. A whiskey cocktail that’s astonishingly refreshing. Tell me the last time you had one of those. Seriously, tell me about it. I’d love to try it because this one was delightful.  One of us got the wine pairing, while the other got the cocktail pairing. It’s hard not to make this review a Shakespear novel, so I’ll just say the drinks were phenomenal. A drink I still daydream about had green chartreuse, cold pressed pineapple juice syrup, and more of that Suntory sparkling water I keep hearing so much about. Highlights from the omakase were the roast chicken meatballs (pure Roy Choi!), the huckleberries fermented in sake for 7 days (what happens after 7 days? No one knows!), and the everything bagel naan (you read that right!).   Skewered spot prawns would have stolen the show if not for halibut served in a lime, citrus broth that resembled pho with fresh dill atop. The halibut may have been poached for all I know. Good grief, let me come back and try it again please! My tuxedo hid nothing. I drank the broth like a savage because it was too pleasing to let go. I ate the rest of my partner’s halibut and drank their broth after mine. I had become the wolf.   Somewhere amid this dizzying comfort of taste and fullness, we had homemade rigatoni made from house milled grains, and a buffalo tartare that deserves its own essay, and somewhere after all that I believe I ate a deconstructed dessert after a constructed dessert. Dessert after dessert. We’d gone too far to stop. We can never stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d15851112-r810164932-The_Wolf_s_Tailor-Denver_Colorado.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

2020-03-11,Rouxtonne,"I had the tasting menu and wine pairing. The portions are smaller, but I wouldn't have wanted any more for each course as I was struggling to finish by the end (and I have a big appetite). Out of the tasting menu the pasta course was my least favorite, but I'm not a big pasta fan, but that in no way meant it was bad. I really enjoyed the Asian inspired dishes. Good sake pairing. The ambiance is great  - there's a year-round outdoor fire pit out front that is a nice gathering place even in winter time. Had a great server that was the appropriate amount of attentive. The restaurant was full, but not overly noisy or cramped. I enjoyed the light touches of molecular gastronomy throughout the meal - I'm a nerd for this stuff.

2019-08-18,berdafina,"Very high quality, luxurious, outstanding. Fully deserves its two Michelin stars. No regrets here.   All the food is excellent : very refined and light, tasty, varied. With exceptionally good dishes such as : Consommé of Morcilla tapa;  main course of Pigeon stuffed with leak & mushroom, on a mixed vegetable base, in a rich sauce, with mustard, broccoli trunk & soufflé potatoes; and a pre-dessert of citric Passion Fruit and Yogurt Ice-cream stuffed with Mango and Apple.  Only small complaints, the exploding mustard balls with the pigeon, and the slightly heavy Raviole starter.   All the glasses of wines proposed with the menu are very good.   High calibre service, plentiful staff, and warm welcome. Although the head waiter can come over as a bit as tense and cold. For example, not offering an aperitif upon arrival.   Before arriving at your table, one is offered an original tour of the manor, including through the wine cellar and its own bakery, with a visit to two different salons for aperitifs.   Relaxing atmosphere, in a very nice, interesting building, leaving an impression of tradition with a modern touch. Well spaced tables, and well frequented that lunch-time.

2017-09-03,DuchessadiNapoli,"We need an English commentary here as Google translations are incomprehensible. FOR: This restaurant deserves its Michelin stars: the cuisine is excellent. The staff are attentive. The place is impressive,the building historic. If you are a gourmet, or a professional food expert/writer, you will probably enjoy this experience. AGAINST: The cuisine is complex. Nothing is simple. Dishes are served in small elegant portions - don't come here if you are hungry, or suffer from a healthy appetite! Be prepared for a large bill: elegance has its price. The staff is very attentive and polite but service is slow: over two hours for lunch may be enjoyed by some, but for older people it can be an ordeal. Service is choreographed: I find it over the top and would prefer a more down-to-earth approach. If I want choreography I go to the ballet. The building is in an out-of-the-way village which is badly signposted. We drove for miles - be sure to have an efficient sat nav.

2016-11-06,steadyslack,"Came for lunch at 13:30. Lovely welcome by multilingual staff. 3 menus to choose from: 3 course a la carte, 9 and 13 course tasting menu for € 55, €75, €105 respectively. We chose the latter. It was a 3 hour experience.  In retrospect we should have chosen the smaller tasting menu as the one we had was rather too much! Ask for the main dining room and not the side room as it's brighter and more interesting. Great place, fab staff and great food.

2016-08-10,Stevendlv,"In a village just off the main roads one can find the beautiful Centador de Amos. There is the event location on the far end of the property that I can only imagine to be a dream wedding location. There is plenty of parking space and there are hosts waiting to welcome you into the venue. It makes you feel right at home and it is immediately clear that this will be a treat. As we did not speak Spanish they made sure there was always someone who spoke english to ensure we could comfortably ask any question and were offered an English menu.   We started with a choice of one of the set menus outside in the lounge where we chose the middle menu “Esencia” (75E IVA included). We were taken to a bigger room inside where a few other tables were already enjoying their lunch. The tables were well spaced for enough privacy and every guest seemed to feel just as much of a special guest. The servers made their best effort to make some small talk, but were mostly very unobtrustive and were right there anytime you would like something or even right before. The timing was great for every dish and the teamwork was astonishing.   The food was amazing, especially the amuses and appetizers were out of this world. The “Caramelized Foie”, “Coastal Tuna” were among my personal highlights as well as the regional favourite of Sardines only this time in a modern setting. All the dishes were quite a large portion so don’t worry about going home hungry.. Also because of the bread that was supplied which also tasted amazing. I won’t give away too much on the contents as the tastes were quite surprising but never unpleasant. After the dinner we were seated in the sun in the lounge again and enjoyed some great complimentary petits fours with our espresso.   Certainly recommended. At least at the higher-end of the one star spectrum well worth the time to travel here and the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r403695810-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2015-10-30,Bryan C,"We booked this restaurant for lunch on a Thursday during our holiday to Cantabria. The restaurant was empty apart from us but it didn't feel like it. The staff were great with our dreadful Spanish and complete lack of understanding of Spanish cuisine. The place has a lovely balance of old and new.  So, the food. For starters my daughter (11) and I both had the cod salad which was basically raw cod, which had been 'cooked' in lemon juice. The eleven year old wolfed it down declaring it 'wonderful'. My if had a cocido or bean stew which had the most int nose flavour either of us had come across. For mains, my daughter had a poached hake dish which was perfectly cooked. My wife went for chicken with black rice, while I ordered what I had expected to be a beef stew of some kind, but turned out to be tripe and possibly lungs; it was gorgeous. The only reason all plates were not wiped clean was that the portions were very generous. For dessert we had a meille feuille, and two apple tarts.  The Wien list, as you would expect is extensive, but priced remarkably fairly. Strong representation from most Spanish regions including Mallorca which was a surprise as we haven't seen their wines outside the island before. We went for  hefty red from Toro, which I had been dying to try for ages. Prices are very reasonable as seems to be the case throughout Cantabria.  All in all a fabulous meal in lively surroundings. The dishes were traditional regional fare but given a twist or made special. This is a fantastic restaurant and we would like to thank the staff who took the time to explain things to us. Next time I'll pay more attention when they say 'tripe'. It wasn't a dish I would have chosen, but I'm very glad I had it because it was truly delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r323243778-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2015-08-29,David T,"""From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave this is one big enjoyable experience. I have eaten tasting menus before but the 'Experiencia' was unbelievable. Well thought out, well explained and just amazing to eat. Such a variation of tastes and quality presentation. Oh, and you will be comfortably full! The wine list is a wine lovers delight. We settled for one of the many Gran Reserva Riojas and was not disappointed. The mark ups are minimal too! The waiters were excellent. Very efficient and unobtrusive. They also spoke excellent English. Don't be afraid of taking children with you. They accommodated by producing a dish of less rich and daunting food that our 12 year old loved!!!, however, to her delight, the selection of children's pudding was from the a la carte menu and didn't disappoint. The atmosphere in some Michelin starred restaurants can be a little pretentious. Not here. You must give this well run establishment a try."".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5562707-d1752010-r304647063-Cenador_de_Amos-Villaverde_de_Pontones_Cantabria.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

We didn't have to worry about our poor Spanish as not only had the whole menu had been translated it also made perfect sense! The four of us chose the middle price tasting menu at €60. Individual changes are allowed if there are dislikes. A  selection of  appetisers came in succession, followed by a superbly fresh fish course, melt in the mouth oxtail as the main course, desert and a planchette of petit fours. The service was faultless - neither rushed nor slow. They have an incredible wine selection and we accepted their recommendation and had a terrific Rioja which was also sensibly priced. Absolutely faultless cooking, each mouthful was a joy to experience. Jesus Sanchez is a chef who shows great skill using local ingredients to ensure that all his dishes work well together.

2024-10-11,Carlos F,"I hadn’t been to Marbella bars for years and being from Santander I recognize that it made me evoke those feelings of places where chaos, haste, bad education and bland food reign.  A freshly captured anchovy quality pit sold as if it were the last liter of oil there will be in 100 years. An outdated service that can keep you waiting between dishes for more than 30 minutes. It is especially serious when they make one day after another the same menu for the whole world as chain of production of cocacola in Galdakano. Maybe some bartender slave had a cramp or the arrogance of service for saying we are local Santander produced an irreparable dislike. Feeling rejected in a 300 site for a beard is a feeling that cannot be explained. I think the priority should be to make yourself comfortable with the deal, not to accommodate the chair when you come back from the bathroom. It seemed that they had the strava installed by how they ran back and forth like headless chicken, chick stingers as they forced us to accept that they are called in Cantabria. I sincerely believe that the lack of the usual Mexican sommelier has produced a disintegration in the sanchineta. When he came to receive from us both ears the tail and the exit through the big door he refused to tell him that after 6 excellent times he was surprised with this drop in level only worried about the stab by tripavisor.

Other savoury dishes were: - Alaskan king crab  - Kinmedai (served in the kitchen where I’d the pleasure of meeting Chef Richard Ekkebus again)  - Pigeon   All of them were very delicious but the pigeon dish was by far the most impressive. The meat was of outstanding quality and cooked to perfection. It’s cooked medium rare but when I cut it there wasn’t any hint of blood. The small slice of flesh on top of the dish was very juicy and tender. Okinawa corn on the side was very sweet.   The 2 desserts weren’t bad.

The ambiance: The restaurant was re-decorated a few years ago and the new decoration looks much better than before. Newer style, very clean, the tables are very spacious. The restaurant was only half full last night so it was also very quiet. Everything on the table was clean and tidy, as it should be with a 2 Michelin star restaurant.  The staff: The staff is well trained, very amicable and willing to chat just the right amount. The dishes were explained very clearly and my wife (who is an excellent cook herself) was able to ask questions. Getting the attention of the staff was no issue.  Visit of the kitchen: With our Full Amber Experience came a visit of the kitchen. A nice touch that we appreciated, which I don't think too many restaurants in HK offer. Our Spanish Mackerel dish was prepared before our eyes by the chef with full explanation. We then had our dish in the kitchen while the chef was explaining to us how the whole kitchen is working. A totally cool experience.  The wine list: The wine list is extensive and comparable to Restaurant Petrus for example, and more extensive than Gaddis. The markups are a little on the high side compared to other fine dining restaurants in HK. I had chosen my wine in advance and went with a 2012 Malhadinha (a red Portuguese wine) that lived up to my expextations entirely. The glasses used by the sommelier were the correct ones.  The food: The menu is an absolute masterpiece. Each dish is extremely well crafted, the ingredients used of the highest quality. The flavours are very complex and goes along very well with the presentation of the dishes. 2 things to note: - the menus are entirely sustainably sourced and Amber gets a Green Star from Michelin for this. - there is a vegetarian menu option, which my daughter ordered, and the portions are meaningfully more copious than the non-vegetarian menu, similar to my previous experience at Amber. Not an issue of course, but worth noting.  Our Anniversary dinner was a complete success, and we'll definitely come back to Amber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r934542017-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2024-01-09,tobeslo,"My wife and I revisited Amber for a birthday lunch celebration after many years - the last time was some years back before its renovation.  We liked the softer ambiance and the natural light filled space.  The dishes were meticulously put together with taste profiles as precisely executed as we could remember. We chose the “Extended Amber Experience” with four courses and it was sumptuous and satisfying.  We were delighted by the prawn consommé which was flavoursome, the tooth fish and scallop with was tender with freshness, the duck that was so gamey, while the signature Red Sea Urchin “cauliflower” lobster caviar was as memorable as our last visit.  The petit four combo was one of the most impressive with fruits, and freshly made Ying Yang (coffee and tea) mix.  Staff were professional and attentive, who explained each dish clearly; and the wine list comprehensive and advice was spot on - the range of wine-by-the-glass is large.  We enjoyed the experience from start to finish, with each element working nicely together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d939504-r932985561-Amber-Hong_Kong.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

My friend and I booked a table for 2 in Amber for a special Four Hands Dinner of Amber x Syrco BASE in 13 Courses menu. I really enjoyed the new concept of Amber restaurant after the renovation.  (Amber's progressive menu showcases pure flavours, masterful techniques and chef Richard Ekkebus's creative vision. Taking a thoughtful approach to fine dining, the new menu dispenses with dairy products, minimises refined sugar and reduces salt. Diners appreciate the flavours in their purest form.)  Needless to say the guest chef Syrco created an amazing & interesting menu with the combination of Dutch & Indonesian flavours. My favourite dishes are the Pigeon Kobocha Foie Gras from Amber and the Grouper Turmeric Cabbage from Syrco BASE. Looking forward to the new restaurant Syrco BASE opening in Bali in Q4 2023.

Having tasted most of the (extensive and thoughtful) menu in April at the Trattoria in Sant'Agostino, I knew everyone was in for a treat, and they did not disappoint. Mattia was also extremely accommodating with respect to our requirements and helping us sort out the bar service. They drove two hours north for our event, and cooked in an outdoor gazebo. None of that affected the quality of the food or the service. Bravo. I will definitely re-visit the Trattoria on our next trip to Italy.

2024-09-17,GuillaumeTirel,"Stayed at the hotel and ate at the 3*-restaurant as well at le Cabro. Paradise one earth, any picture you take from any angle is postal-card like! I wish I had bought that house decades ago! Great wine list. Quite a large change in the cuisine from my last visit 24 months ago. I would make a special mention to a ""Corinne"" (?), a young lady from Maurice who looked after my table at  le Cabro and was only smile and kindness. That’s what we want in restaurants: we do go to eat and taste cuisine, true but in the end, the floor is what makes a meal a moment when you simply ingest food however good it can be or a moment that becomes a key souvenir you remember all your life. There are 3 key reasons why one eats at a restaurant: 1- don’t want to cook. 2- don’t know how to cook (and master some special techniques etc…). 3- don’t have access to some special ingredients ( a 90-days aged meat, some exotic herbs for ex). That’s besides wishing to celebrate an event (but you could do that elsewhere).  Most people can’t see the difference between a Bourguignon lobster and a Thermidor beef so the warmth, the attentive staff, the smile on the face of each staff member is what makes the difference between even very high-end restaurants I have visited over the years. A mechanical service is the last thing you want, you know the one where a young staff will mechanically recite a prepared text and where most -young- staff will be too stressed  to make a mistake  and forget to smile?  The other special mention is to be able to interact with owner Jean-Andre Charial. Professionals of his calibre are now sadly rare in this industry, made me think of M. Depee (Pere) as well  from another great Maison a few years ago…Opened on Sunday evening which is great as not much choice elsewhere as we all know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r970123576-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

Instead of enjoying a peaceful view of alpilles we had to deal with our neighbour feeding his lamb supplement to his dog, listen to crying babies and watching patrons wearing t-shirts and chains vape.  The senior servers are professional, the junior ones with different uniform were amateur for a 3* in France.

The food and the gimmicks were a bit disappointing. We did the 10 course tasting menu which was a lot of food. By the end I hated everything that came because I was very full. I would have preferred to have the option of five, seven and ten. The presentation of the food was truly interesting, very creative and very pretty, however I cannot say they  all tasted good. I think more effort was put into presentation versus taste. Again it is one of those three Michelin star restaurant that focuses more on presentation.

Each of the courses was a delight to vision and palate. We had after an appetizer of dots of flavor, two fish courses, one of squid and one of red mullet.

Here we were given no choice but a tasting menu of 8 or 10 courses. We saw evidence that choice existed (a gigot bone) but were assured that eating a la carte was not possible.

At the end of the dinner, the chefs come and see you, which is always a pleasure.  So what was not up to my expectations? Basically the value for money of the meal. It was all extremely good products, perfectly cooked but so much ""expected"", with so little imagination or fantasy. Lobster, lamb and pigeon are not mandatory if they bore the cook and the client. The sardines with their heads, this was original and unexpected. The desserts are normally a dream of inventiveness, here they are stuck in their tradition. The signature desserts of the house are what, 40 years old?   And tradition can kill a third star. It felt to me nearly the same I felt at Paul Bocuse just before it lost its third star, resting on its laurels, serving the same dishes as under President Giscard d'Estaing... I don't think the crêpe will live forever in my mind as Gilles Goujon's oeuf pourri à la truffe, as Bras's gargouillou de petits légumes, as Eric Fréchon's cannelonni. And this was my disappointment.  However, I'm sure the team has all the capacity to innovate, modernize and be a three-star restaurant worth of 2022.

2022-05-31,rjbreen,"This was our second stay at the hotel and dinner at the restaurant. Our first was in 2018 when it was a 2-star restaurant and we would have been back sooner had it not been for COVID.  This time was to celebrate our 35th anniversary.   I have often wondered what the difference was between a 2-star and 3-star and now I understand.  While the food was phenomenal both times, the service had clearly risen to a new level. I don’t understand how previous comments were so negative.  I don’t disbelieve them but it is certainly not the experience we had. We ordered the menu Ballade with the upper level of wine pairing so well over $500 euros per person. I can say that the experience was worth every penny.    Dining in such a restaurant is something anyone who is a foodie owes themselves at least once in their lifetime. It is not just the food which was exceptional.  It is the overall experience. The service was like a well oiled machine. The staff was ultra attentive and courteous. The wine pairings were perfect and we had a chance to experience some incredible wines that we otherwise may have never discovered.   If you are looking for a great meal with courteous staff, it is true you can get that in many France restaurants for much less  and we have done a lot of that each year when we spend a month in Provence.

We chose the Menu ""Ballade des Baux"" for the first evening - of the six courses, a starter of snails and garlic stood out, but the other dishes, except perhaps for the dessert, were excellent too. The second evening, we went à la carte - and the two starters of warm razor clams and roasted anchovies 'in sandwich style' as well as the pigeon and the Honey Millefeuille dessert were top. My wife and sister in law had the milk fed lamb and thought it as the best lamb they had ever eaten. This was served with an adaption of 'gratin dauphinois' which was probably a tad too heavy as a side dish - if there had been some suitable vegetables as a side, that might have been preferable. But this is nitpicking at a high level. The wine list of the Oustau is outstanding - rarely will you find such depth of prestige Burgundies and Bordeaux - what includes Lafleur, Petrus, Domaine de la Romanée Conti. The pricing of these wines is intriguing - some vintages of Romanée Conti wines or Chateau Lafleur are way below their retail price.... which is why we had put two bottles of DRC Vosne Romanée Duvault-Blochet and Echézeaux reserved before our arrival.... and what a treat that was, with memories for a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r816080949-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2021-10-14,mgjinich,"A 3 Michelin star restaurant cannot spare anything. They should realize one goes expecting the dinner of a lifetime. What a disappointment!

Can you imagine, in a three star Michelin restaurant? One had to look for the waiters and signal all the time to get their attention. They were never ready, even though there were too many running about. I complained to one of them about not having been served the water I requested and his answer, with a sardonic smile, ""c'est comme ça"". Unbelievable!

2021-10-11,Maria J,"The trouble when one expects the best dinner ever, is that just a simple mistake turns the event into a total rip off. And since we experienced several mistakes, the whole night was awful. The waiter did not wear his face mask properly, and kept touching it all the time before setting silverware on the table or serving food. The legs of lamb were cold and full of fat. The potatoes au gratin were cold as well. In other words, we could have spent much less money and enjoy a better dinner elsewhere. Avoid the pretentious attitude. Not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r814069180-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,1,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

We had an amazing time (do not understand previous comments on the service which was top notch) with very creative food which surprized us in very good way. We took à la Carte starting with seashelf knife and sardines, then had lobster in two services and sweatbread. Dessert was also amazing as they made a sorbet in fronf of you with ice cube. We took a bottle of Domaine du Chevalier Pessac Leogan from 1975 which was perfect.

2021-09-18,Womanatthebesttable,"This was a bad choice that cost well over 1000 Euros; we would suggest you not make the same error. And we will suggest to Michelin that the mere idea of having different bread-items served with various courses is an insufficient reason to have awarded this place an additional star when it is run as poorly as it is--they should not include it on their well-respected list. My husband and I  decided to treat our hosts to the full dinner for our group of friends, believing from our experiences in the past at the same venue three years ago, and then three years before that (when we were guests at the hotel) that we would enjoy festive and memorable dining occasion. Boy, were we WRONG. While I don't speak speak French terribly well, I understand it, and the nasty little comments made about us by the servers--in passing and in undertones--we the kind of snarky remarks you'd expect from 19-year-old diner waiters in Queens--but at least the waiters in Queens would be funny and charming. These servers were simply nasty and judgmental (""This man here,"" said, one, referring to my spouse, ""Knows absolutely nothing about the wine and yet he keeps asking me questions. You talk to him""--a remark, by the way, that had nothing to do with a language barrier). The dishes were indeed inventive and intriguing, if not all equally complex or enjoyable, but the poor service cast an unmistakable shadow over our evening. When we left, I commented on my disappointment to a man I presume was the manager--I was paying the bill and he was overseeing the transaction--and he expressed a small moue of disappointment. He then gave me two little cakes in two little boxes; an odd offering given the number of guests. Let's just say it didn't leave any of us with a better taste in our mouths about the dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r810564886-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,2,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2021-08-28,Musgo,"If there is a hotel where I always repeat even if I get angry every time I go, that is the Oustau de Baumaniere.  The location is wonderful, but the service gets worse every day.  There are exceptions, workers who have been there for years and try to make up for the shortcomings of the new ones.  For example, the maitre of the restaurant is magnificent, as are the older waiters and especially those who collect your suitcases and make transfers between the reception and the hotel, they are the best of the hotel.  The great loss has been the sommelier's retirement (Gilles Ozzello).His substitute I do not know if he was busy or hiding during our stay but he never attended us and those who did broke all the corks of the bottles ... The hotel has a magnificent wine cellar.  The waiters have a lot to learn from the maitre and what quality standards are in a Michelin star restaurant and in a Relais & Châteax hotel.  The Oustau de Baumaniere has the location, the restaurant, the wine cellar , but the young waiters fail .  Forgetting these deficiencies in service, the hotel has something magical",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1819081-d4453621-r806987758-L_Oustau_de_Baumaniere-Les_Baux_de_Provence_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cot.html,3,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks
2021-08-26,C J,"Does a 3 star chef have the right to fail? Yes certainly, but certain basic principles should be covered for a 250€ per person experience- no matter the stars ⭐️ attached : 1) A nice welcome & friendly front of house 2) Sommelier - knowledgeable if possible  3) An amuse-bouche ou au minimum bread & olive oil or some olives (sorry, every average Italian around the corner offers that …) 4) An Alternative if someone has diatery constraints for one dish of the menue 5) A chocolate or cookie with the coffee  6) A table decoration in August which doesn’t remind Christmas  🎄 in the 70th with a green shawl and the white candle-triple-set from Ikea (which you cannot light on as too much wind outside…)  So even if the chef has a bad day regarding the food like in our case, 1-6 could and should be assured.

2021-08-08,PenibleMaisJuste,"There is so much to say that I probably will remain very top-line, and only share an anecdote to spice up the review.  Yes, it's expensive, but as is NOT often the case with such multi-starred high-flying restaurants, it is totally worth it. The Ballade des Baux menu is incredible, the sequence of amuse-bouches and dishes is stunning, the seasoning and cooking levels are perfect, course after course after course. The service is spot-on, with the right mix of formalism and pragmaticism. The terrace is sublime. To top it off, there is a proper plateau de Fromages, which is a dying tradition in French restaurants... thanks for keeping this flame alive!  Now, the anecdote: The menu includes snails... I am a sucker for snails, which my grandparents used to ""hunt"" and cook when I was a kid, so I have a special link to them. My daughter and wife a bit less as it is such a polarizing product, even if you've never tried it before. They both requested that this dish got swapped for another course, the waiter came back to us and mentioned that the chef insisted that they try it, although another dish (zucchini flower in Tempura, iirc) would be served to them no matter what. The ladies went ahead, tried it and enjoyed it fully, hurray! The staff forgot the tempura in the meantime but I forgive them, as my wife and daughter have now climbed a major step in the French Gastronomy ladder, thanks to MM. Charial and Viel.

2017-07-22,Liana P,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with my mother and her friend and we were so thrilled with our experience. We had their Greek (left side) 6-course tasting menu with the Greek wine pairings - the meal started with an aperitif of 4 different small delicious treats and then a sundried strawberry and hazelnut amuse-bouche paired with a sparkling rose wine, moved onto a sea urchin dish, a choice of scallops or lobster (I had the lobster, which was served with the best mango/mint/other things I can't remember salad I've ever tasted), a cod dish (my favorite) which they served with their aged sourdough and homemade olive oil (definitely going home with a few bottles, you can't buy them online!!), an amazing lamb sous vide, a selection of Greek cheeses, and ending with a millefeuille and cherry sorbet. The dishes were consistently delicious, the presentation was beautiful, the wine pairings were 100% on point, and our server Zacharias was attentive and informative and made us feel comfortable and at home.  For anyone living in or visiting this area, I cannot sing my praises loudly enough for this restaurant. The ONLY critique I can offer is that the Margi does not promote this restaurant enough. Also, the restaurant is only open during the summer and only on weekdays, but it is still quite new (2 years old I believe) and my hope is that they will gain more well-deserved popularity and attract a broader clientele which may allow them to stay open during peak weekend hours. Their style of dining is not for everyone, but for the price and quality this should be a destination for couples and groups of adults looking for an exciting, sophisticated night out and a meal that is more art than food. I recently ate at L'Espadon at the Ritz in Paris (2 Michelin stars) and La Tour d'Argent (1 Michelin star) and while I am no food critic, the meal I had last night at Patio was a very close rival, if not better in some respects, and CERTAINLY better in terms of the price.  12/10 would dine here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562635-d10523457-r504375416-Patio-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,5,en,person_5_removed_line_breaks

2024-10-16,goldenerreiter,"I have been observing Mr Niederkofler’s cuisine for a while and during a holiday in South Tyrol, watching from afar became a haptic and culinary experience. The reception was appropriate for a top house and the start in the salon, with the amouse bouche, was also very successful. Afterwards there was a guided tour of the restaurant and in addition to the dining facilities, reference was also made to the company Moessmer, which owns the Villa. Our very charming companion during the evening, Alexandra, has delivered a perfect service with her colleagues and contributed greatly to the overall impression. The rooms are very dignified. On the one hand old building of an industrial villa, on the other hand top modern kitchen area with Chef Table. But the food was the real reason for the visit. We were already prepared because we already follow Mr Niederkofler, but also because we find ourselves in our attitude to food through the whole philosophy of Cook the Mountain. Umnes to anticipate: There were no weaknesses and was a perfect menu. My personal Unpacked were the farmer's toast from the greetings from the kitchen, the trout, the tartare from the Renke and the braised snails, which I attach as pictures.

The expectations for a 3 Michelin star are wow effect with every dish or as the Guide says “worth the trip”.  Definitely appreciable Cook the Mountain philosophy. There were highs (snails and Alpine grey meat) and some other dishes from which I would have expected more (risotto), a bit anonymous (salad). A note on the menu, and 'the first time I happen to see included in the list menu amuse-bouche and bread and butter, despite the latter undergoes an internal processing.

2024-07-22,Andrea C,"Michelin defines three-star holders as restaurants worth the trip. Given this assumption, it is not surprising if to get to the Atelier you cross a residential area and park the car near the Moessmer fabric factory. A quick and convenient move for those who, like us, were on holiday in Val Badia. Once you arrive at the Villa door you ring the bell and in Response, from the inside, three ""knock-knocks"" will be struck, before opening, as if to say that they want to ""enter our lives"". We are led into the garden for the aperitif and the journey is enhanced by the ""dance"" of the waiting staff who, perfectly coordinated, creates an imaginary corridor between us and our armchairs surrounded by flowers. Among the initial tastings stood out the tartlet with river shrimp mayonnaise and walnut strips, especially for the way these elements coexisted. Instead, I was puzzled by the piadina with ham, also to be tasted first, of a pig bred specifically for the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been better to serve it alone, so as to enhance it. Before we sat at the table, which in our case was the ""open"" kitchen counter, we were accompanied for a short tour of the Villa protected by the Fine Arts. The first course on the ""cook the mountain"" menu was a summer salad, consisting of 25/30 different vegetable elements, collected every morning with a ""foraging"" in the places near Brunico. Accompanied by seeds and other elements that made up the crispy part, it was seasoned with a sort of ""gazpacho"". A fragrant vegetable drink with notes of apple and mint was also poured into the glass and, apart, there were two buttery puff pastry breadsticks covered with dried herbs. One of the best dishes. Besides beautiful and plated in a ""surgical"" way. The second course, however, was the only little enjoyable. Mind you, perfect from all points of view, with the right freshness for the initial part of the tasting and also quite complicated. With double smoking, yoghurt or Kefir whey, berries, eggs and mustard seeds.  We're talking about smoked trout. We are now served excellent homemade bread with soft whipped butter, produced in small quantities by one of their suppliers and so good that it is not contaminated with other elements than a pinch of salt. Here is an extraordinary dish. A creamed risotto with goat cheese and garnished with nettles pesto, other goat cheese and mountain herbs. I would redefine it as the shepherd's risotto, because that fantastic cheese took me back in time, like Proust's madeleines or Remy's Ratatouille for the food critic. Also the cheese and nettles went well and the cooking was perfect. The fourth course, not to mention bread and amuse bouche, were snails, served on a bed of yoghurt or Kefir (I'm uncertain in relation to the trout and, anyway, I'm definitely doing something wrong), with crispbread, vegetables, bear garlic oil and, of course, other elements that I don't remember. Delicious, tender and tasty. The main course was a local ""Grigia"" beef, aged at least two months, whose cooking began, on a flaming grill, already at the beginning of the tasting, served with vegetable part in which exceptional chanterelles stood out and its cooking bottom. Apart from the tasty skewers made from scraps of various meats. A kind of meatball covered with nettles. Excellent conclusion, but, in fact, it did not end there. The desserts were also very welcome, starting with the pre dessert. An apricot ice cream/sorbet with aromatic herbs eggnog, served on a crispy crumble. And a sensational meringue. In the center a thick cream with an unmistakable flavor of milk or mountain cream, a fruit and jam brunoise. On the sides of meringues dusted with pollen, raspberry and other elements. At times it seemed to eat a cinnamon strudel, but, of course, cinnamon could not be there, not being a mountain ingredient. The philosophy of this cuisine is to use only alpine ingredients and to avoid waste. For example, meat and vegetable waste is used for bottoms, drinks and powders. If the preparation reads ""soy sauce"", it is actually a sauce, made with mountain ingredients reminiscent of soy sauce. Katsuobushi is made with smoked trout and not tuna, just as cinnamon is not cinnamon... Who knows what it will be? Maybe only salt is an exception. I imagine it is an expensive and tiring kitchen to pursue and so the bill, which for me was €757, can be better understood. To not exceed this figure I chose a bottle of Pas Dosè alto Atesino from 85 €, rather than the wine pairing or one of the extraordinary bottles that can be admired in the cellar in the basement. The bill is also better understood by relating it to the very high professionalism of the brigade and the waiting staff. The latter, similar to a single fluid body, composed of various units. Capable of changing its shape as needed. If, for example, I engaged a member of staff to chat with us about so many interesting things related to the world of chef Niederkofler, the others would change the coordination, perhaps just with a glance between them. This kind of service, I have already written in the past, I only found it in the three stars. Exceptional cuisine can be found in many places, but this level, a person who has not been lucky enough to be able to have lunch in a restaurant like this, can not know what it is. However, I noticed that the ""omakase"" formula of the open kitchen, which requires the staff to be behind us, does not promote that ""mind-reading"" feeling that I have perceived other times. In addition, the explanation of the dishes given by the chefs was much more complete than that given by the waiting staff. Coffee and the small pastry shop were served in another room. As a farewell gift we were given the menu signed by the chef and two Moessmer fabric coasters. Ultimately it was not just a lunch, but everything was conceived as a complete, peculiar and very satisfying experience. Peculiar, because it has its own well-defined characteristics, unlike any other place we have been. Yeah.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g194704-d26683048-r960669730-Atelier_Moessmer_Norbert_Niederkofler-Brunico_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2024-04-08,Alessandro P,"Among the 3-star experiences is that of the atelier moessmer was one of the most surprising. I won't deny that I was quite skeptical, given the recognition received after only a few months from the opening, which made one think more of a necessary act than a true appreciation of the cuisine... but as often happens, preconceptions are a penalizing limit. In the end the experience was fully satisfying and the recognition more than deserved. Already from the outside you can sense the value of the project, which is confirmed as unique in the rituals at the entrance and in the welcome in the aperitif room where we had the privilege of being guided through the spaces of the villa by the Chef, before being taken to the table. An experience obviously also dedicated to the other guests. Along the exploration we were able to appreciate the incredible work of recovering the spaces and the incredible open kitchen. The tasting was superlative, with a menu that scrupulously follows the doctrine of the territory, in a journey of flavors that represent tradition elevated by unique and incredible preparation techniques. We were then literally fascinated by the coordination and complicity of the dining room staff, impeccable in every way, who moved in synchronicity worthy of a ballet. Even the management, times and portions proved to be simply adequate for the experience.

If this were not the case there would be nothing beautiful, artistic, refined or aesthetic! I personally would just like the certainty that this is there and not a tested and pre-packaged mechanism. After this humble and personal general consideration of mine, in detail the house is very welcoming, perhaps the road to reach it is a little dark but it is a completely insignificant detail, the welcome is extremely professional, God forbid, but not taken for granted, the service in the youth room, polite and smiling, young and friendly sommelier. The menu satisfied us in terms of taste and presentation, perhaps I realize that the more you have experiences like this the more you have expectations, often senseless! It is always pleasant to have contact with the chef who in this case tells you the story, the choices and objectives, the projects, certainly following a script for each guest but it seems sincere and authentic.

The welcome is wonderful, in a lounge where you can drink a glass of champagne and taste the first delicacies of a dinner that will prove sublime. It takes us further to the table, for us a comfortable counter overlooking the kitchen, where throughout the evening we will see the painstaking work of a young team, who prepare the dishes with precision and attention as if they were working in an operating theatre.

Both raw and grilled oysters were amazing and the oyster tacos were out of this world! The only course we didn't love was the uni, which is typically one of my very favorite foods. Sadly this was the one item I felt was overworked, with the tomatoes outshining and overpowering the uni. That said, would go back in a heartbeat.

If you have a problem walking in the dark and feel unsafe about it, either do not visit this place in the winter months when sun goes down early in the afternoon or just avoid going to the restroom while you are there or just go during the day. I dared to go to the restroom by myself in the absolute dark, when I saw how dark it really was I came back and asked the waiter if they had any sensor lighting or if they could turn on some lights back there, he just said ""no we don't sorry"" so I proceeded to go back to my table and pick up my phone to help myself look after my steps using the phone's flashlight...Once I got to the restroom which is fairly far from the tables behind another part of the construction beside, there was a man inside the restroom next to me and I felt completely unsafe in that atmosphere...since it was so dark outside. Once I was trying to return with the same operation of turning my iphone lantern on, I started stepping in the gravel in the dark and that must have tipped off the dogs they have because I was surprised with the huge german shepherd they have unleashed on the property barking at me right beside me, which was very frightening considering the whole scene. ...Not a great end to the whole visit.

I am  a regular customer of the Brasserie (which is great and has in my view the best price to quality ratio in Luxembourg), and the second visit to the restaurant. My wife and I opted for the vegetarian menu. There are not many words to describe the food other than to say that it is a true revelation; compared to the earlier visit, I think it still has gone op a notch. The research that the Chef is putting into the local flora, the range of (local) herbs that he uses in his food, the complexity of flavors that he creates with vegetables and herbs only, and the extraordinary combinations are a testimony to the chef's talent and passion. My son had a smaller version of the menu (which does however feature the same dishes) - and I liked the fact that all of the amuse-bouche came for the 3 of us.  We really enjoyed this fantastic meal. I have been to many Michelin restaurants, most of them are great - with the focus on herbs and vegetables at this level, the Distillerie is however special - and in my view, one of the best vegetable based restaurants in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1006484-d1015502-r757532703-La_Distillerie-Bourglinster.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

All you can hear is other customers talking. its a chateau, they should have had a fireplace, or atleast curtains at the very least. all wuld have been forgiven but the meal was just bad, the central theme was smoke, the smokiness in some of the courses was actually the only good taste, we tried the veg and the non-veg course,  understandably the vegetables were seasonal and one would expect them to be tasty or interesting. It was neither, from a potato dish that had a lot of  raw potato pieces, to oven baked cabbage leaves, celery bits on cabbage, nothing tasted good. The dessset was the biggest let down, i left most of my dishes on the plate and the hostess would only smile and say hope it was ok, well I left most of it so ....

2020-02-23,Kathleen M,"Too many Michelin-starred properties with public chefs seem to have lost the one main ingredient necessary to any good meal...joy.  Joy in the cooking, joy in the serving and joy in the eating.  Tuju got the last two out of three correct...but with a center kitchen on full display, the first joy was blatantly missing.  Yes, food is important, and with a 12-course tasting dinner with paired wines, there are a lot of details that could possibly get missed, but kids, come on, it's food! Enjoy it!  Tabled in front of the finishing kitchen watching the 12 or so young professionals cooking and plating, I felt that I was witnessing a religious rite...all choreographed and all so, so serious.  To be fair, this appeared to be a reflection of Chef Ralston, who visited the kitchen several times to insure the creations were perfect...and they were.... seriously perfect.  Chef Ralston, and his executive chef Rhaiza, have created a beautiful and serene space in which to explore his seasonal take on Brazilian cuisine. And 'his take' is delicious, intriguing, sometimes challenging, and overall a delight; and one that I would love to revisit as the seasons change, however... My visit to Tuju was a highlight of a Pinheiros neighborhood food tour, unfortunately, it wasn’t the acme. And it could have been with just a hint of joy-in-the-doing emanating from the kitchen.

2019-09-26,Michael U,"Following the trail blazed by D.O.M., TUJU by Chef Ivan Ralston pushes modern Brazilian Cuisine forward by not specifically showcasing local Ingredients, but reinterpreting the world through Brazilian eyes inside his Restaurant at Rua Fradique Coutinho 1248.  Open since 2014, and recently the recipient of a second Michelin Star, it is after passing through a hushed hallway that guests find themselves inside Ralston’s “kitchen theater,” a staff fluent in English leading guests to polished wooden tables that extend back towards the bar and urban garden on the patio.  A quiet and focused space in Vila Madalena, everything from TUJU’s design to Cocktail list indicative of a Chef who has spent time researching both technique and his culture, guests visiting for the first time are encouraged to partake in Ivan’s “Season Menu,” the carte blanche taking into account allergies and dislike but otherwise consisting of thirteen courses served across two hours.  Trained in the kitchens of Maní, RyuGin and Mugaritz, the latter identifiable in modernist spins on local Produce, it was while sipping on a strong drink of Gin and sweetened Acid that course one arrived, sliced and aerated Pumpkin forming the background for Peas and Citrus with herbs that carry over nicely to a “Taco” comprised of sweet Crab and shaved Corn wrapped in Nasturtium.  Continuing light with translucent Shrimp swimming in vibrant Broth, its follow-up a comparison of local River Mussels to those from the Atlantic bathed in Manioc Root Juice, fans of Uni will be stunned by tender Tongues amidst a tangle of Leeks with Parsnip Cream while torched Cauliflower finds itself the centerpiece of a thick Sauce that tastes something like Mole mixed with Soy.  Shifting back to Seafood, a tender Tentacle obtained through Chef Ralston’s relationship with local fisherman accented in umami, one would be hard-pressed to name a more interesting *looking* dish than Arapaima Fish in Seaweed Pil Pil, the combination of snappy Flesh and Skin Crisps equally tantalizing alongside Artichokes and Bean Sprouts.  Completing savories with grilled Tuna and two types of Palm plus unsweetened Açaí, a diversity of textures seeing the best bites those that incorporate a little of each into a single forkful, it is by way of Cheese that the palate is transitioned, the Blue and Parmesan-mimic particularly impressive, as too was housemade Bread and Butter plus the bright green Fruit described as a Fig.   Not scaling back on sweets, Dessert number one perfuming stewed Berries with Mint in a makeshift Sundae, it was while Coffee dripped tableside that a tangy Yogurt Parfait dazzled, the Pour Over subsequently enjoyed with housemade Chocolates filled with everything from Dulce de Leche and Cashew Fruit to Garlic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r713116135-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2019-02-17,Viajante_SP,"It is not by chance that Tuju is top ranked by Trip Advisor users .   We have ordered the smallest tasting menu , which was creative and tasteful .   Lamb and fish were part of the sequence . Both were well prepared .  The carta of wines should be bigger to match such a good meals.   Brazilian ingredients reminded me another good restaurant : DOM and the Chef Atala.   High level service provided by waitress and maitre. Sommelier was not so confortable to speak in English ( I took a friend of mine from France to have a dinner at Tuju ).   Based on Brazilian standards and taking into account the order was the smallest menu and only two glasses of wine, the final price might be considered high. On the other hand, this level of restaurant would be charged in a similar level abroad.

2018-12-15,CaliGirlSAS,"My husband and I had the pleasure of experiencing the phenomenal culinary journey of the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairing and we were blown away.  Don’t listen to any reviews that say that there is no soul or flavor in the food. It’s quite the opposite - we felt that the complexity of the depth and layers of flavor was perfectly executed and also appropriately balanced for each course from start to finish. We each experienced varying levels of umami moments throughout the evening and enjoyed the uniquely Brazilian ingredients that we would never get to experience anywhere else.   The portions were well thought out.  I’ll have to admit that we were a bit intimidated with the idea of 12 courses but by the end we didn’t feel too full or heavy - just happily satisfied.   I’ll also note that I’m vegan and my husband doesn’t eat pork. They had no problem accommodating our dietary restrictions. We also had the privilege of speaking with Chef Ivan Ralston towards the end of our meal - he was such a lovely presence and it was clear from our discussion that he’s in pursuit of excellence and innovation through his craft.   We’ve eaten at Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and have sometimes been disappointed with some restaurants’ tasting menus given that one or more courses may end up being bland or weaker than the others. That was not the case here - each course was impressive. That’s quite a feat for 12 courses!  For all of the reasons noted above, we feel that this place deserves 3 stars instead of 2!  We hope to come back here again. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to dine here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r639715964-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2018-06-07,Xicorea,"We went for our anniversary dinner to Tuju last evening and had their five-course Farmers’ Market tasting menu. We felt it did not live up to our expectations from many perspectives.  First I would like to point out what we did like. Being light drinkers, we usually have just one glass of wine each. At Tuju, the by-the-glass offerings were outstanding, among the best I have seen in Brazil. Our server was also very intent on making sure we enjoyed the experience, going so far as offering a (very good) chocolate tasting to my chocolatolic wife, free of charge. Finally, we loved the dessert.  The first thing that bothered us was their timing. Shortly after we ordered the meal, the server brought us some butter, olive oil, and salt – but no bread. We waited and waited. Some 10 minutes later, the bread arrived. They claimed that it took so long because it was being warmed up. Yet we have been to many other places that serve warm bread without such delay.  We have been to a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Brazil and abroad, many I have reviewed on TA. Something we always enjoyed at such establishments was being surprised by the unusual flavors, textures, and looks. Tuju mostly failed at this.   Our first course was a broccoli-based appetizer (Broccoli in miso marinade, cauliflower, and walnuts). It had a fancy name and description and the texture was interesting. But the taste was rather bland.  They were out of the second course, white clam. We opted then for octopus (my wife) and a couscous (myself). My wife enjoyed the tender texture of the octopus, but was unimpressed with the rest. I felt my couscous was nothing special as well.  The first main dish was a fish coated with its own roasted and ground scales, rather good. It was well prepared, delicate and very enjoyable.  The second main dish was a wagyu beef rib, with manioc flour and bacon bits. We were both unimpressed, unfortunately.  The dessert was called a corn-meal brioche, but in fact it was pain perdu, and a very good one at that. It came with salt caramel and peanut ice-cream. It was by far the best course.  In spite of the friendliness and proactivity of our server, we felt that overall service lacked the professionalism and confidence a place of this caliber requires.  The overall impression we had was that in spite of the elaborate descriptions and well-designed settings, the dishes fell short of our expectations. We asked ourselves how Tuju could have been rated a two-star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r585854760-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,3,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2018-03-08,gibbyone,"The food at Tuju was fantastic and definitely the highlight of our trip. We did the 12-course tasting and each course was beautifully presented. Every bite danced on your pallette. Ingredients were fresh. Unique flavors were expertly combined to compliment each other. Some of the highlights were: the frozen infused watermelon cubes with cucumber and buttermilk, manioc tortilla with smoked beets, crunchy chicken and the lychee with thyme cream was out of this world. Staff was attentive and knowledable and capable of describing dishes and wine in English. The seating and lighting could be improved for more ambience -- the seating was a little stiff and the lighting was a little too bright. Cocktails were also excellent, but the wait for them was a bit longer than it should have been. Pricing was typical for a tasting of this size and caliber. I was also impressed that they offered a shorter tasting menu should you choose not to go all in. Eating is a wonderful way to discover a city and Tuju helped give Sao Paulo five stars. I would put this place on your must-do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303631-d6958658-r565284199-Tuju-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks
2018-03-03,Ericapm25,"We usually have “girl’s day out” at a nice place to celebrate our friendship and all.  We picked this place because it seemed really nice.   It is nice but sooo overpriced for the ingredients. I cook ( not even close to a chef, just making a point about ingredients, complexity etc) and I felt the menu lacked the “wow” effect.   Most of us chose the 12 course tasting menu. One couse was split pea soup. Come on!!!!   The drinks were good, We were impressed by the mixology. Desset was ok.  The cachaça ice cream was really really good. But 400 for  just one good dessert and a good drink is too much in my opinion.  I recommend  going for the experience. Go with friends to enjoy, visit the vegetable and herb garden they hold on the top floor.

2021-12-15,pushing p,"We were hugely disappointed with our experience here.   The restaurant is on a busy street with no signs for parking and no direct signage where to enter.  When we entered the restaurant there was loud banging from the open kitchen. Chef Anthony was banging something in a large pan then several of the other staff took their turns. The waiters were all dressed in chef whites while Chef Anthony wore a t-shirt and baseball cap.  The restaurant was not busy. The waiters were nervously busy, walking back and forth. It was very distracting. After Chef Anthony left they seemed to calm down without their nervous energy.   I ordered the vegan menu. My husband ordered a non-vegan menu.   The waitstaff was cordial however we waited a good 15 minutes before being asked if we would like an apéritif. We were served an amuse bouche. Mine was some sort of plant-based sushi. The rice was like concrete and it looked like a child made it. Not a good first impression of the food. Up to that point the wine menu had not been presented and my husband asked to see it.   My husband ordered wine and the bottle delivered did not match the description on the menu. We signaled to one of the waiters and he apologized, agreeing with my husband that the wine served was incorrect. The bartender (sommelier??) came immediately and loudly berated my husband for being wrong. Thank goodness for the Vivino wine app because my husband was able to show the bartender the wine label that should have corresponded with the wine menu. The bartender still argued, so loudly that the diners beside us stopped eating to see what was going on. My husband is very patient and quiet - he did not argue but let the incident go. Afterwards the bartender came again, making his point once more about the wine served was indeed the wine on the menu but the only label was incorrect. If a wine menu states that it is a certain wine, then that is what should be served, not an arbitrary one. Nor should the customer be loudly berated for the restaurant’s error. The wine incident was very stressful.  The food was not delicious. Some of the plates looked very nice but they lacked any flavor and seasoning. Hardly what’s expected in a Michelin star restaurant.  Since my seat was facing the kitchen I had a bird’s eye view of all the busyness. I saw a small styrofoam box on the floor. I didn’t give it a second thought until shortly after. The waiter put that same styrofoam box directly on our table (after being on the floor) to prepare a dry ice sorbet. I was shocked it went from the floor to our table. The sorbet had a showy presentation but had zero flavor.   My main course was some sort of architectural stack that fell over when the waiter put it in front of me. He tried to correct it with his long tweezers but was unsuccessful. He then used his bare fingers to correct the presentation. It should have immediately been taken back to the kitchen. This is the same waiter that plunked the styrofoam box from floor to table. That’s when we decided to leave.   We did not finish the rest of the courses because the experience had been such a disaster. The waiters looked visibly shocked and gathered to have “meeting” about our bill.  They reduced my husband’s portion while charging me the full price. They also did not charge us for the wine problem and neither did they apologize.   Before we paid, I went to the ladies room. The door handle to the stall came off and I couldn’t get out. The bathrooms have dark walls and low lighting and I could not see to reattach the handle. My phone was at the table so calling was not an option. After 15 minutes was able to wiggle the mechanism to open the door. Since the handle would not reattach, I took it to one of the waiters and he never blinked an eye for the inconvenience. I’m not making this up - the photo is below.   We will never go back to the restaurant. Even if it was inexpensive (which it wasn’t), in addition to all the faux pas, the food had no flavor and the service was not on par to any Michelin restaurants we have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g230063-d8065598-r822091830-Anthony_s_Kitchen-Meerbusch_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,1,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

His communication was easy going and combined with lots of laughter from us and himself. The whole atmosphere was gorgeous. Next to the fact that we all learned a lot about cooking in general and especially about our self prepared dinner we had so much fun. Anthony is an intelligent, charming and very knowledgeable person who can transmit the difficulties of cooking in a super easy way. The food: We were breathless when staring to eat our self made dinner.

Especially the new round tables open up completely new possibilities for how to sit and communicate with each other. They not only promote togetherness, but also exchange, which is particularly important in many cultures, such as West Africa, where people traditionally eat in circles. Anthony has shown an impressive touch here.  The West African-inspired star cuisine is in a nutshell! Even diehard gourmets can look forward to a whole new taste experience. The team is absolutely attentive and courteous – the chefs responsible for the respective courses come personally to the table to answer any question, no matter how small.

2021-12-15,SeanSky,"In Nuremberg on business and decided to go all-in for the best possible dinner experience.  If you have dined somewhere like Alinea (Chicago, IL), you know what fine dining can be -- Essigbraetien has earned its stars and deserves three!  From the moment you enter, you are treated as the only guests.  Trust the front of house and the kitchen staff to leave you feeling ""blown away"".  If you are an enophile, definitely include the wine pairing - selections from their cellar are perfectly matched with each course - and you will not find these wines in a retail store.  Very intimate setting but still appropriate for a business dinner for two.  Worth every euro and every moment spent dining with this team!  Frankly, this restaurant is the one reason to travel to Germany!  To the restaurant - please forgive that my review is in English.  But, language was no barrier to an amazing evening.

Many of the dishes are vegetarian, but they are just as delicious as the meat dishes. There was also an optional wine pairing for each course if you wish.

The wines were also high calibre and interesting.  Each course, the five main ones and the many tasters in between were all very different multi layer flavour sensations.

While there are a couple meat  dishes, out of the seven courses, all was very enjoyable. My son (teenager) is not a fan of vegetables, but loved every vegetable dish. If you’re looking for meat in every dish, based on the one night we dined here, this might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a diverse meal this should be a must. Don’t expect inexpensive if you’re eating at a Michelin starred restaurant, expect quality.  That’s what you’ll receive here, quality. My family & I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday dinner here!

Ex) Whenever foods came out, chef examine the foods individually and sommelier recommended wines(we didn't take a wine).  However unfortunately, it had no air-conditioner. through the opened windows, some bees and flies irritated us to take dinner. and we dont like vegetable, so we didn't taste the food. just enjoy seeing the wonderful foods. meat was just one in all food and the price is a little high to us.  consequently, I recommend this restaurant to vegetarians and those who wanna take special and newly taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r607425490-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,3,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks
2018-07-09,iloveeshly,"We dine for the past 10 years all over the world in the best restaurant as part of our job to cater to our high class clients. I personally adore vegetables and bland food. My partner is a vegetarian. We both eat tiny portions, but I felt like I've been given literally one slice of leek over the whole evening. Luckily I went for the 7 course menu that included a hip of lamb, so I wasn't going home completely starved as my girlfriend did who went for the 4 course meal instead. I wasn't asked how I like the meat, it was bloody medium rare. It was tender but nothing spectacular. Just a good piece of lamb, chewy tho and hard to cut without a steak knife. It was still the highlight of my dinner that gave me some filling satisfaction. We both love healthy, regional organic food- but the price is just ridiculously high for what it is-  Poor people food (leeks, celery, onion)  Delicious, but for that price I'm expecting lobster, Beluga Caviar,  Wagyu Beef and Champagne. We payed 400 Dollar for 2, only had 2 regional glasses of wine and came home hungry. Yes, the dishes were super cute presented in extremely tiny portions and beautifully arranged but nothing spectacular out of this world that's new or not seen before.  The windows were open the whole evening, attracting lots of flies into the glasses of water and wine. Maybe a net over the open window would be useful. We give the one star for the excellent service, that was really spectacular. You can tell the servants are highly trained and skilled. The door was held open, the napkin was replaced when falling on the floor immediately and the staff spoke perfect English. It was also great to see the chef comming to the tables. We only give one star in total because the price in comparison to what is offered is really not appropriate. Complimentary choclate chunks are given at the end which is really nice, but now I feel a bit sick eating all of them because of the hunger, smaller choclate would match the tiny menu. A note about holding a conversation down in this small formal room would be good with the mostly American visitors that evening talking  so loudly we knew all about their private business at the end of the evening. My partner is American and felt offended by their loud conversations. We missed some kind of gentle music. Unfortunately live music in not cherished anywhere when it gives such a great atmosphere. We expected to be blown away but we are quite surprised of what people think is unique and out of this world.....To us it's everyday healthy food that should be served in bigger portion for cheaper. We would be eating there daily. But with literally one leek on the plate you can't go home satisfied. We haven't regret going there tho, we had a great evening. We would not go back. Thank you for the great attentive and professional table service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r594762405-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,1,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks
2018-06-25,Brian Randall,"Having dined in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years, this year our visit was to Nuremberg and consequently Essigbratlein. Possibly rather more quaint than other starred restaurants we had visited, from ringing the bell to enter to the internal décor. As one would expect, service was impeccable but pleasantly jovial. Now for the difference, that lies in the unusual style of food, from the many amuse bouches to the clever and possibly unique use of vegetables. The menu I shall be posting with this review has lost a great deal in translation and is over simplified beyond belief. As always, we chose to drink the paired wines and had the privilege of tasting some superb well matched wines with our unusual meal. Overall, it was a very pleasant meal in a quaint restaurant, but would we go again, probably not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187310-d958191-r590502512-Essigbratlein-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,4,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

I have been to countless 2 and 3 star restaurants, but I keep coming back to Essigbrätlein and Etxebarri because they continue to impress me every time.  For me the best places are about brilliant ideas, talent, simplicity, hard work, honesty, service and fair prices. Essigbrätlein excels on every front - and several months later I still remember exactly how some dishes tasted.   In particular the ""cucumber and tomato"" dish stands out. I don't know how it's possible to take so simple ingredients and turn them into such an amazing experience. But Essingbrätlein knows and I can't recommend this place enough.

2024-09-26,mokstarr7,"I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.  First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.  Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.  Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.  I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses. This is yet another example of how service is lacking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r971450381-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,3,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

Anyone wonders how a deep fried slice of ""algae"" could be made to look like a half-piece of an oyster shell (with much imagination) and possibly taste like one (we failed...) should make an effort to dine here.

2023-08-17,AnGr2013,"We had dinner here. My wife and I eat at Michelin restaurants occasionally and were really looking forward to this. Our table was at the ground level of the hotel, felt like a dark hotel lobby with simple furniture. We were placed at a table for four which made me feel the whole evening as if two guests were missing at our table. If I book for two, I want to sit at a table for two.  For the entire dinner experience the dull elevator music was in an endless loop and the presentation of the food was the same. Every dish in a large plate with a tiny, tiny dish in the middle, all dishes accompanied by some extra sauce poured or crunch that was served with a lot of tamtam.   All dishes came with unbelievably elaborate explanations, at some point I felt tempted to tell the waiters that I just want to eat my food and not listen to them. The portions were miniscule even for three star Michelin standards.  The more explanations a dish needs, the less I trust it. Good food needs to speak for itself.      The desserts should be the grand finale, when the kitchen pulls out all the stops to bring the meal to a grandiose  ending. Far away from that in our experience.   Last but not least the wine menu: I find my way around any wine menu and dont need the help of the sommelier. But the Rutz wine menu doesnt even tell me if the wine is white or red (for appellations that produce both) I felt almost embarrassed to ask the sommelier.  And when the bill came and I saw I was charged EUR 32 for a 0.1l glass of champagne, I left the place angry and will not return.

2023-06-16,Xierwan,"We were eager to try the restaurant, as we had many good surprises with German chefs who had emigrated to countries other than Germany. Indeed, the country seems to have taken the same direction as its northern European neighbours for several years, with on the one hand a modern and inventive cuisine and on the other a completely revisited traditional cuisine.  The restaurant itself is superb, as well as the terrace, on which we were seated. The wines and food were all extraordinary without exception, as they should be in any establishment of this range (and with these high prices, it must be said).  The service is smooth, professional but also very relaxed, just like in any Scandinavian restaurant and also as nice and friendly as are the inhabitants of Berlin. Special thanks to the sommelier for his excellent advices and to the waiter who gives a casual thumbs up to signify that he is happy with our praise of the food.  This was a great experience for us, but I would perhaps not recommend it to people who think high gastronomy should always be buttoned up to the neck with old fashioned and stiff waiters in suit.

2023-06-07,MartinTafft,"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  We had high hopes and expectations from the reputation and the three Michelin star badge.  We regularly visit good restaurants when we are on our travels at home and in Europe.    We chose to have the eight course menu with the accompanying wine flight.  Things started pretty well with two or three really tasty and enjoyable amuse-bouche dishes.  Unfortunately, as the meal progressed we found ourselves increasingly disappointed by the standard of some of the dishes.  We also had a very distinct feeling that a number of the dishes were just far too oily.   Normally, the selected wines that accompany each course have the function of enhancing and complementing the flavours of the dishes, however, it felt as though they had been selected to try to combat the oiliness of the dishes.  Before we came to the end of the meal, we both were beginning to feel the slightly ill effects of the greasy nature of the meal.  When I compare this experience with many other recent experiences of less well acclaimed restaurants, and some other one and two star restaurants, I found it both disappointing from a culinary and flavour experience and also poor value for money.  It was, to my mind, extremely expensive for what it was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d718320-r893924466-Rutz_Restaurant_Weinbar-Berlin.html,3,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

We absolutely loved this dinner - it was one of the best we've had in a long time, and we've eaten at numerous 3* Michelin restaurants all around the world. They are thoughtful about the flavor of each dish and how it all comes together, without being pretentious. We especially loved the carp, the Mangalitsa pork, the nonalcoholic juice pairings, and the local German wines. They take humble ingredients and make them magical via alchemy - every dish was spectacular in its flavor, and the portion sizes perfect - we were full without the overfull, bloated feeling at the end of the meal. We loved the local German elements they incorporated into the meal - most of the ingredients are from local farmers and producers, although they are not fanatical about this and the emphasis really is on quality and making the meal fantastic. Service was great - very friendly and thoughtful without being intrusive in any way.

2022-10-08,Noa Aue,"The beauty of deception, pretending to be something that you’re not, lies in the element of surprise. The villain turns out to be the hero, the enemy to be a friend, and the fish to be a mushroom. Horváth jumps into the deep ocean waters of pretending, pushing the notions of what is and what is not from your eye, through your nose, and into your mouth.   A game of deception is as old and basic as we are. It goes back to childhood memories of Hide & Seek, Halloween parties filled with dress-ups, and your mum telling you it’s just an incessant piece of chuckled when it’s actually medicine. When we set down and had the first two dishes, everything was exactly where it should have been, with no deception. The wine was carefully chosen, the oyster mushroom false liver (foie gras) was spectacular, and the bread was simply on point. What can go wrong from here?   Do you know this art exhibition that doesn’t make sense no matter how many philosophical abstractions you make? That one friend that keeps arguing and arguing and takes it a bit too far to the point of incoherency? That techno track that should have just ended on minute 7:37? That’s your food experience at Horvath. A culinary attempt that fails on its own premises. You see, when things pretend to be something else, when food and dishes try to musk themselves and create a whole new experience, there are two options: they are either exceptionally interesting and mind-blowing or fall under their own weight into a bland, unsatisfactory mash of mushrooms.   No matter how many abstractions we will make, how post-modern we may be, a cucumber can not be a Sirloin, and a carrot is just a carrot.   In the end, Horváth fails. The food leaves you empty, unsatisfied, and mainly wondering what if: what if the chef tried to make actual food, and not abstractions of food concepts?  A word must be written about the Chocolate Sorbet 'Hunter Style': I've never had such a catastrophic dessert in a fine dining restaurant. Never.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1182072-r863649972-Restaurant_Horvath-Berlin.html,2,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2023-04-01,chloe k,"Creatively delicious experience. 6 course menu which is tailored and as a vegetarian I have never been treated as well in a fancy restaurant. They had to create a course for me because they had planned a celery ravioli with wakame and I’m allergic to seaweed … It was green asparagus - one of my great favourite vegetables!  Everything was beautiful from the truffle potato mash mise en bouche to the mushroom gnocchi, the leaks in a mustard seed mousseline with some citrus (yuzu?) to the two asparagus feasts, an incredible mingling of some lemony light coulis and on the other side some kind of tawny marmalade gravy.  The cheese course was also light and fantastic : a fromage frais quenelle (mini)  As was the pudding with a secret “orange sanguine” sorbet touch at the core. Also loved the mignardises- amazing pate de fruit (not sweet) and chocolate with a ganache and of course, the two bouchées d’accueil- one with caramelized onion and the other puffed rice as a base for a creamy dollop with an Iranian spice.  Everything is delicate, and yet extremely tasty and you can discriminate each main ingredient, nothing is drowned nor forgotten but underlined or highlighted depending on the intention.  It is a variation on the range of acidity and the textures that envelop it.  Even the zataar bread was to die for. (As was the pain de campagne)  Very creative, an enchanted journey in a lofty atmosphere neither dark nor bright.  A wonderful gift for the eyes and … especially the taste buds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r884363608-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2022-10-20,VBAMaster,"Based on a friend’s recommendation we were really looking forward to this meal. We got the 5 course with wine tasting. A few of the dishes were good, some like the snails with a spinach sauce not to our taste at all. But there were 2 major problems   1 where’s the protein?  At the end of the meal I lifted my spoon and said to my wife, do you realize we ate every dish with a spoon.  No fork or knife needed for what was served and nothing other than the small bits of snail, which have no taste on there own. There was absolutely no substance to the meal and at this price you expect more. I think they know that as the bread kept coming so we weren’t hungry when we left.  The wine pours were tiny, really 1 or 2 small sips. Smallest I’ve had on a tasting menu.

2022-10-08,Oaklandish3,"I admired the creativity of the meal, the freshness and delicacy as well. However, we ate the five course meal and had to eat several bread rolls to feel full. I am not a big eater either. The meal was light to a fault, with almost no protein. The wine pairings were not particularly interesting and were such small pours we couldn’t really even enjoy the wines deeply enough as they were gone in 3 or 4 sips.  Since they do change the menu regularly, other diners might have a completely different experience. We definitely saw the effort and thought that went into each dish. We enjoyed four of the five courses, and found the snail dish not good due to the very bitter and tough herbs used to make the sauce.  The creative cheese course was perhaps my favorite course of the night.  My husband would give us a much lower than a four score but I really did appreciate the effort put into the dishes but….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d17448877-r863713383-Anona-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,4,en,person_3_removed_line_breaks

2022-08-24,Wen,"The reason I wanted to eat here was because they have a focus on sustainability and I really wanted to learn more about how they implement that, to how they select their ingredients and where they source them from etc, and we were told that it would be explained to us later, but it never happened? I think it’s especially important for a fine dine restaurant to be elaborate on this part, so I found that incredibly disappointing first of all. The service from the waiter was very smooth, and I do appreciate that. However whenever dishes were served to us I felt like it was so rushed in a way. The chef himself would describe it at a very swift pace as if he's in a rush and then he'd leave in a blink of an eye. I found that a pity because it felt a bit careless in that aspect. Another thing that's a minus was when I explicitly said I'm allergic to cherries, they ended up serving me a dish with cherries in it anyway by mistake. They did kindly replace that with another dish with green beans and lemon jelly though and that was really good. But I still find it a bit messy on their part. The dishes themselves were good, but I wouldn't say they were super innovative. There was also an escargot dish that I didn't quite like, but I think escargot just isn't my thing. I had some feedback on the sauce that was accompanied with it and the chef listened but then brushed it off, I didn't really feel like it was appreciated. I did thoroughly enjoy the rest of the courses though, especially the 3rd, 4th (the green bean lemon jelly one) and the first dessert. Those were my favs! I still think it's a good restaurant, but I feel like the personal attention part is lacking, as I explained earlier.

2021-08-20,MicheleParis,"I took a very good friend of mine last week for dinner for her birthday (Aug. 12). For dinner is only  a discovery menu in 5 courses for €75 (€120 including wine pairing), and a tasting menu in 7 courses for €95 (€155 including wine pairing). For lunch you have ""à la carte"". We opted for the 7 courses without wine pairing. It was indeed a lovely discovery. Thibaut Spiwack is the Chef and his philosophy is: local and seasonal products, waste reduction, minimal use of water and electricity, We started with a wonderful combination of tomatoes followed by an excellent mixt of Normandy beef and Southwestern duck with red fruit pickles. Then we had  amazing snails from Poitou, with its cream of herbs... it was so light! They served us after  tuna from the Bay of Biscay, marinated and grilled tataki style with Paimpol coco beans. The highlight then was the cheese with a foam and some red fruits. The first desert was a wonderful peach tart with a delicious sorbet of peaches of the grapevine. We also had a second dessert with caramel, peanuts (not really my favorite one). We loved the decoration and the blue colors of the dining room. Service is attentive and professional.  We loved the cuisine of Thibaut Spiwack.

A dinner that ends with an unimaginative tzatziki: cucumber and Greek yogurt. And finally, never seen in a starry: you have to pay 20€ more because you don’t eat pigs!

2020-01-18,DvA,"Andreas Caminada is Switzerland's most famous chef, so of course we had heard a lot about his restaurant before we finally made it up to a remote little village in Grison for an extended lunch at Schloss Schauenstein. It turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We were overwhelmed by the quality and the creativeness of the food, even before we got to the first main course. Caminada starts his menu with plenty of outstanding amuse bouches and appetisers before serving several larger courses. He refrains from using posh ingredients like caviar, wagyu beef or foie gras. Instead, all the dishes are inspired by local produce and recipes. Nevertheless, the combinations of flavours are just heavenly. And on top of it, each plate looks like a wonderful piece of art. The cheese course is another highlight: next to an exclusive selection of Swiss and French cheese, a broad range of side dishes makes for an unmatched variety of exciting flavours to finish off the savoury part of the meal. Of course, there are several sweet courses too. The best of which, in our case, was an extremely fluffy and delicate milk soufflé. The staff is young, and maybe a bit insecure, but this hardly harms the overall experience. At the end of the visit, coffee, digestives and petit fours are served in an upstairs room of the ancient chateau.

The food was top notch, alltough i must say that if i only had to judge the food without the surroundings like service, ambiance, location, etc, i would feel that it was a tad overpriced as i had comparable/equal quality menus for a lot less.   Nevertheless, we got to meet and chat with the chef, an amazing and very charismatic person, which even had his sous-chef give us a tour of the kitchen.   Overall it was outstanding & deserves it's reputation as best restaurant of Switzerland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r739046047-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2020-01-09,Joe_Black72,"I know... I promised in my past reviews I wouldn't have visited any more 3 Michelin star restaurants... But I did it again.   And result was the same.  3 Michelin stars -and Michelin star rates restaurants in general- are the most impersonal restaurants I know. No character,  no passion,  it seems they cook to get 3 stars.  In the old days instead,  you got 3 stars because you cooked.  Anyway....   Amazing location in one of the best cantons of Switzerland. Very nice atmosphere and very private dining rooms.  Chef Caminada may be a great food engineer,  no doubt about that,  but what he is totally missing in my view is the connection to the territory.   We are in a Canton full of great mountains... So why the hell do I need to feel Asian influence in my plates?  I wanna fell the mountains and its smell.  If I want to feel Asian I would go to an Asian restaurant!   The endless pre entrees tastings were just too much.  And, again,  this is a new fashion -probably requested by Michelin so that you can get stars-,  which never existed in the older days where the heavyweight was food and not its design.   I can't tenner any main dish I would order again.  But for sure I thought twice I was somewhere between Vietnam and Cambodia,  and not in fantastic Graubuenden.   Sweets were not amazing at all,  although perfect from the outside.   Wine list honestly disappointing. Even more disappointing was that I asked something to the Sommelier and he couldn't answer -and me,  I'm not a professor at all...  I just know a few things about wines!.   Even more disappointing was the cheese dish.  I asked only one thing to the cheese dish waiter and,  again,  he couldn't answer.  And my question was SO basic!  I couldn't believe it.   These 2 people,  with all due respect,  shouldn't be working at a 3 stars restaurant!  This shows exactly today's attitude.  Great plates,  great designs,  amazing engineering in the food...  And no substance behind that. No passion.  No heart.    As much as I like you,  dear chef Caminada, you won't see me back unless you so profound changes to your kitchen...  You may loose some stars if you do that,  but you may make many more clients happy and become special also without stars.

Service is exceptional.  The wine pairing was terrible. The sparkling wine and white burgandy were lovely. The local wines were awful. I appreciate the vision of supporting local vineyards, but with this level of food, you need world class wines!   Order a bottle instead!

2019-10-05,Yuan Y,"Schloss Schauenstein is an institution in Switzerland: most people have to book (and maybe even save) several months in advance, many come to celebrate a special occasion, and most people who dine here probably also regularly visit other fine dining establishments... so the expectations are very high.  We came for lunch - which is what we would recommend, as the entire meal lasted 5.5 hours, and we didn't eat for 16 hours afterwards. We've ordered the 6 courses meal, and my friend also ordered the wine pairing. As expected, the food was world class. Andrea Caminada, clearly, is a culinary artist. Excellent produce, stunning presentation, beautiful flavors. We especially loved the langoustine which was one of the best dishes I have eaten in my life. You get a huge selection of snacks and amuse-bouches before the starters, and I loved the small booklet to take home which included our menu as well as some seeds to plant at home.   When you dine in a restaurant like Schloss Schauenstein, the service needs to be on a par with the food as it shapes your entire experience... you might not remember most of the dishes that you ate, but you will always remember how you felt when you were at the restaurant. In this regard, unfortunately, our expectations were not met.   - The restaurant offers a free pick-up from Thusis which is very nice. We were warmly welcomed by a cheerful young lady who knew our names and immediately made us feel like we were old friends.   - Schloss Schauenstein is a beautiful little castle, and all the surroundings are also very charming. We took our apéro with the first snacks on the pretty terrace, this is where we met our main server who didn't seem to like us very much. One of the various small snacks was a ""foie gras bonbon"" but because I had mentioned in advance that I don't like foie gras, I got a little tartlet as an alternative. My friend whispered to me that she had forgotten to mention that she doesn't like liver, so I asked the server if he could bring another tartlet, and the response was: ""The tartlet is the alternative for the person who had mentioned in advance that she does not eat foie gras."" (???) We did not get another tartlet, so I told her to eat mine.   - We only had 3 tables in our room with 4 other people, and we counted 8 servers in total. Most of them were very friendly and nice, except the aforementioned gentleman who was professional but we could tell that he did not warm up to us. Unfortunately, I didn't ask for his name so let's just call him ""Mr. X"" for this review.   - My friend got her first glass of wine and immediately said ""I can mostly smell dishwashing detergent"". She didn't say anything but when it happed again with the third glass of wine, she mentioned it and immediately got a new glass, but the waiter said that they had had the problem before and had tried various solutions... to no avail. If you have had this problem before, I just wonder why servers don't ""check"" glasses before pouring guests wine? At a restaurant of this calibre, you simply can't have glasses smelling of dishwashing detergent!   - Mr. X didn't seem very well-informed with regards to the wines. He would e.g. confuse Spanish and Italian wines, even though he was looking at the bottles when he introduced them.   - We absolutely loved the cheese course which came with various delicious snacks (cured meats, Maluns, a gorgeous panforte, tiny potatoes etc.). A lovely lady explained the different cheeses and put together a little selection for each one of us. At the end, she said that she'd be happy to come back if we'd like another piece of one of the cheeses. Because we loved the cheeses, we did want a little more cheese after we had finished. When we asked Mr. X, he was clearly not amused and told us, that the cheese cart was already gone but if we told him EXACTLY which cheese we wanted, he could MAYBE get us another small piece. I didn't remember the names of the cheeses that I wanted and because he seemed irritated, we just asked for the only one where we could remember details. At this point, our happy mood had vanished, because we felt like a nuisance.    - Our neighbors couldn't finish their bread and asked to take it home with them. The waiters brought out a new bread in a nice box for them (very nice gesture), and when I saw that, I said (more as a joke) ""ohhh, I want one too!"". Mr. X then looked at me with indignation and said ""SERIOUSLY?"".   - At one point, Mr. Caminada himself came out to say ""hello"". He was very professional but also seemed very reserved, it didn't feel like he enjoyed the interaction with the guests, and it was more of an obligation. Our neighbors celebrated their 22nd anniversary and had eaten at Schloss Schauenstein several times in the past. I would expect a Michelin*** restaurant to do something special for such an occasion, and I would expect the chef to know... but he didn't. The couple had to mention to him that they were here for their anniversary, Mr. Caminada said ""oh, congratulations"" and directly moved on to the next table.    - We went back to the terrace for our coffee/tea and the petit fours (beautiful!). I wanted to order a jasmine tea (which is not a very unusual tea choice), and Mr. X told me that they didn't have it, because ""nobody else orders it"". Slightly disappointing as I'm a tea sommelier and would expect at least the most common tea choices in a restaurant like this. We chatted with the lovely couple next to us (who were celebrating their anniversary), and they told us that they had ordered 3 courses for CHF 216 + an extra foie gras starter. What they didn't know, and what nobody told them, was, that the foie gras starter was CHF 95.- extra = they ended up paying CHF 311 for 4 courses, when the 6 courses meal was only CHF 270.   All in all, our experience confirmed why Andreas Caminada is one of the best chefs in the country: All his accolades are well-deserved, and the food was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the service was not. When I pay this kind of price for a meal, I expect the staff to go the extra mile to ensure that I have a fabulous experience, and I want them to HAPPILY bring me whatever I want. I want the same attention to detail which has been poured into all of the dishes which we ate that day. It's just such a pity that so many people work hard to create an experience for the guests but at the end of the day, you will mostly remember the weakest link...   We went to IGNIV the next day and had a better time there: While the food was in our opinion on a similar level, the service was so much warmer, and we felt truly taken care of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r715578014-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,4,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2019-09-22,travelin_tommy,"My wife and I had a wonderful, but costly, experience dining here. The service was impeccable. The ambience was terrific, sitting on the terrace for apperitivi and snacks and later for coffee and dessert, as well as inside for our lengthy meal (since we chose to have multiple dishes from the menu rather than choose a la carte). There were multiple samples of amuse bouche as well as desserts served with the coffee, not counting the multiple different dishes on the menu. Frankly, we did not have any that we thought were less than very good, many were excellent, and also many were surprising in taste combinations we had not previously had nor considered. We have eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants; sometimes we have questioned their stars, but not the three stars awarded here. My only quibble was with the drinks: everything was very expensive. Wine on their selected list to compliment the meal was good but not really exceptional. Furthermore, comparing the price of two wines with which I was familiar on the list of their wines showed a mark-up of >3 times the price easily available elsewhere. My guess is that they make their profit on the wines to pay for the excellent service and food preparation that we experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r711964898-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

2019-07-19,Kellytx78,"My husband and I knew we wanted to take a fabulous trip to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had no idea where we wanted to go though. We love tasting menus so he did some research (shocking!!) and he discovered this amazing hotel & restaurant. We booked our entire trip around this hotel and restaurant. It was definitely worth it. We booked a night at the hotel in the castle and had a reservation for dinner. When we arrived to the train station in Thusis, we had a really kind woman (I can't remember her name though..) pick us up in an Audi A8 which of course my husband loved. She drove us to the castle and the minute we pulled up, I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew from the pictures that it was going to be incredible, but pictures don't do it justice. It is GORGEOUS! The grounds, the flowers, the castle...everything is picture perfect. Check in was super easy and she gave us a tour of the property so we knew where everything was. There are so many adorable little nooks and places on the property for various activities. I won't like - there were so many that I forgot them all! We went to the pool area for awhile, went to the beautiful lawn across from the castle, went to the terrace, went to another outdoor terrace for a few drinks....it was all just perfect. It was so quaint and beautiful, yet really welcoming which was nice. When we got back to our room (we stayed in the Kastanie which has low ceilings, just FYI if you are traveling with anyone tall) and got settled in. The room is so charming. We loved it. Staying in the hotel was the perfect setting too. Anyway, we got a knock on our door while I was getting dressed in the bathroom, but it was the chef's wife! She explained there was a little issue with another hotel guest and the guest needed a special room to accommodate a health concern. My husband and I were happy to move rooms, so we packed our stuff and headed downstairs to the lobby. On our way down, we passed Marco (more about him later) and he was determined to carry our luggage for us, but my husband refused to let him. He was so kind and really wanted to carry it, but my husband is stubborn. Ha! Anyway, we ran into Sarah and Enna (I think that was how it's spelled) on the stairs. Enna oversees the dinner service I believe. They explained that the guest had solved their issue by switching with another couple they were with so we didn't have to change rooms after all. Sarah was soooo apologetic and kind, and we could tell she felt really bad about us packing our stuff. We really didn't mind though and we told her it was completely fine. I joked with her and told her I just wanted to meet her husband because I had researched the restaurant and the hotel and was seriously fascinated and inspired by him. She said she'd gladly tell him to come meet us during dinner. Needless to say, I was really excited. We got dressed, and headed to one of the loveliest rooms for the Apertif. Words can't explain the beauty of this room. The ceiling detail was stunning and so beautiful. The walls were painted with these gorgeous paintings. I can't even describe it because it's simply stunning, but in a very charming and welcoming way. My favorite colors are pink and green and there were accents of them in the room, which also was just so pretty! They seated us at a small table and greeted us with a glass of complimentary champagne from Sarah. It was really nice of them. They also took our picture for our anniversary which was a perfect momento from our evening. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I won't go into detail, but the dinner was AMAZING. It was absolutely the most exquisite dinner we've ever had. It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. Marco was one of our main servers and he was the best. He was funny, charming, so kind and really made our experience an even better one. All of the service team was very nice. He and Alexander were the ones who really made the best impression because they were so friendly. We are from Texas and like to talk so they were really nice to talk to us. I could tell they read their diners really well because a few other diners didn't seem as chatty as we were and they weren't as chatty with them. Anyway, they were great. Towards the end of our dinner, Chef Andreas came to our table and talked to us. He was so friendly and it was surreal. I'd read so much about him so the fact that he comes and introduces himself and thanked us was so impactful. He greeted all the tables, but I asked him if I could take a picture with him and he said he'd be happy to. We went to the lobby, snapped a pic and mentioned to him that it would be great if he was around the next day so we could get a picture of him with something we'd brought (something from my husband's job which wouldn't make sense unless you're from Texas). He said he'd be around in the morning and to let the front desk know when we were available. We said bye, got a cocktail to go and walked outside to the terrace to look at the beautiful grounds again. They're illuminated at night and it's like a fairy tale. The next day, we went to breakfast (which was soooo good. The croissants are the best I've ever had) and then we strolled around again and decided to stop at the Casa Caminada (his newest hotel property on the grounds which is a little more casual). It was really cool and obviously didn't have the history of the castle, but it was really beautiful, yet trendy, yet classic. Hard to explain. The floors are awesome though. Anyway, there is a bakery in there and a coffee area in the restaurant so we got a cup of coffee and went to sit outside. We had mentioned to the front desk that if Sarah or the Chef was around and available, that'd be great, but no worries if not. We didn't really think they'd come by, but about 5 minutes later, they did! We chatted for a bit, took another picture and Chef went to go about his day, but Sarah talked to us for a while. She is wonderful. If you get a chance to meet her, definitely do because she's one of the kindest women I've ever met. She and I had a lot in common because of kids, etc. so it was really nice talking to her and learning more about the hotels and IGNIV. If you don't know about it, look it up for sure.  After a lovely chat with her, it was time for us to go back to the train station. I was so so sad to leave because it was just incredible, but it was the PERFECT anniversary in the perfect location. It's breathtaking and the food can't even be put into words. Simply put - if you're planning a trip to Switzerland, you MUST stay at this castle and dine at the restaurant. If you aren't planning a trip, do it because you won't regret it and you'll make memories that will last a lifetime. They made such a great impression on us and we absolutely cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2080066-d2069731-r690892599-Schloss_Schauenstein_Restaurant-Fuerstenau_Canton_of_Graubunden_Swiss_Alps.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

Take the way through the garden, the view in the castle is breathtaking.

Hardly ever have I enjoyed a lunch lasting over 4:30hrs and wished for more.  Hint: if it’s warm/sunny, try having the aperitif on the terrace, even better on the tower.  The food, well it’s a piece of art and I won’t try comparing it to anything because I just do t have the words for it.

2019-02-13,MarinMarais,"I was really looking forward to dinner at Schloss Schauenstein and in the end, it was mostly what could be expected from an evening at a star restaurant. Attentive and knowledgeable staff, nice atmosphere, high level of complexity in courses and an interesting wine pairing. The most disappointing course was the cheese which I found unremarkable in taste and in which I believe made my stomach sour at the end of the evening. I could appreciate the time and care that goes into creating, preparing and serving a multitude of complexities on a dish, but in the end, it’s a long evening (from 19.00-almost 23.30 when we finally finished dessert in the main dining room) of hodgepodge different courses that don’t necessarily go together or complement each other. I was looking for more harmony in what was presented. I’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, this was the first 3* and I would hope that 3* and the prices that go with it would warrant something especially creative or special but it wasn’t my opinion of the evening at the Schloss. Everything was executed to an extremely high standard but it just failed the wow factor for me, it was just lacking soul. I left thinking that the price wasn’t worth the evening. It’s a pure question of taste, of course, as the quality is definitely there, but for me it was just a technically ambitious variety show of amouse bouche, tasting dishes and desserts. The expectations for a 3* restaurant are probably unreasonable, but I think the main reason people are drawn to these restaurants is to leave feeling inspired in one way or another by the chef’s creativity.  Perhaps I am expecting too much, but I suspect that Caminada’s taste is perhaps just not my taste, and that’s ok, because it seems he impresses and inspires more than enough people!

So, yes, visiting Schloss Schauenstein is a MUST. The “but”, though is related to the staff.

2018-12-09,HansM,"Of course, it is an expensive place to go to - but still, it is great value for money - and the wines are have better prices than in many less exclusive restaurants! For me, a restaurant has to satisfy me in three dimensions: Food - Ambiance - Staff and Andreas Caminada and his team make sure that all these dimensions are taken care of. You really feel welcome and at home, there are no stiff upper lips or french-style waiter snobbishness, everything goes easy but, as you can expect, is highly professional. This time round, we were very happy with the food which had the seasonal touch of fall-winter, but was still colorful and presented a happy contrast to the weather outside. Leave room for the cheese board which is full of excellent specialties from the region and even comes with some small blue local potatoes. Ms Junge does an excellent job with the wines. And last but not least, this is the restaurant where the chef shows presence, bids farewell to the guests. Overall, again a great experience.

2018-08-02,malli42,"As mentioned in my other tripadvisor comments, this year we chose Andreas Caminada and the restaurant Schauenstein as our yearly 3* experience.   And also in a nutshell, overwhelming. This comments reflects also the hotel experience... from the first contact up to the last view there is absolutely nothing to complain about.   Hotel: We stayed in the room ""Wasser"", which is a double room located at the top of the main building. As we arrived pretty early a very nice host showed us everything and explained all facilities and possibilities. You have to imagine, that this is a relatively small castle, but there are hints and secret corners to relax, to sunbath, to crab some food & wine - simply to enjoy. Many thanks to the complete staff. But if you are interested to stay here, please have a closer look before choosing a room. In our room the shower was a bathtub in the middle of the room, the toilet was separated with translucent glass. Actually we liked it.   Restaurant: As many others wrote, marvellous. The weather was great, so we started with the aperitif and small snacks on the beautiful terrace. Here we also enjoyed the last glass of wine and petit fours after the marvellous dinner. Between these two delicacies we were faced a incredible genius menu, based only on local food (and it is incredible what is possible with this local stuff). Ok, two courses were weak compared to the others. But this is highly depend on personal taste.

At the set time of dinner we walked the short distance to the restaurant and were warmly greeted outside by the owner and chef - what a nice welcome. The menu for the dinner was set, so we only had to choose wine. However, here was the only less positive point of the experience, as the prices on the wine card were unreasonable high (cost to qualify), So we opted for the wine pairing, which I usually don’t do - this was actually quite fine.

During the evening we were taken exceptionally well care of by the team - they are just so attentive and enthusiastic.

Many small servings based on local produce, strong on umami whether veggie, fish or meat that to excellent sauces. Cooking takes place over open fires outside also in winter, and sitting outdoors briefly around the fire for a quick æbleskive with gooseberry filling was brilliant, if a bit nippy.

2021-03-18,Henry,"Last fridag I had the distinct pleasure of dining in the spectacular restaurant Knystaforsen.  The place is absolutely magical, the people fantastic and the food.... Oh boy the food... AMAZING and almost impossible to describe. Like trying to describe a midsummer sundown to a blind man.  15 courses of utter sensory perfection created by the wizard chef Nicolai Tram. No shortcuts, No limits, 100% local. 1000% delicious and astonishing looking dishes.  From the moose tartar with pike roe - to cured pikeperch jaws smoked on juniper berry branches... I was left with goosebumps several times and my jaw dropped to many times i looked like a fish out of water.  Paired with wonderful wines and non alcoholic curiosity’s by sommelier Eva Helbæk Tram. Mind blowing and inspiring. Fireweed flower made into a sparkling dream!!   Guys this has to go on your bucket list!!  A huge thanks to wizard chef Nicolai Tram & super-sommelier Eva Helbæk Tram for a fireworks night never to forget.   P.s. If you find a hobbo outside your kitchendoor begging for scraps.

We chose menu extreme and the surprise could begin. We were served the dishes quickly, in my opinion much too quickly. It all tasted very good except for the pork fat croissant. This one was really too big and not our favourite. Unfortunately, my table companion did not feel well, no, that was not due to the food, so we ended the evening early. So we were not able to enjoy the full menu and ended the evening with a feeling of guilt. Fortunately, all understanding came from the staff and they were kind enough not to charge for the full menu. Which we offcourse would have fully understood if they had. I certainly hope to be able to return one day to fully experience it. I do have a point of attention.

Every aspect was perfection - from the minute we entered the restaurant to our very last morsel - the attention to detail is found everywhere.

2022-09-15,Candi,"Prior to visiting Andreu Genestra, we were excited to try the tasting menu and the hyper-locally produced dishes.   However, our expectations weren't met. The restaurant's head server was far from obliging, which is rare in a Michelin-rated restaurant. We've never experienced such arrogance or inability to be flexible whatsoever. We almost left before ordering, which we deeply regret not doing.   Since we saw the sommelier greeting tables with such positivity, we ordered the wine pairing but were disappointed when our table didn't receive the same treatment and attention as others nearby.   While the dishes on the tasting menu were stunningly presented, they lacked flavor and inspiration with some dishes relying on a heavy dose of salt as the main seasoning. During the service, we felt that the pacing between menu items was hurried and didn't give us time to enjoy the outside atmosphere.   A friendlier staff would have slightly enhanced our experience, but in conclusion, we had higher expectations for a night that cost 500 EUR.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r860236024-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,2,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

2021-09-05,Koen A,We were looking forward to our gastronomic evening in Mallorca but Andreu Genestra at CAPDEPERA was slightly disappointing.   We took the signature menu and there were some courses which were excellent but some others were not to the level as you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant.   The waiters were very nice but they could not explain all dishes which is again a bit weird in such so-called top-notch restaurant.   We gladly spent some money for a beautiful gastronomic dinner but here we were not so glad about spending 420 Euros (for two persons) at this restaurant.

Naturally we were really rooting for their prized Michelin starred dining, but unfortunately it feel slightly short basis our experience of these calibre restaurants. Regrettably, I agree with other reviewers there are courses within the tasting menu that are hit and miss, and at times real flavour and spark is missing. Off the sensations menu the homemade olive oil and tapenade was just wonderful, but while the peanut course was bereft of any punch or flavour. The only true Michelin style standard came with the rice/foie based course which was rich and intense but poorly followed by a mushy Ray(didn’t feel fresh), and a very bland suckling pig - the cracking was flavourless. To be clear the staff were fantastic and knowledgable over the whole evening, and I really enjoyed the wine pairings - the tarragona fortified wine with the cheese was superb. I worry that maybe a bit of complacency is creeping in, and perhaps a bit of reinvention is needed to get it back to the gastronomic standard Andreu Genestre must wield. The surroundings are lush, and the local farm concept is superb. All the best for the future.

2021-06-30,Hobbitu,"It was quite a mixed bag. Some very interesting flavors and combinations. But mostly pushing the experimental aspect too far and missing out on a solid, delicious basis. There are no dishes from the sensations tasting menu we would love to have for a main another day. The modern interpretation of Crêpe Suzette at the end and the olive oil course in the beginning were probably the best.  Unfortunately there were some „mistakes“ for a star rated restaurant. We asked, for example, to slow down the pace after delivering first few courses literally plate after plate. They did that for one course and went immediately back to the super fast pace afterwards. Or we were alcohol free the whole night (not by choice!) and got juice pairing but got served a brandy as part of the dessert without even been asked or offered an alcohol free alternative. Lastly, the portion size was just too big (in particular the aubergine and rice dish) and we asked them to cut half the portions and to share the desserts. The former ended up in a not so nicely, literally pulled off some parts of the main component.  The location appears beautiful at first sight but is mediocre at the best. It’s lacking style and interior design.

It is tiring and dull to be given a lecture before every course about what you are about to eat . Like conceptual art that only makes sense when someone explains it to you first. It would be better if the food were allowed to speak for itself. But it would also help if the staff did not speak like automatons programmed to give the same explanation of every dish - but not as if they meant it - to be fair it is hard to be expressive when you are wearing a mask.

We enjoyed many of the courses and in particular the earlier ones of oil, fruit soup (pictured), veggie terrine and falafel, but the later courses were not for us (tuna, prawn, puddings). The cheese plate was gorgeous though. Also we didn’t expect so much food and length of time (again probably our inexperience).

2020-07-24,Zillah,"As l promised in my last review of the Predi Son Jaumell Hotel Rural, l will now be featuring our experience in the one Michelin Star restaurant which belongs to the maestro chef, Andreu Genestra. The restaurant is made up of inner and outside dining areas. We have dined in both and had equally nice experiences. The layout is quite simple, but pleasant. I actually prefer the outside restaurant as it overlooks the beautiful gardens with their spacious lounging areas. The view at sunset is simply spectacular.  Apart from the exquisite meals one is bound to experiences here, Andreu Genestra’s choice of various types of exotic tableware are also a sight to behold - very unique and unusual! His sense of innovative style was also displayed in the presentation of the cheeses which are served on broken earthenware which put together form the shape of the island of Mallorca. 👍🏾The meals are very tasty, artistically presented and truly representative of the different regional flavours. The maestro chef himself also always makes the point to come out to greet guests, as well as personally serving out  dishes while giving background information about these. It’s always a pleasure to eat here and enjoy the culinary experience! 👍🏾",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r761363851-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

Late afternoon we made a reservation via their website, leaving the credit card details for a reservation for that evening and awaited confirmation. It did not arrive and not being able to get anyone by phone to check they were expecting us and given the restaurant was a 40 min drive away, we made other arrangements. Then one hour after the time of the requested reservation a Genestra colleague called asking where were we. We explained the situation and how disappointed we were. Bearing in mind this all took place in a 5 hour window, the Andreu Genestra  maître d′ decided to charge £60 per person cancellation fee and took the payment from the credit card. A rather mean act by an individual who has no care for the value of tourists or the reputation of the restaurant. I have no doubt the food is as stated, but recommend than NO ONE leaves their credit card details on there for fear it could be abused.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g673340-d3745964-r708842518-Andreu_Genestra-Llucmajor_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,2,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

2024-10-03,Cemil G,"I had been to Neolokal a few times some years ago, pre-Covid, and was happy with my meals. It then served very good Turkish cuisine with a touch of sophistication.  In the meantime, NeoLokal got awarded a Michelin star and a Green Michelin star. Unfortunately, my recent visit was unfortunately a pretty bad experience. It has become a pretty pretentious restaurant (watching a small film on an iPad before a dish ??!!), with non describable bland food and pretentious, haughty service. We had chosen one of the 2  wine flights proposed to accompany our meal (fixed menu), and the sommelier had described all the wines on the flight. However, the last 2 wines served were different than the ones described and were rest of bottles (presumably from another wine flight) - we literally  received tasting portions for the last 2 wines as there wasn't much left in the bottles. I presume the sommelier didn't want to open new bottles for us, as we were the last table in the mostly empty restaurant. Food was uniformly bland, with the best dish being the one presented by the iPad video (based on morel mushrooms, which, ironically for a green star michelin, are not in season).  To cap this off, the bill came to 250 euros per head. I don't remember the last time I've had such bad value for money.  I can't say whether the restaurant received the star based on the experience I've had, or was ruined after the Michelin star by changing its cuisine and jacking up the prices. Regardless, this was pretty bad on all fronts.  There's much better food to be had in Istanbul at more reasonable prices. I'm steering well clear in future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r972368794-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,2,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2024-09-26,J2024,"A certain price range brings certain expectations whether you consider that fair or unfair is up to the individual.  So What do I expect at this price range? Exemplary, knowledgeable friendly service and a memorable meal great across the board with at least a couple of truely outstanding dishes.  So I made a reservation for 9 pm had been in contact with the restaurant throughout the week. I arrived at 2015 approx intention to have a couple or more cocktails seated at the bar said to host brought me outside past the bar to the seated area at this stage if I wasn’t going to be able to sit at the bar I would rather be inside with a view so I asked to be put inside by a window . I managed one cocktail Aztec dream quite nice but were pushing to get started I think they asked me for my menu chiloices this is where I knew there would be issues because I had already been emailed in advance and asked for my menu choices in my case the standard tasting menu and the premium wine pairing system allegedly because the restaurant espouses a sustainable ethos and only does enough to match customers on the night fair enough great idea in practice but obviously wasn’t true or a sloppy night since I had already picked but I  finished my cocktail looking for another but they had already started with the food again well before 2100 so I just went with the wine, asked for the wi fi access again took ages.  Of the food the mushroom morel was great, the lamb three styles was at least interesting and the bonito was the one dish that matched my expectations fabulous across the board everything else completely forgettable.  The premium wine list was at least interesting a collection of premium Turkish wines I am not familiar with Turkish wines and it was a pleasure to become acquainted but even there when I ventured a couple of questions at the sommelier he looked at me blankly and walked away which to be fair may have been just a language barrier.however the fact that no one from beginning to end including when I was paying asked me how I got on is, at this level, unforgivable maybe the fact I was a solo diner was a factor? Look not the worst meal I ever had , not by a long shot, but at this level Michelin it was the only one where I have been slightly frustrated and very bored throughout make of that what you will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r971486180-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,2,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

Some of the dishes are a bit foreign for a Western European palate but worth trying out. I for one LOVED their mushroom dish and at the same time disliked their fish dish - their take on fish’n chips (see picture).  The service was OK but felt a little distant and stressed.

Neolokal tasting menu is a ""gourmet' take on Turkish cuisine that sometime seemed to be trying too hard.  We were particularly amused by the pretentious video they made of their morel mushroom course as were several other guests.  Not necessary as the entree spoke for itself.   Several of the courses arrived lukewarm and we felt for the staff which had to truck every course up a significant flight of stairs (kitchen on different level than guests).

2024-06-07,Simon Baker,"Once upon a time, a quirky artist decided to swap his canvas for a plate and took his talents to Neolokal, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Istanbul. The artist’s mission? To create a feast for the eyes, if not for the taste buds.  As we entered Neolokal, we were greeted by a gallery of glassware and ceramics that could make a museum curator green with envy. Each plate was a canvas, and each dish a masterpiece—but only in appearance. It’s as if Neolokal hired Michelangelo to plate their food, but left the cooking to someone who thinks salt and pepper are exotic spices.  The meal began with an array of appetizers that looked like they were designed by a team of architects. Each bite was visually stunning, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, like a modern art piece you almost feel guilty for eating. However, one nibble in and you realize that the excitement ends at the eyes. The flavors were fresh and authentic, yes, but boring.  Then there was the foam. Oh, the foam! So many dishes came with its own fluffy cloud, a frothy crown atop each plate. It felt like Neolokal had an obsession with foam, perhaps believing it could carry the flavor burden. Instead, it felt like we were dining in a culinary car wash, where every taste got lost in a sea of bubbles. The foam was everywhere—salads, mains, even the desserts &  cocktails. I half-expected my coffee to come with a side of foam, and a barista in a scuba suit.  The following courses continued the trend—each one a Picasso on a plate, visually breathtaking but with flavors that were more 50 shades of beige. The dishes didn’t push any flavor boundaries; they played it safe, opting for elegance over excitement. Neolokal’s approach seemed to be ‘dress to impress,’ but they forgot that our tongues don’t care about haute couture—they want a flavor explosion, not a fashion show.  As we sipped our wine from glasses that looked like they were sculpted by Rodin himself, we couldn’t help but feel a little underwhelmed. Neolokal delivered a sensory feast for the eyes, but left our taste buds yearning for something more daring, something that would challenge and excite. It was a meal that satisfied the Instagram feed, but left the palate looking for more.  In the end, Neolokal is a place where the plate is the star, and the food is its understudy. It’s a restaurant that knows how to wow visually, but needs to remember that eating is not just about looking—it’s about tasting, and that’s where they missed the mark. If you’re after a meal that’s as beautiful as a museum exhibit but tastes like a chef’s day off, then Neolokal is your destination. Just don’t expect your taste buds to send a post card.   Oh and whilst money isn't everything, they charged €450  for three glasses of cognac. An entire bottle is €350... #justsayin",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r954117817-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,3,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2024-04-06,Curtis H,"Yes, this is a one star.  And yes, some of the dishes are first rate.  But it is a model of just how silly (or pretentious, or fussy) some contemporary restaurants can be.  The technique behind every dish is impressive (and time consuming and very very expensive).  But the technical accomplishments seem less important than the taste.  For one dish, for example, an iPad is brought to your table and you are required to watch an overblown video on “The soil.  The fire.  The dish” and such.  Great view.  Great wine choices.  And a waiter that is the spitting image of Uriah Heep.

2024-03-20,Ajay N,"We went to Neolokal for dinner because it has a 1 Michelin Star and a Michelin Green Star. We got the vegetarian tasting menu for reference.  Overall, it was great food - the presentation and flavors are everything you would expect from a Michelin restaurant. That also includes the service. The food was tasty and so were the drinks.   I'd say the only critique I have is I wish our server took more time explaining the ingredients of the dishes - often time he would mention what the dish's name was and serve. Also, there is one part of the tasting menu where they give you a tablet to watch a video on how the dish they are about to serve is made. This part of the tasting menu felt a little gimmicky. Also, the price of this dinner is on par with Michelin restaurants in the US - be prepared to pay $200+ for 2 people.  It's a restaurant worth going to and the food, service, and overall quality shows why it has a Michelin star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r943217513-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2023-12-12,Mahmut b,"Neolokal's Tasting Menu is a gastronomic journey that seamlessly blends traditional Turkish flavors with modern culinary innovation. The experience begins with the enticing aroma of their SOURDOUGH bread, served with parsley-marbled butter and cep mushroom powder—a delightful start to the meal.  The Amuse Bouches showcase the chef's creativity, with standout dishes like SINKONTA, featuring olive oil-braised pumpkin and zucchini varieties, complemented by a pumpkin and mandarin sauce, onion, and vegetable foam. BONITO presents an olive oil-braised spotless black-eyed pea 'pilaki' with tarragon and fish sauce, delivering a harmonious fusion of flavors.  The MOREL DUMPLING is a culinary masterpiece, combining mushroom sauce and emulsion with sautéed morel and isot oil. The BLUEFISH with CHARD, accompanied by a shrimp sheet and shrimp sauce, offers a delicate balance of textures and tastes. A refreshing interlude comes in the form of the SORREL SORBET, cleansing the palate for the next culinary delights.  The main course features the SLOW COOKED LAMB, accompanied by a unique combination of meatball and 'kokoreç,' served with sweet bean 'piyaz.' The dish exemplifies Neolokal's commitment to incorporating traditional Turkish elements into their contemporary creations.  For dessert, the REVANİ WITH ROSE is a sweet symphony, showcasing rose milk ice cream, rose delight, and coconut meringue—an elegant and fitting conclusion to the meal. To add an element of surprise, the Neolokal team presents an array of delightful desserts, rounding off the dining experience on a high note.  The Tasting Menu at Neolokal is a testament to the culinary prowess of Chef Maksut Aşkar and his team. Each dish is a work of art, skillfully combining flavors, textures, and presentation. The restaurant's commitment to showcasing the diversity of Turkish cuisine, coupled with a touch of surprise in the desserts, makes dining at Neolokal a memorable and delightful experience This is more than a meal; it's a celebration of culinary ingenuity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d7178552-r929265938-Neolokal-Istanbul.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

2023-11-22,Aldo C,"We enter a beautiful building a few minutes from the Galata Tower. Going up to the first floor, there is a mezzanine. You enter directly into the restaurant, or rather a completely open space with a visible kitchen. There is no one at the entrance, which gives you the feeling of being in a canteen. From the kitchen you go up a flight of stairs and only at the top is anyone there to greet you and escort you to your table. We asked for a nice table with a view and were satisfied. So far so good, they help us to sit down, take our coats and immediately present us with the menus, food, wines and cocktails.  We had already chosen the menu, we had been asked to do so by email in the days before our arrival in Istanbul. We ask for two cocktails, very good and well made, but to accompany them they only bring us some salted gherkins and roasted hazelnuts. They could do much better! I choose the wine with the help of the maitre sommelier, who gives me good advice. There are plenty of waiters and maitre sommeliers, as well as guys with trays bringing food from downstairs to the room. All the staff were dressed formally, with an alternative twist of white trainers. The service is quite attentive (we are in a Michelin starred restaurant! let's not forget! ), but you feel like a number, not a  guest. To underline this, the chef and co-owner, despite being in the room several times and interacting  and sit with only one table ... completely forgetting about all the other guests seated there.  He had no regard for the other diners in his restaurant. This is a serious omission in a Michelin Star  restaurant. As we had a tasting menu, we did not feel taken on a culinary journey. Some dishes,  refined in their presentation, bat all lacked something... a pity. Personally, I expected much more given the level of the restaurant. Overrated. Bad idea to use a tablet and headphones to explain a dish....Where is the Chef??  Note: if you run out of the little bread they give you at the beginning, they don't bring it . We appreciated the petit four they gave us at the end. Price: very very expensive for the experience we had.

2023-08-19,Joseph W,"Disappointed. We have eaten in many Michelin one star (and two star) restaurants in a number of countries and  therefore expected a better level.  Pricing - was middle to high for this level. Euro 305 without drinks for 6 course tasting menu, including automatic 12% service charge for two people.  Location - upper floor with a very good view for approx half the dinners.  Staff - ok but not great. Polite and plenty of them but not switched on. Very basic presentation and explanation of dishes. Had to ask them to repeat explanations. One excellent point was a little booklet that gave background on each dish on the tasting menu. Although the ingredients didn’t alway seem to match what was actually on the plate. I would not complain about the service but equally it was not professional enough. For instance the first time we were asked if we were enjoying the meal was as we were paying the bill.  Food - for us this is the key element and this is why we can only score them at 3 out of five. Presentation on the plate was very good. Variety of tastes, intensities and textures was not at the right standard. Vegetables in particular were disappointing - too many beans and nothing much else to balance it. Two main courses - black bass and shredded beef. The fish was blended into a purée consistency and lacking identifiable flavours while the beef was very rich without sufficient balancing flavours and texture.  So overall the food was good, just not at the expected level. Staff were pleasant and lots of them but also not at the correct professional level. To put it in context we had an excellent meal the previous evening at 40% of the cost in a great setting, with a similar level of service.

There is also booth seating for larger groups. The menu is complex and modern, and changes every couple of months to match availability of fresh ingredients.

It’s yummy food in any context due to the combination of flavors and delicate preparation.   It could be considered expensive if you don’t appreciate the effort that goes into sourcing amazing local ingredients and preparing them in a manner that honors their heritage.    But it’s cheap if you do have some understanding of fresh produce, preparation and cooking to produce an incredible balance of tastes within each course.   This is effectively a Japanese degustation and there were a couple of course that my wife and I wouldn’t have ordered a la Carte. But given that we enjoyed everything and the entire meal was well balanced.   Don’t miss this restaurant if you’re a Foodie visiting Kyoto for only a few days.

We ate at several Michelin-starred restaurants across Japan, and Nakahigashi is extraordinary in the pack.  The chef's use of vegetables that he collects and his obvious desire to connect with diners are extraordinary.  We began the evening upstairs in a private room, but when 2 counter seats cleared, the chef invited us down and made us feel like part of the family. The food is on par with the hospitality.

2015-11-28,victoriouswong,"The very best meal I had in Tokyo and Kyoto was here. It's a 2-star Michelin restaurant that is very hard to make a reservation (only about a dozen seats and a lot of regulars who make reservations in advance). However, if you can splurge and get in, then you'll be in for a treat of your life. Our hotel concierges (Ritz Carlton and the Yoshikawa Inn both tried for us) were able to get us on a waitlist and fortunately someone dropped out. Normally you need to book at least a month in advance.  The chef/owner goes and forages the mountain every day for fresh produce (it's basically the Japanese version of Noma). There's a heavy emphasis on the local vegetables and seasonality. There's also a bent towards seafood protein over land. There are so many courses and you'll leave full no matter how hungry you are.   You can't really recommend a particular thing cause the menu changes so often but basically expect to taste whatever season you're in and the local flavors. Everything was just so beautifully presented and tasted like the embodiment of the season at its peak.  The chef tried his best to speak English to us and did a pretty good job actually of explaining the intricate dishes and their ingredients. Some of the regular patrons who had superior English helped out in explaining but it's clear that they don't get as many non-Japanese guests as Japanese guests. But they were all very kind and helpful, which made the whole evening so wonderful to share the experience with such kind strangers.  You can tell the chef takes enormous pride in his food and has a lot of confidence in his skills -- as he should.   In the end, the chef even walked us out to our taxi and gave us his business card which was a very nice touch. I will remember this experience forever as truly magical and as having transformed my perspective on Japanese cuisine and what's possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r329624309-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2015-06-05,Jurgen B,"Very good price quality ratio. Really worth his two Michelin stars, even to Belgian standards. We were so lucky somebody cancelled the day before so we could get in. We were also lucky his cute son was in the country since he could explain all the courses in detail in fluent English. They did not offer alcoholic beverages right away, we had to ask for them, they don't have a drinks menu. What makes it even more authentic. So glad afterwards, when we got the bill, their sakes were at very normal prices. Also the incredible, typical Japanese courtesy by the chef and his son to follow us outside and greeting us at the taxi door. Important to know: this is natural cuisine, not cooking special combinations like French top cuisine, which remains therefore a higher category than the Japanese, as far as I am concerned. Still absolutely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r278130838-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks
2015-02-27,GastronomicHunter,"Having been unable to secure a booking at some of the more sought after Kaiseki in Kyoto such as the legendary Mizai and unwilling to fork out for Kitcho - we decided to try a Kaiseki that was rated highly by the locals on Tabelog and also rated by the Michelin guide at 2 stars.   I must premise this review in saying that three of the four members present for the meal had never tried Kaiseki.  I will keep this review relatively brief and highlight the best and worst.  Food - First dish with a selection of mountain flowers, local fish, and vegetables was out of this world. The flavours and textures contained within a single dish in every single element of the plate demonstrated an exceptional understanding of both produce and the combination of flavours. Together, it demonstrates a level of precision and thinking that few chefs have. Easily a very solid 3 star dish.   Many of the other dishes after this were excellent. The clear broth, the crispy fish bones, the old style mackerel ""cheese"" sushi. A great deal of these were solid 2 if not 3 star dishes.   However, some of  the other dishes in the middle received mixed feelings from the party. Some such as the carp with vegetables were extremely pungent and powerful - and whether it was excellent or terrible could be based on personal preference. Later dishes such as the salted river fish was also excessively salty and the 'breakfast' plate confounded the party. One party member suggested that the meal had become too intense.   However the ending showed Nakahigashi's genius in understanding flavours and textures. The dessert of a sake sorbet over grapefruit with a slice of dried fig and a piece of dark chocolate was a flash of genius. The balance of the mild cold sake against the texture and slight bitterness of the grapefruit already represented a high level of gastronomic understanding. The addition of the sweet but dried fig and the dark chocolate added a new dimension to the dish. The ability to create such an incredible marriage of flavours and textures from just four ingredients is  truly remarkable. This simple dessert is truly one of the best, if not the best dish i've ever eaten.   Food - Overall the food was incredible. Although there were some mistakes, some dishes were simply mind blowing. The quality, skill and thought would give this place a solid 2.5 stars.   Service - Extremely well received. Nakahigashi made an effort to speak in english to us and made sure we were well taken care of. The wife? was very thoughtful. Small things like spilt broth was cleaned from placemats between every course. Overall service was 3 stars.   Ambience/Atmosphere - Nice traditional counter top seating allowed us front row seats to preparation. Very clean. In context of japan, would rate interior/ambience at 2 stars.   Value - at 70k Yen for 4 people this was a very memorable kaiseki experience and I consider this relatively good value.   Overall - Excellent food and excellent service. Solid 2 michelin star restaurant. If several dishes from the middle had been removed I might even have thought this was 3 star level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298564-d1766589-r256649176-Soujiki_Nakahigashi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

Included in the menu is also lots of appetizers and some very impressing petir four (I find how some restaurants have replaced their petit four with a single chocolate or a small candy quite annoying), a nice gesture from the kitchen.  The menu is new nordic in inspiration, based on local produce, but also give out a nod or two to more continental cuisine (for instance by serving their take on the entrecôte - god bless them!), and while the food might not be life-altering and mindblowing (ate at Daniel Bärlin the previous night - wow), it's genuinelly tasty and very well excecuted. Some new combinations, like a delicious creme fraiche dessert and lovely asparagus was really good.  Summed up: high-quality food in a very relaxing atmosphere near Copenhagen, definetily recommended! Denmark are lucky to have these restaurants popping up all over the country!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1931733-d4419609-r370662586-Hotel_Frederiksminde-Praestoe_Vordingborg_Municipality_South_Zealand_Zealand.html,5,en,person_4_removed_line_breaks

The team was incredibly friendly and attentive, which made the evening even more enjoyable. A special highlight was the excellent wine pairing. The selection of Danish wines was impressive and paired perfectly with the dishes served. We were particularly thrilled by the quality and diversity of the Danish wines introduced to us. The restaurant's concept of focusing on local and sustainable products was reflected not only in the food but also in the overall philosophy of the establishment. This approach is not only commendable but also contributed to the uniqueness of our culinary experience.

Also I recommend trying the rhubarb gin it’s super delicious!

2021-12-19,Danes-abroad,"Domestic have given me some of my best gourmet experiences ever. However this time they did not match my expectations. The menu and the wine menu didn't bring the best out in each other and the taste sensation we were left with was sour and the odour putrid. The end result was indigestion.  The staff was as always alert and competent and the  servings was  beautifully presented - that is the only reason it is not a 1 star review.   I had the sensation that the owner is making a lot of experiments which is great, however he have forgotten the saying ""kill your darlings"" - it might be a fun and unique experiment but that doesn't mean it is good. An example was the homemade sparkling apple based ""wine"".  If Domestic  is unable to match existing products in the market (f.ex.

The kitchen is still very dogmatic and experimental but I found it to less ""over-the-edge"" this time than on previous visits; like they are more rooted in their concept. The menu was still very exiting but each dish came with a depth that I hadn't experienced before. They certainly did seem to have a beedrock of confidence in the way the food was presented.   Still visually beautiful creations. The snack w. duck heart, lobster tail and grilled purple cale was out of this world. The best dish was the celariac w. mussels. Halibut w. flowers and sauce was visually stunning and flavourful and the duck was cooked to perfection.

2021-08-05,tlowens75,"Let me first say that Restaurant Domestic is a bit hard to find - you go into a courtyard off the main road and need to follow the signs. Not too hard, just a bit unexpected since it doesn't face the main road.  Even though it's a Michelin-starred restaurant, it seems very warm and casual. We started our evening on the outside porch, then moved in for the rest of our meal. The tables are well-spaced out - I don't know if that's a social distancing thing or just normal, but it made it seemed relaxed inside.  So the meal consisted of 18 courses/pairings (the ""discovery"" menu - they offer a shorter one with 11 - the ""insight"")! That seems huge, I know - but most of the items are 2-3 bites. You will leave full at the end of the night, though. You could pick from three drink pairings: juices/kombucha, classic wines, or ""curious"" wines. We went with the curious because why not? We had some very adventurous and non-traditional wines - like unusual grape varieties or unique fermentation methods. I don't think any of the wines were Danish; that rule only applies to the food, I guess.  All the food is sourced from Denmark, hence the name ""Domestic."" It's actually a pretty cool concept, as the chefs need to come up with unique pairings based on what is available locally and in season. You get a little bit of everything: seafood, beans, bread, flowers, fruits, meat. I really enjoyed the plaice/peas and the miso/koji pairings in particular. The platings are unique and little works of art. My husband and I enjoyed every minute of our meal and left feeling full, yet relaxed. Service was fantastic and shared by pretty much all of the waitstaff. It's expensive, but worth it.  Warning: don't plan on doing much else for the evening if you pick the full dinner experience.

All in all very good, but is it 1 star Michelin quality, on par with other cities like Barcelona, Lisbon or London? I very much have my doubts.

In terms of the tasting 4 course, tartare of beef was bland, pork main also uninspiring, mushrooms too greasy. Local cod good, but nothing wow, though Jerusalem artichoke was fab.

The 45-customer restaurant continues the Catalonian focus but given spectacular depth and scope by Joan’s adaptive creativity.  Feasting on a signature degustacion offering like, say, the “Festival Menu” that we enjoyed, the questing diner understands why Joan’s impressively realized gustatory imaginings made El Celler de Can Roca one of the only four restaurants with multiple “Best Restaurant in the World” accolades - at par with Napa’s “The French Laundry” with two, and only behind the legendary “El Bulli” and Copenhagen’s “Noma” at five Firsts each.  The lagniappe to the experience was to encounter Joan himself three times during the night and engage him in increasingly playful interactions.

2024-05-21,Anna M,"We travelled to Girona specifically to visit this restaurant.  We were so excited to get a reservation and built our trip around this visit.  We wanted to visit after seeing the Chef's Table episode on Netflix and were expecting something very special.  We have been to many Michelin restaurants with a few 3 star under our belts.  This experience was very average and does not align with what one would expect for a 3 star rating.  It was awkward from the moment we entered where there was no one at the front to greet us and we stood around looking for someone to help us out.  We thought maybe we came through the wrong door!!  Not a single question was asked of why we were there (Anniversary, Birthday, etc.) , where we were from, etc..  The restaurant itself is very nice - very comfortable setting with a beautiful natural landscape in the center and nicely spaced tables.  After sitting we waited a while again for the menu and water service, which in Europe I am OK with, but for a place like this it is not acceptable.  These are little things, but definitely not what is expected for a restaurant at this level.  We were at Disfrutar a few nights earlier and the service was exceptional and they made a real effort to appreciate that you were at their establishment.    As far as the menu goes we opted for the short menu - our mistake - if you do go be sure to get the longer experience because the timing isn't much longer and some key dishes are missing from the short menu - especially the desserts.  The food was good but nothing was exceptional.  Execution and quality of the ingredients is what you would expect, but nothing was good enough to talk to your friends about.  In fact, the main meat dish, which was a take on a beef Wellington, but used poultry elements was just not good and not incredibly original.  The ratio of the dough to the filling was off so there was more crust than needed and not a very tasty execution of the proteins.    The biggest letdown was the desserts, the primary reason we came, which were very average.  The first dish was an ensemble made from sheep's milk - this was pretty good and had a cone that had the scent of a sheep which made it kind of fun.  The next dish was confusing.  It was supposed to be a take on the memories from reading books, I think, where the aroma is supposed to based on the smell of old books.  We were given a splash of oil on the hands that was supposed to be this scent, which you licked before embarking on eating the dish.  The dish was not interesting and did not provide any sort of continuity both in flavor or texture and did not seem to align with the theme that was explained to us.  The dish also did not go well with the first dessert because both desserts were pretty heavy milk based recipes.  Finally - in fear of sounding pretentious, when I went to go to the restrooms I was super confused on where they were so I walked back and forth across the mirrored walls looking for the door, which ended my night in a similar way that it started - awkward...  Most Michelin restaurants walk you to the restrooms and ensure that you know your way around.  Our opinion is that El Celler de Can Roca is at a Michelin level but definitely not worth a special trip nor did the service or food stand out as anything special.

2024-05-04,Greg T,"We've tried for two years to get a booking as we've lost out to the bots, so we had high hopes for our one-year wedding anniversary dinner after staying up until midnight to get this booking (we got married near Girona, so this place had a lot of meaning.) We also chose to have our wedding dessert from rocambolesc last year so this restaurant meant so much to us. We actually told the staff this, and they didn't care at all!!!!. The last 3 Michelin-starred restaurant we ate at was HÉLÈNE DARROZE last month, and wow, did they bring out all the stops!!! (they made a special newspaper for us and as soon as we entered they told us how grateful they were to choose them to celebrate our lunch with them. From the moment we entered their restaurant, we were made to feel so special. At el celler de can rocca, however,  no one was made to feel special that we could see, especially us! . We chose to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary here, and we truly regret this decision. We had even said before we would bring our wedding party back here for our ten years - sadly, we wouldn't even come back for petit fours.   When you choose to save and spend your hard-earned money at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant, which is at least £1000 for a couple, you would hope that you at least get greeted well. They couldn't even find out booking initially!   The food, in all honesty, was pretty boring, void of fun and personality, and everything had a foam or emulsion that tasted the same.  I've never felt the need to say something in a place like this, but I was so frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. When I excused myself and asked to speak to someone, I was met with excuses of how they were going to bring out a dessert for us. However, it was a little too late. The effort should have been made from the moment we arrived. I appreciated the apology, but it wasn't really heart felt.   This restaurant has no business holding three Michelin stars! That extra star is reserved for the wonderful restaurants that go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and appreciated.   I had hoped something special would happen at the end the meal to make up for the truly poor experience but it did not manifest.   take your money elsewhere to restaurants that do not rely on reputation.    A real, real, really wasted evening!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r949511572-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2023-08-08,melandashfoodies,"Sorry for my belated review, I am playing catch up. Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.  It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.  The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me,  having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more  theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine!   The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.  A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r908812594-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2023-08-02,James T,"This is everything you'd expect from a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars.  The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre.  The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.  We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience.""  We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours.  A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink.  The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.  Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.  I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.  The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.  Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything.  It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc).  The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.  The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.  A truly memorable experience highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r907384675-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment.

2023-07-06,Joanne P,"We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines).  There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch.   Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post'  - put in my bag for later disposal).  There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac,  the langostine and the caramelised apricot.  Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r900948718-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2023-06-14,Oscar,"Service/Decor: The restaurant is beautiful—modern, clean, and simply decorated without being sterile, the decor and natural lighting makes the place warm and inviting. The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.  Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.  Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.

2022-12-19,Sarosh K,"As a disciple of gastronomy, i found myself last Saturday in Girona, a delightful cobblestoned medieval town a couple of hours north of Barcelona, the site of celebrated 3 Michelin El Celler de Can Roca, the brainchild of the famed Brothers Roca.   I found later that Girona, dating back to pre-Roman empire times, is not only a cycling Mecca, the favorite training base of multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, but also the backdrop for many scenes of the popular TV series Game of Thrones. Picturesque and dramatic it certainly is.   A few years earlier, i had been fortunate enough to have persuaded the chef at 2 Michelin star Dani Maison on the island of Ischia, near Napoles, to open the restaurant for lunch specially for my party of 8, since all dinner reservations had been spoken for many months ago, for the entire week i had been scheduled to be in the area, with none of the cancellations we had been hoping for.   After we explained the situation and begged (piteously!) several times, the chef had been gracious enough to round up his crew and accommodate us. It was simply the best meal of my life, especially memorable since i make it a point to experience as many Michelin restaurants as i can during my travels.   We had been sailing the Amalfi Coast, a week of Michelin delight, stopping in at the various coastal towns and villages: to name a few, Capri, Positano, Sorrento and other equally impossibly beautiful and romantic medieval towns, setting our sailing schedule to match the reservations we had been able to procure.  A 3 Michelin meal is supposedly particularly worth making a special trip for. So, it was with great hope and anticipation that we made a transcontinental trip to Barcelona, and then a couple hours north, deep into the separatist province of Catalunya, on the Iberian peninsula, for El Celler de Can Roca.   My niece Gayatri had somehow managed a snag a reservation for 715pm for this date, due to a cancellation some months prior. So my travel plans were built around this reservation.   The entrance to the restaurant is dramatic, as the backlit ivy-covered passage walls suddenly open onto a large outdoor seating courtyard visible from the angled floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Since it is winter, and temperatures are quite cold, there were no patrons outdoors, but it must be quite pleasant in warmer times.   As we entered the restaurant, we found one of the well-coiffed brothers Roca industriously signing the flyleaf of a pile of books on the counter. It appears there is a whole section of coffee table books devoted to recipes and descriptions of the meal we were about to experience. Our salivary glands quivered!  While expensive (prix fixe 270 €) that’s not excessive for 12 courses following 16 appetizers. I had skipped lunch, in anticipation! But it is definitively caloric overkill, while visually and creatively impressive.  We were  informed by the proud waiter that no fewer than 400 fresh organic local ingredients had been used to prepare a specially curated vegetarian meal.   The venue, service, technical expertise and presentation were impeccable, but i  found the taste itself bland, insipid, unidimensional and uninspired, with many sauces and textures indistinguishable from each other,  a real letdown and disappointment. Oh, well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r872257048-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

The traditional fried bee hoon was delish too, so basic, so simple but yummy, using their local bee hoon that's more bouncy in texture. The dessert was also interesting, first time having grass jelly in pure liquid form instead of the solidified jelly and to have it with crushed peanuts added a different dimension.

2019-10-08,Zebregrey,"The only thing that’s good about this restaurant is they have used a good designer to build their website as everything looks and sounds so wonderful in it. This was the reason I went without seeing any reviews in order to stay neutral. The first impression on arrival I was impressed by the build and its grand entrance. The food arrived with lovely presentation for our eyes but from there all went downhill. Taste was incredibly blend, we all had to dip into their accompanying sauces for flavor.

Even if it was cheap I would have been disappointed.   Bad decor, dirty floor, no flavor, very, VERY bland food.

For those who don't mind spending more for an authentic Taiwanese dining experience, reserve a table at Mountain and Sea House Restaurant.

If you're really hungry, add one of their specialty dishes.  You have to order these in advance because they may take more than a day to prepare.

I love the private room on the ground floor. It can seat 14 guests with its own garden (ideal for guests who smoke). It's great for family gathering and friends visiting from overseas.   Of course it's not cheap. But you get what you pay for, right? Once in awhile it's alright to splurge and indulge! Reservation is a must if you wish to book the private room. The food presentation is very elegant, fitting to go with the ambience. It can serve meat lovers as well as vegetarians. Certain dishes have to be ordered in advance. If you like seafood, there's a live seafood tank where you can choose and pick the ones you like and how you want it to be cooked.

2016-11-09,Ambrosiameister,"Perhaps this is a restaurant better suited for families and bigger parties so that the chef is incentivized to cook a better meal. Decor is quaint but the food is really terrible. First of all, they charge NT150 per person for water, not sparkling water, just water, even just hot water. We were only 2 so could not order many dishes. I ordered their abalone (NT 380 for one tiny abalone) which had the stale taste of something that has been kept in the fridge for a while. In any case, the strong peppery taste was totally unsuitable for an abalone. Then came the most horrible dish of a fried ""dumpling"" with oyster and pork stuffing. From the menu, you would have thought that there was one oyster inside the dough but there were literally 2 small pieces of chopped oyster and 1 tiny slither of pork. Most disappointing was the dough which tasted of old flour. We just could not eat the dough it tasted so bad. We had a dish of ""organic"" vegetables so full of fried garlic, you could not taste the freshness of the vegetables. Finally, the dish of fried rice vermicelli tasted so common, any street vendor could have done better and frankly at NT 500, one would have expected more. In addition, we waited for 45 minutes before we had anything to eat. There was no coordination in how the dishes arrived. After the long wait, we were served the vegetables, nothing else. Then it was another 15 minute wait for the fried oyster dumplings, followed by another 10 minute wait for the vermicelli. We were told that since everything was ""freshly"" made, waiting time was long. I do not mind the waiting time if the food was any good but to wait such a long time for bad food was so frustrating when there is such an abundance of excellent food in Taipei for a lot less. The bill came to a bit more than NT 2000 for 2 people for one abalone, one dish of common vegetables, fried rice vermicelli and dumplings with stale tasting dough which we could not eat. Having read all the excellent reviews, I am still wondering what has gone wrong that evening.

2016-03-12,DineAboutWorld,My chef friend took me there with much anticipation as he seldom lets me down.  But what a joke of a place...first sign was the steep prices in a town where great food is very reasonable.  The Royal platter appetizers were highly recommended at NT1900 but I nibbled on a few pieces as most of it awful.  Most of the fat in the plate selection were made of white un-rendered  fat and almost all with no seasoning and flavor.  Some of the supposedly local food inspired creations were 10X street food prices and tasted 10X worse.  The chive turnovers were so freezer burned that is tasted and looked like something you might venture had you not eaten in weeks.  The grouper type fish (they didn't know) on ice (buried in ice actually as no live fish were in the fancy tanks) was suggested steamed but I knew it was going to be bad and if was...flesh was damaged by the ice temp and you can't property steam a fish 120NT/Lian (100g) so $60 fish ruined.   Also the chef likes to put cilantro ruffs on every dish...like bad Chinese restaurants in the US.  Why?  It was even on the steam fish instead of spring onion julienne which traditionally burst with sizzling oil.  There were even basic technical faults like seeds of cucumber in julienne base as they didn't even core out the cucumber.  Service was trained to pretend you are Ina nice villa but no one asked us why we left so much food uneaten.  Also they list a Brunello as a Cab blend...at outrageous prices with no vintages.  Three of us spent 12000NT and that my friend...that is a true rip-off!  Avoid unless you are easily impressed with nice faux villa looks and don't know your food & wine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13808671-d6674788-r354790413-Mountain_and_Sea_House-Zhongshan_District_Taipei.html,1,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

Unfortunately, our expectations were not fulfilled at all: We were informed that we had exactly 2 hours to eat in this Michelin-starred restaurant. When we arrived at 5:45 p.m., there was a sign at the door asking us to wait outside, which is not exactly pleasant in autumn temperatures. Once we were let in (5:55 p.m.), we ordered the 4-course menu. We were asked each time whether we liked it, and we answered ""too sour, too raw, just not an explosion of flavor, just not savoureux."" In response to our criticism, we were brought an additional course without asking us whether we wanted it. Unfortunately, this one wasn't great either, although it was a little better than the others. At least the dessert was good and met our expectations. We have to admit, we have traveled a lot around the world, spend a lot of money on eating out and have been to a few vegan/vegetarian restaurants, but we didn't understand Kle's cuisine.

2023-07-25,Food lover,"It was our third visit in the last two years. We arrived with memories of very tasty food, but also of slow service. We hoped to see improvement on that front, but unfortunately, our experience did not start or end well.  We waited for an amuse-bouche for almost 40 minutes, which was quite long, and we had expected quicker service. The first appetizer was served after another half hour, and the waiting time between meals remained long throughout the diner. It was at least twice the time that would be acceptable. After more than three hours, I mentioned the issue to the (otherwise very pleasant and friendly) waiters, but it had no effect on the pace of service. It took us over 5 hours to complete the 11-course meal. Moreover, the lack of air conditioning made the environment very hot, especially during a hot summer day.  While I thought the food was nice, I would definitely not repeat the experience again. I discreetly emailed my comments to the restaurant the next day, and I received a reply after two weeks. They apologized and mentioned delayed reconstructions, and they expressed hope that we would be fully satisfied next time. Bad excuse, because no one mentioned anyting during our reservation, upon arrival or when paying the bill. Not to mention that this was our third ‘slow’ experience, and that portable air conditioners are now sold at a lower price than the cost of a single dinner.   However, after careful discussion with other guests who were also present, we decided that three opportunities were enough. A Michelin-starred restaurant should provide a full service experience, not just good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r905563585-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2023-01-23,Ernest Novak,"The cold and sparse reception did not make an impression.  No explanation about the food.  That's something.  Freshwater fish are offered as sea fish.  Poor selection of wines by the glass for such an expensive restaurant.  Describing tannins in white wine (?!) is almost alarming.  Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.  The fish was tasteless, too greasy, practically inedible in the unfortunate combination.  The only positive thing was a really nice and good dessert, and of course the beautiful white landscape.

I liked the dishes I ate in September slightly more than this time, but you have to know they use only homegrown, local, and foraged foods which vary throughout the seasons.

2022-03-25,Ales 924,"I heard it used to be a nice and good restaurant. Good inns are often hidden in remote locations - this is NOT the case here. The house is nothing special from the outside, nor is it inside, but it is poorly heated space - maybe they don't have firewood?!. The 3.5-hour time consuming food service consists of surrealistically small portions with a quasi-artistic touch and a high price. The “Michelin star” is vulgarly exploited to find the upper limit of guests ’naivety & stupidity. It all looks like a bad joke. To be able to separate the dish from the decoration, the staff constantly explains the composition of the miniature food brought on small pedestals. I also saw the head chef at the next table, he was quite a big guy - I thought - he probably eats somewhere else. The wine is good but nothing special.  CONCLUSION: this is not a restaurant, this is a very expensive and time consuming tasting of miniature portions of edible dishes ...

This last visit disappointed us so much, the restaurant sadly decided to minimize their portions and also the atmosphere changed.  Plates in summer 2021, post second covid lockdown, aren’t what they were in 2020 or even before. I would estimate they are 3 times smaller now!  We’ve been offered 2 pieces of bread throughout the evening, which is borderline insulting, the staff didn’t ask - not even once - if we are satisfied with the food, not even at the end when we left.  Food was mediocre, but most of all - it was tiny. 7 tiny plates for 60 euros, every plate consisted of maximum 2 bites with the main course being a joke. A small piece of fish.  So hungry now we are going for a take out, after spending 150 euros for nothing - a few bites!!  It’s sad to see what happened with this restaurant and sadly none of my family or friends will be returning.  Im not sure if saving money by minimizing the portions was worth it.

Service was good, providing also detailed information on dishes, rhytm of service just as one would expect in a high level restaurant. Quite elaborate sommelier's recommendations with menus. Wine list reather unorthodox, covering well Slovenia and Collio (emphasis on orange wines), a connoisseur might miss some essential foreign entries. Elegant plates, completely different for each dish, proper glasses. I liked the food the first time, it now got even better and more sparkingly creative. The two five course menus are both excellent and well worth their price considering a wide range of amuse bouche and petit fours servings. Seasonality rules.

2024-10-06,TheTonyTraveller,This is exactly what you expect which is good. It does steak and that’s about it - except for sausage for starters - there are sides including veg and salads - mashed potato favoured by many and the ubiquitous French fries.  Long wine list with excellent choice.   Wonderful greeting just outside the front with a  glass of sparking. Attentive helpful staff. A very classy slick operation that feels personal.   Highly recommended - and compared to London prices highly highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r972769106-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2024-09-20,WanderingOttersons,"This place comes as a VERY highly rated option on the restaurant scene.  From the moment we arrived, I began to wonder.  We showed up a little ahead of time for our reservation and they seemed very confused and disorganized.  We had to wait more than 10 minutes past our reservation to be seated, standing awkwardly outside with the smokers.  The service was good.  Not quite what I was hoping based on the expectations.  The starters were excellent, the meals were good.  Yes, you are going to get a good steak here.  You can do that in MANY places in this country, though.  The prices you pay are not returned with a higher value or quality meal from our experience.  We had multiple meals at a nearby steak restaurant that were superior to this and MUCH cheaper.  I'd say, find another option.  It wasn't worth the hype for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r970609335-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2024-08-19,lfz,"First off, service is outstanding! They welcome you with a glass of white sparkling wine and a empanada before you are seated. We sat at an outside table, and even though it was around 14 celsius outside, they had a lot of warmers and blankets.  We ordered a traditional provoleta and they brought a chorizo too (for free). This appetizers were very good, not to out of the ordinary but very good still. Then, we ordered an ojo de bife (ribeye) and a cuadril de bife with a side of mashed potatoes with trouffle shavings and a side of Brussel sprouts. Meat was excellent, maybe the ribeye was a little bit dry but that is just expected from the cut, but the flavor was intensely good. The sides were way out of the ordinary, they were delicious, specially the Brussel sprouts (ordering this is a must).  After a meal made for the gods, we ordered some ice cream for dessert and they brought three flavors, two of which were free (they apparently liked us very much). We had the dulce de leche, samboyan and milk ice cream covered with hot chocolate. The three were very good, I have tried some dulce de leche ice creams that are a little better but the other two were out of this world!  In regards of price, we ordered a lot of food with the outstanding service of the waiters and it was only $60 each including drinks.

2024-07-31,wernerlin,"Before going to Don Julio, I read with some concern the varying reviews, but, thankfully, in the end our meal was wonderful from start to finish, a truly memorable evening. As there has already been a ton of prose written about Don Julio, I’ll bullet point key observations:  - Reservations: You absolutely need to get a reservation way in advance. As soon as you know you’ll be going to Buenos Aires, go to Don Julio’s website and try to book a reservation. Even if it’s before the roughly 80 days when you can actually reserve the table, you can/should enter your e-mail address to be notified when reservations open up for your desired date/time - this is called a early-access request. Then, when you get the e-mail notifying you that reservations are open for your requested date/time (“Convert your early-access request into a reservation”), immediately go and book a table. But it doesn’t end there - you will get two additional e-mails as your reservation approaches, one to confirm, and then another to confirm again and enter a credit card in case you are a no-show. Obviously, keep an eye out for those in your inbox and respond promptly. - Arriving: Arrive a few minutes early and expect that you will wait in line to check in for your reservation - for our opening 7p reservation, we waited maybe 7 minutes in line to get to the receptionist. Happily, every now and then a waiter will come by and offer a complimentary glass of spumanti (a carbonated wine drink, like champagne but a bit sweet) to make the time go by faster.  - Ordering: If you’re not sure about which steak to order, ask your server to take you up to the central open grill where the different cuts are laid out, to show you what’s what. - Dining: Note that the steaks tend to be lightly salted, at least compared to the sodium-heavy US standard. We found that adding a nice pinch of salt, thoughtfully provided as a matter of course in a small bowl alongside criollo and chimichurri, really brought out the amazing quality of the beef. I might be wrong, but I suspect some of the other reviews mentioning lackluster flavor was due to the lighter salting. - Service: Our waiter was super friendly and responded enthusiastically to any request we had, like additional oil for our bread, adjusting the table, etc. Just be aware that the service can be more akin to the Argentinian style, where they consider it rude to pester or rush you, so if you want anything, e.g. another glass of wine or the check at the end of the meal, just get your server’s attention and politely ask. Unlike the US, they won’t constantly check on you and then plop a check on your table to turn it over ASAP.    Is it pricey compared to other parrillas in Buenos Aires? Absolutely, though it’s only mid to upper-range by New York standards. Does it cater to tourists? Yes, at least based on the clientele when we visited. Really, though, the bottom line is that our dinner was the one of the best experiences we’ve had dining out. The lovely ambiance, the amazing food, the thoughtful little extras like the spumanti, and the top-notch service made it a lovely night to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r962621384-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2022-11-13,Lois131313,Restaurant about 15 mins out of Chiavenna on your way to Switzerland. Very nice decor and the views from the room are on the nature all around. Very nice styling and decorations with a large fire at one end with a warm feel but modern. The food was simply excellent and the presentation was amazing. One of the main positive points was that at the same table we could have 2 different gourmet menus. This is very unusual and a huge plus for this restaurant. The food was really excellent - I had the Autumn menu and my husband the gourmet menù. The food was innovative in putting together so many tastes and cooking styles. Presentation was inspired and works of art. Really not sure we have eaten better with an exception of  a 3 star Michelin.

2019-02-14,Fabio B,"Lanterna Verde ( litterally Green Lantern ) is one of those restaurant that noboby crossing that aera of Nord Lombardy should miss. Particularly for those reaching Engadina Valley and St Moritz from the Italian border is a must to stop there for lunch or dinner. Lanterna Verde has one Michelin star sice one decade and I have never taste a wrong plate in so many visits I did. There are a couple of set menu , one based on the tradition the other with some innovation . the quality of the ingrediences is at the top and Nord valley Italy plates are the main receipts. The family running the restaurant by tradition they farm troutes in the cold waters coming from aroud and for those who wish to try this preciouse fresh water fish it a immense pleasure. The presentation of all plates is impeccable and the taste even more. Esquisit appetizer , classis rise and past and main course of great interest where game or particular cuts are always available top breake the monotony of red meet .Very seldom my appetite and taste is challenged to such satisfaction. When choosing wine you will be surprised by the number of labels available , better ask to the boss somelier who will advice you best with some few bottle production lebels impossible to find elsewhere. Most of top wines are there but trust me try some small producers reccomended by them. Price for 2 with good wine included is less than what you can spent in St Moritz for one person in an average place with non entusiastic food . This place deserve to be visited to the extend that even in vacation in Engadina it merit to be choosen for a night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r652386552-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2016-09-13,TheGlobalIndian,"We dinned at this beautiful restaurant based on recommendation given by my hotel at Lake Como. We drove an hour to reach this well located restaurant, and were served by Joanna. The food we tried here was awesome, and the staff was friendly only until the time we got our bill.  This restaurant is frequented by locals, and they don't have many tourists as guests, which is a good thing as you get authentic food, but on the other side they took tourist for a ride with their bill.  The prices in the menu were different from what they charged us in the bill. Example Pizzoccheri was priced at €14 in menu but was charged at €20 in the bill and Rissoto was priced at €18 in the menu but was charged to us at €24.   We asked what was their soup of the day, and we were told it was Mushroom soup, though a very beautiful soup, since the prices were not in the Menu for the soup, we assumed it would be priced similar to other appetizers in the menu. We were shocked to see €30 for a soup in the invoice.  I would say the food was very good. Given that its a very nice restaurant, good food, we won't have minded paying the prices they charged, but to be fair you cannot charge more than what you put out in your Menu card.   I did try asking Joanna about the Soup, and she said its because the mushrooms are high quality and hence the cost. For other items I didn't realise till the time I returned home and compared the prices in the bill with the prices on the menu published online on their website.  It was really shocking for us to see a restaurant with such great reputation would act so low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r418318198-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

In this recent visit we went there for diner instead and I was really disappointed.  Don't know if that has to do because there were only 3 tables for the whole evening. The nice elegant dining room was closed. We were all being sitted at the other side of a very un-cosy room with old fashion green colour wall paper and many old collection radios; with the radio on through out the whole diner. The lighing was really unsupportable.The chair was so uncomfortable, very hard without any cushion. The whole dining atomsphere were all ruined. We both have the Goutmet & Gourmand menu but the food was not as the past standard. I guess they do more affort for lunch because of people from Switzerland or businese people coming for lunch.

2014-12-30,Ezrail,"This is what Italy is famous for. From the moment you enter the restaurant (actually, even before, when you make a reservation), you're welcomed so warmly it immediately puts you in a perfect mood. The ambiance is warm and peaceful, the setting very comfortable, and there is plenty of space around your table not to feel crammed. A fireplace crackling is just the perfect touch. Large tables, wonderful white linens, elegant plates, cutlery and glasses, but yet simple enough to still make you feel at home and comfortable. The food is so carefully prepared, with fresh and beautiful ingredients, it blows you away. No half measures, the flavors are wonderful. Among other delights, we tasted some of the most outstanding pizzoccheri ever. Both authentic and refined, perfectly balanced. The cuisine in general is very refined, but without losing sight of the authentic flavors it is inspired by. From the perfect home-made fresh bread (absolutely wonderful), all the way through some of the most amazing sorbets, the food is just impeccable. The wine list is a treasure trove. They have an amazing selection of beautiful Italian wines (and a few French gems), but the prices are so competitive and honest you almost feel guilty. I have rarely seen such a good selection of Barolos and Barbarescos, of the perfect vintages and by the best producers, at such honest prices. A true gem. By the way, they do have the wines that appear on the list: I ordered one of my favorite Barbarescos, and there it came, at perfect cellar temperature, and so well kept the label was perfectly clean. Magnificent Riedel decanter, more than perfect Riedel glasses, impeccable service. About the service, it could not be better. Attentive and very friendly, but discrete and never overwhelming. The rhythm was perfect, with dishes served gracefully and timely. If only they got rid of the background music, gentle but not suitable for the perfect atmosphere, they would hit a home run. Not to be missed, and by the way, if you're on your way to Switzerland, your last chance for a truly wonderful meal before entering the ""land of sad food"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r246547132-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2024-09-20,CONSOLE067,"One of the best starred restaurants in Italy. We returned years later. Then at the helm of the kitchen was the uncle never forgotten, today instead the nephew but the result at the table remained excellent. Class, dedication, technique, elegance are the main ingredients of this starred cuisine, also convenient in value for money, which is rare nowadays. In the dining room, the chef's parents welcome guests and wisely dictate the timing of the service. We chose the four-course Valchiavenna menu (€ 75.00). Very interesting and fun the possibility to compose your own a la carte route by choosing individual courses from the different tasting menus. After the entrée, a delicious potato cream with trout eggs, olive cream, capers and fennel, we started the tasting path with the valley cold cuts with porcini mushroom in oil and dairy butter: bresaola, bacon, coppa and salami, all of excellent choice and quality. As a first course, the famous tajadin dulz de Villa, a kind of maltagliati or rags made from chestnut flour and white flour with cheese and chamomile aroma, well cooked and very tasty. Extraordinary is the second or veal shank cooked in hay brought to the table with the saucepan and of which we are explained the preparation that includes in the final moment even a very short flame with fire to give the dish that incredibly delicate and pleasant touch of smoked. As an accompaniment to the main course, the characteristic rustiment, a kind of pie made with polenta, potatoes, green beans and leek with incredible potato chip spaghetti on top. Well-kept, as indeed all the courses, the dessert: cherries, dark chocolate and fennel sorbet, basically a dark chocolate humus with fresh cherries underneath and ice cream-based cherry balls on top. Generous portions. The wine list is impressive, deep and with honest mark-ups. The arduous choice fell on a refined and structured Inferno della Valtellina Superiore ""La Cruus"" docg of 2018 14.5% of Mamete Prevostini, a pure Nebbiolo (€ 45.00). Pastries offered: cherry macarons, ugly but good with hazelnut and liquorice and mou candy. Haute cuisine experience and rewarding for a final bill of only € 209.00 (the two four-course Valchiavenna menus, wine, covered € 5.00 and water € 4.00).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r970565909-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

That is however precisely where this three-star restaurant is located. The philosophy behind it all, just as the fully zen private dining rooms with tatami mats - I assume - is the full and undivided focus should be on the dinner. And: it delivered. The food is season bound and, at times, surprising. While some of the dishes we had were ‘just’ great Japanese food, two of the twelve dishes we had were truly magnificent.   With respect to the  sake and wine pairing we had; the sake was lovely (as a non-sake expert) and we enjoyed the wine (although other Michelin star restaurants may certainly have better wines).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r946927058-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2019-09-22,O Tter,"I have developed the theory that very good restaurants are frequently divisive. There will be many diners that love a good restaurant and leave glowing reviews. Others will simply not like the concept and, having potentially paid a very great deal of money for an experience that did not hit the spot, will leave poor reviews. Looking at a couple of recent reviews for Kashiwaya, it seems that this is the case here.  For my part, this is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten in. As my son said, it would almost be worth the journey from London to Osaka simply to visit this restaurant. It is expensive but, equally, you get what you pay for.  As far as I could see, the restaurant comprises a collection of private dining rooms and we were shown to a delightful space upstairs. Decoration is traditional Japanese with cloth covered walls and a tatami mat floor. The table was close to the floor but was placed over a pit (for want of a better expression ) into which your legs went, so that you could sit very comfortably on the floor.  The service is superb with an amazing sense of ceremony. Each time we were visited, typically by two or three of the staff, the door was slid open and they bowed outside before making their way to the table to serve us. Two of the staff members spoke a fair to good level of English and were perfectly well able to explain the various different courses and sake.  The food is exceptional and fully deserving of three Michelin stars. Inevitably I enjoyed some course more than others but all were good. I especially like the 'moon' theme than ran through the dinner and inspired many of the courses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r711835114-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2019-05-22,Natakrit N.,"I went to this restaurant after another 3 stars restaurant Hajime, which I was very happy with. So I expected some surprising tastes and textures but it was a disappointment.  The food didn't worth a detour nor flying to dine here. The food tasted just like it looked. I mean raw fish tastes like raw fish but I expected them to do something with the ingredients and turned out to be something unexpected in terms  of flavors and textures. They tried to serve the best seasonal ingredients using Japanese cooking. No offense but you can imagine authentic Japanese cooking, which tend not to add much flavor to ingredients resulting in very mild flavor food, which I could have it elsewhere in Kyoto. I expected more than this from 3 stars Michelin and I know what kind restaurants to look for now. I love to be excited and surprised.   So if you want an above average authentic Japanese restaurant, this restaurant maybe for you but if you  are looking for something surprising, it's not for you. The decorations were like small old Japanese room and 2 small tables, which could only fit 2 persons and it was a little bit uncomfortable for me but I like how it's a private room. Also it's about 4,200 yen taxi drive from Namba.  The dish I enjoyed the most was in the attachments. It's called Mizumono - Fruit balls with honey jelly. It was a very fun dish with different flavors of peeled fruit balls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r675650495-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2018-10-17,JFenton1,"Of all the Michelin Star restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, this was the restaurant we were most excited about. I’m really bummed to have to write this review... On paper, 3 Michelin Stars, Relais Chateaux, $400 per person... It sounded like the meal of a lifetime, right? NOT. The restaurant has many rooms, most of which are tatami floor seating style. We were led to what looked like an interrogation room with a table large enough for 10 people, 2 Western chairs, no artwork on the walls and dated decor. Not even old charm Japanese, just old and frankly creepy. No music and the incessant sliding door opening and closing with a rusted metallic sound... We were totally creeped out. We had to start playing a little background music from our phones to get a some kind of atmosphere. Rude of us? Maybe, but I swear, the room had this awful fluorescent lighting, not at all the “cocoon feel” I had read about in the reviews.  THE FOOD: just plain boring. No flavors, nothing exciting at all. Is the Chef so well known that he keeps getting the ratings he received 20 years ago?  The sake/wine tasting at $90 per person consisted of $12 bottles anyone could find at the corner supermarket. Not good at all.  Service was lovely. Therefore my giving the place 2 stars.   We walked out of there, thanked everyone politely and burst into laughter once in the taxi. Never have I spent $900 on a meal for 2 that was so below average. Not to mention the restaurant is a 45 minute drive from the center of Osaka.   SO DISAPPOINTING.

2018-05-23,mike g,"in other words, this will be one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat. why? let me count the ways:  (1) the peaceful setting in a traditional tatami mat room (with a seat and room for legs below the just-above-floor-level table, for the less flexible or more long-legged among us) in a traditional house incongruously next to a freeway in an otherwise quiet mid-north osaka neighbourhood.  (2) the gracious and welcoming greeting on arrival - and, depending on how busy they are, possibly even from grand chef hideaki matsuo and/or his wife proprietress katsuko matsuo.  (3) the unobtrusive, professional yet empathetic service throughout the time at kashiwaya - in our case, for all four hours of our visit.

The food was nicely placed on utensils which became pieces of beautiful artwork.  I must mention the  wine pairing.

2018-04-03,Dag I,"Three star restaurants in Japan are always surprising. Either they are chock full of molecular experiments and nordic inspiration (from Noma), or they are very close to something like the traditional Keiseki. This is clearly in the latter category. Al guest are given private rooms, and all are served a set menu consisting of 12-14 courses. A drinking pairing consisting mostly of top notch sake is highly recommended. Tables are traditional in the low style, but there is room for legs underneath, so have no fear of sitting straight on the floor. The food is served at a calm pace, brought by three waiters in traditional dresses. Food is traditional, praising the spring and cherry blossoming when we were there, but with some interesting twists. The whole seance takes almost three hours, but gee how fast time passes.

2017-07-28,mike g,"“Hassun: Conger eel cooked in sake, pickled Japanese ginger, green taro stem, simmered octopus with jade cucumber with ginger vinegar and macrophyll oil [from a type of leaf found in ferns and seed plants], fresh urchin, squid stings, Japanese green leaves.” That was just one of the 12 courses on offer when I visited Osaka’s Kashiwaya, with its three Michelin stars. Japanese food is famous for its fascinating and healthy variety. And nowhere is this more evident than at Kashiwaya. So hearing the backstory about a restaurant and its food can really enhance the dining experience. Hideaki Matsuo, 53, Proprietor and Grand Chef, and his wife Katsuko, Proprietress, earned their third Michelin star in 2011. They opened a sister restaurant in Hong Kong in 2015 and by last year it had already received its first Michelin star. One of the signature dishes is “fluffy” melt-in-your-mouth lobster. Chef Matsuo uses the shell in the broth and steams it for a long time. It took him six hours to come up with this dish, from inspiration to completion.  He develops dishes according to the seasons and also tradition. For example, with the approach of a hot summer, in old times the Japanese emperor gave away ice to his subjects to beat the summer heat and wish them good health. So when summer approaches Kashiwaya serves dishes that reflect this tradition with, for example, the appearance of ice. Unsurprisingly Matsuo is both head chef at the restaurant and also head chef at home, where he likes to prepare everyday food that’s quick and easy to cook.  He often chooses dishes his mother made – and takes photos of them to send her to show he still cooks what she made for the family. His favourite food? Fried prawns.  When friends invite the couple for a meal, even if it’s basic food what matters to them are the fresh ingredients and preparation, the intention to provide a good meal. Even if the food happens to be bad, Matsuo said he has been taught never to leave anything on the plate. At Kashiwaya, guests also never leave anything on their plates. But for all the right reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r506612572-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

And there it appears , a few minutes later . The smiles and courtesy of the few Japanese girls serving you are unbeatable.  The first course will melt you already , not quite because of the taste , texture and material used , but also due to the artistic presentation .  What comes afterwards convince you that Michelin doesn't give 3 stars easily and your taste buds and eyes are constantly entertained to the utmost .  A dish with jelly and shrimps inside was actually outshone by the arrangement and the color of the food as well as the design of the ceramics . The whole presentation glows and one keeps on wondering how so much time and effort have been spent on just one dish .   The overall price ( without counting the sake ) is around Yen 25000, a most reasonable amount when one considers that the ambience , service , food , arrangement and effort put into the show are superb .

We have never had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant so thought we would take the opportunity and visit.  From our arrival being met at the bottom of the stairs, we were treated like long lost best friends, very spoiled and very loved :) The food was sensational and the service was spectacular. We booked a table at the open kitchen bench which was fab so we chatted to Chef Jimmy all the way through every course.

2023-12-25,Michael U,"Recently reopened after an extensive renovation PRU focuses on ""community-to- fork"" gastronomy from Chef Jimmy Ophorst, a location just steps from Phuket's most exclusive resort affording visitors a luxury experience previously unavailable in the area.  An acronym for “Plant. Raise. Understand.,” Jimmy and his team going to great lengths in explaining why Ingredients are chosen and how they are showcased, guests are welcomed in the lobby where Thai Sparkling Wine begins a progressive tasting that soon proceeds to a fully open kitchen.   A short ride from Phuket’s top Resorts, nearby Trisara playing host to a modern building with on-site gardens, it is in the lobby that diners nibble on small bites including a Kimchi Pancake before taking a front and center seat in front of chefs that are friendly and engaging.  Truly a celebration of Thailand’s bounty, Ophorst willfully choosing unique ingredients, course one places Durian amidst Shiso and Caviar with spectacular results before moving onward to a slice of Giant Travelly perfumed by  Ceylon Oak that grow 50 meters above the ground.  Obtaining many ingredients from co-owned PRU Jampa Farm, 1.6 hectares of organic soil available for tours, Bread arrives with too much (IE just enough) local Butter prior to Black Crab Curry given complexity by Tea and a Fennel Bulb baked in Pastry atop Sauce bolstered by Vanilla.  A bold and concise sort of cuisine, no extraneous additions but every dish an expression of the Chef with faultless cooking, Coral Grouper is perhaps the most straight-forward presentation of the night – especially in comparison to Squid in Blue Cheese with laminated Rolls to sop up the excess.   Finishing savories with rosy Duck Breast in a peppered Sauce as complex as Mole it is by way of Guava Granita heated by Pepper that the palate is cleansed en route to Banana with Salted Plum and Citrus.  Back to the lounge to finish, four Mignardises followed by Coffee and Chocolates, PRU may only currently hold 1* from Michelin but the cooking achieves at a 2* level with 3* aspirations and the means to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r930987554-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

Seeing a kitchen in action at that level is absolutely fascinating. The chef, souschef and entourage explained every dish and its (sometimes unuasal) ingredients.

2023-07-22,Susi Russell-Park,"We dined at PRU last night. We had a cocktail in the bar prior to dinner made by Tus, which was amazing then we had the 5 course tasting menu with premium wine pairing. The service was impeccable especially Alfredo, Chalong and Pla. The food was incredible, very intricate and we enjoyed most of the dishes. There was an amuse bouche that wasn't to my taste at all but that is personal taste nothing to do with quality!  I was beyond amazed and grateful how they catered for myself being allergic to gluten. My dishes were created the same as my husband and super impressive and that is a rarity! You just need to allow the team 48hrs notice to cater for gluten free.  We were also informed on booking regards the dress code 'resort chic' and states no swimwear or flip flops, so we were very disappointed when the table we had to look at all night in front of us had been allowed into the restaurant in beach wear - swim shorts, t-shirt and reef shoes!!! Not what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant at all, cheapens the experience and disappointing that the team did not refuse the guests to enter and enforce their dress code.  We would also feedback that the wine pairing was great but we would have liked the sommelier to elaborate on why each wine was paired with the dishes to give a more detailed and elevated experience.

2023-05-27,nak_lang,"Went last night with a friend and did the 7 courses.  Really happy with it. It may possibly be the best dinner I have ever had.  The asian ingredients were fused seamlessly with western ideas and ingredients. There were nice suprises like 2 amuses before the dinner. A little bag of treats to take home. Interesting bread and butters and a complex palette cleanser towards the end. The portion sizes were pretty good. Our booking was at 7pm and we both had a dish at around 3pm before going so by the end of it we were both happy. If we didn't have the 3pm dish and hung out all day I imagine we would have left a bit hungry. However, in my view it's an experience you are going for, not a big feed. I think if we just opted for the 5 courses it may have perhaps felt a little too light. I would recommend the 7 course. The dishes were all incredibly intricate. I have eaten and worked in michelin starred kitchens in the past and even compared to my past experiences this was very very detailed and intricate food.  I had to put my glasses on to see all the components so I can't imagine trying to plate these up. The flavours and textures were pretty good. I particularly liked how they infused the pea tart with a BBQ flavour. It was phenomenal but I do have some feedback. My friend commented the butters were lacklustre. They wern't bad but I felt the tamarind butter was a little underwhelming and the salted butter tasted like Anchor with salt on top. Could be improved. The main thing was the descriptions. We are both Chefs and do the dinner for a bit of inspiration as well and like to really analyze everything and understand what each component is.  I get the short menu descriptions. I don't particularly like long old school descriptions either. The staff explained each dish pretty well but even asking them to repeat sometimes it is hard to understand and we didn't want to be throwing 20 questions for every dish. I imagine we understood about 70% of what we were eating and a person that's not a Chef probably like 40 or 50%. Maybe a more detailed menu available on request I don't know. Other minor thing was odd questions before the dinner on the phone and during the dinner. ""What hotel are you staying at"". ""Did you come by car or"". Happy to answer. I'm not a secret agent but would be nice to know why they need this information. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed but that's another area they could really do something cool and improve with.  Service for the most part was great. They had a good knowledge of the food they were serving and English was pretty good just a few words we got lost with.  Anyway overall it was a lovely dinner. Total cost for 2 people 7 courses and a few random drinks each was around 20,000 baht.  Certainly worth it if you appreciate the food but if you don't appreciate the food then I wouldn't bother spending so much on a dinner. Look forward to returning in the future if they ever have a new menu to try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r892171354-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

I have always asked myself if I really need Michelin starred restaurants in Phuket where there is so much food readily available everywhere you turn and the answer is simple, yes you do. Of course you do! Phuket is developing fast and it's only right that Pru is rated so highly. From the start, you know that you are in for something special, the welcome is genuine and the service, food and the location are all spot on.  Special occasion location at prices that are very easy to achieve if you like to eat in Singapore!

Concept, services, and presentations are similar to French Laundry in Napa Valley, California; but honestly, not even closed!  Food taste with lack of convictions why they taste the way they should, I find the food as though the chefs wanted to create a highly complexed of inventing Thai food to international discoveries. Sorry to say, I think most of the dishes failed miserably as such!  I remember the time we visited French Laundry several years ago, some of dishes I had I wanted them to linger in my mouth forever. PRU’s creations were far from the mighty sensations.  Service was great, the verbal presentation of both food and wine paring were confusing.  Price  was expensive, at $400 per person for 7 - course meal including wine parring, it wasn’t closed to “wonderfully delicious”.  Wine parring choices were a bit of second or third grade comparing to Napa Valley or French wines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r825904549-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

We did the 7 course meal with wine pairing and added on the caviar supplement offered. The meal itself included way more than 7 courses - 3 bites as an amuse-bouche, various breads and butters, a beautiful cheese selection of cheeses from all over Thailand (creamy, blue, goat, etc) with jam and honey, a small “pre dessert” of Phuket pineapple and ice cream, and a final tasting of multiple different desserts aside from what was included on the menu.   The duck was amazing. The sauces on the grouper were delicious. My favorite dish (which is hard to choose) was the red mullet with black garlic - had a crispy sour dough crust with delicious sauces.   We left full and incredibly happy - even with a little bag of goodies from the chef! Pricing is on par for a higher end Michelin star restaurant..might even be a tad cheaper than some.

2021-10-25,MGAZH,"After 3 years we went to eat again during our Trisara stay at the Pru. The result was the same as last time: it's pretty good, but nothing special.  In addition the following:  It is fantastic that all the products that are served here come from Thailand and that the cuisine can be described as extremely sustainable.  The products are all very good, the combinations in the dishes are sometimes very good and sometimes not so good. So it was more of a mixed experience. But that's just a matter of taste.  But the following has bothered us: if they commit themselves to sustainability, but at the same time they serve water from Italy, it is more than irritating. If I want to eat sustainably and do this with Thai products, I don't want to drink water that was transported 10,000 km here. This is ecological nonsense. We therefore only ordered good Thai water.  Given the very high prices, one can expect a sommelier to be on hand to advise. that is not the case here.  The staff are very difficult to understand, their English is not too good. But the staff is extremely friendly, that has to be said.  The Thai cheese is extremely good, really. With a view to sustainability, it is very strange that the morning buffet at Trisara serves only imported cheese - I would prefer much the Thai cheese!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r815984790-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

The food and the experience is as good as the narrative of PRU story - i e what the chef wants to tell us both conceptually but also in every taste created. I went for the 7-course menu, which was not too much at all considering the portion of each course (not a complain). Clearly this is an European style cuisine but definitely inspired by Thai A LOT, for which I enjoyed it very much. Overall I would recommend this however if i can be a bit picky: 2 things didnt work out well for me. 1) the perfume smell of the restaurant and the oshibori/wet towel was too strong till a point I felt bit distracted and annoyed. 2) I would recommend the dish of the wild mushroom can be served later as the taste and smell was fairly strong, which was carried over to my taste for the subsequent course (despite I drank a whole class of water!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r801917299-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2021-07-31,K Wang,"The experience at PRU is great! The food itself isn't the best that I have ever tried, but the service is impeccable and they try hard to live up with their brand on sustainability and connection with ingredients.  As a vegetarian, I always appreciate it that the restaurant can have a dedicated vegetarian menu to ""normalize"" our status instead of just making us trouble makers with special dietary requirement. PRU is doing good with it. :) Before the meal begins, the view outside the restaurant was already a feast to the eye! They also pulled out a special box of ingredients to give a preview on what I will be eating. What I would suggest is that they make a nice e-brochure and attach a QR code with the presentation box so that interested audience can check out more details online. I ordered the vegetarian menu with non-alchoholic drinks for food pairing. The juices come along with the dishes are interesting gem themselves. Too bad that they did not come onto the menu too.  The food came in 5 dishes, plus a P.R.U. signature appetizer, bread to begin with, cheese tasting, pre-dessert, and lastly tea with condiments. I later found out that the cheese and tea came with additional price only when I paid the bill. I don't have a problem with that but they should have told me in advance.   I was a bit surprised when they served bread at the beginning and in fact there is so much food to come. Given the price of the dinner, the bread was definitely the most expensive artisan bread I have ever tried. I was a bit hungry after the ""main dish"" but the ""cheese tasting"" later made me totally full! The waiter introduced various cheese produced in Thailand and I had the chance to taste them all - definitely a dream came true for a cheese lover! The soft ones made from goat cheese were stronger than I would have thought, but I prefer them to the cow cheese ones. At the end when I left, there was also a souvenir of two bottle of jams but I have not tasted them. The hand-written card was sweet too. Overall I think the food was great and all staff endeavored to make it a great experience beyond tastes.

The service is fine, it's about what you'd expect at that price point, but not beyond. Don't go in expecting fun surprises, but your water glass will remain full and your napkin will (usually) be replaced when you get up and go to the bathroom. The food is so jaw-droppingly unremarkable you'll wonder if someone is playing a trick on you. I just finished dining there, and this was the big occasion dining experience of my honeymoon, and no joke the best things I had tonight were some broth and a nice little bite of brown butter ice cream. That's not acceptable at a such a price point. Do I regret going to Maaemo? Obviously, but at the same time, it was kind of funny and inspiring. It makes me want to work harder and now I'm quite certain that if I spent a few months preparing, I too could make a Michelin quality meal.

2024-08-24,Amstraveler,"The hardest lunch choice is what to drink.  I’m normally a fan of pairing wines and Maaemo does what I really like and offers three different quality packages (at three different price levels).  But buying wine in Norway is a bit overextravagant under any circumstances - the NOK 16000 ‘Holy Grail’ pairing, while it would undoubtedly have been divine, was no exception.  Many guests limited themselves to water but we went for a juice pairing which was an unexpected delight.  Mixtures like cherry juice with a hint of nettle and toasted hazelnut were surprisingly successful (especially when pairing a dish with hazelnut in the sauce) - I’ll have a go at making some of the mixtures myself now.  Food (in the 14 courses) mostly superb, some merely very good.  For me the starters and main courses beat the desserts (three ice cream dishes perhaps one too many) with the signature oyster/mussel and king crab/reindeer combos as highlights. Coffee weak. Unlimited water.  Ambience superb, service formal and a little subdued but extremely attentive, around 10 tables each of 1 or 2 people when we were there.  Amusingly we sat next to one gentleman whose vacations consisted mostly of visiting the world’s best restaurants (and told everyone in earshot about his visits).  He felt the restaurant lacked a star performer on the service team (maitre d’ or whatever) which was to him essential in a top restaurant.  Maaemo indeed works with a flat org structure front of house so for someone to whom a star performer out front is critical to their enjoyment - well go elsewhere or forget your prejudice and just enjoy the dishes.  No background music until the last couple of dishes were served.  Prices as advertised - very high; but that’s Norway for you.  Watch out when reservations open - I tried for supper the day of our visit and the restaurant was fully booked half an hour before reservations were supposed to open. Lunch was still available.  Maybe there’s a secret trick that increases your chance of success ….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r966572767-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

The non alcoholic pairing was as well a little uninspired and starters (amuse bouche) as well as the sweets towards the end of the dining experience (the parts to be taken on the lower floor) a bit too simple “sweet&fatty” and thus a bit disappointing.

The name comes from the Old Norwegian translation of ‘Mother Earth’, although its chef Esben Holmboe Bang is actually Danish. But since he has spent most of his culinary career in Oslo, his cooking style is to explore the flavors of local Norwegian ingredients. According to him, 85% of the ingredients come from within 30 miles of Oslo, and the rest of the seafood on the menu, such as wild salmon cooked in salt butter, comes from the pristine waters of the northern coast of Norway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r962593813-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

From start to finish, the staff was kind, friendly, and attentive (we even got to go in the wine cellar when one of our waiters noticed us watching her select multiple bottles). This is our first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant, and it has set the bar high. The attention to detail, not only with paying attention to the guests, but the knowledge about the wine and food being served, was spectacular.

2024-02-20,P W 132,"Worst 3 Star ever…overpriced ($500 per person to start).  Food waaaaaaaay below 3 star quality.  Small bites were good, their oyster dish was very fishy, crab too salty, we asked for no mushrooms (and they said yes but had to remind-several times), there was a 30 min gap between one dish, we sent back a glass of merlot that was quite bad (from the Rhone) and rest of dishes very average.  Wine list not up to 3 star restaurant (but reasonably priced…for Oslo)-but we bought a 500$ Mersault which was quite good.  Very nice room.  BIG problem is Chef who thinks he is Guy Savoy (and is not)-they asked for feedback and we mentioned the above and Chef came to our table HOT and berated us-mentioning he did not have a microwave and suggested we could end our dining experience.  We gladly we took him up on that and saved a lot of money.  I have always believed that Norway is a kind and gentile place but when a 6 foot +++ Chef lords over your table and you have in your party one of the only non-white people in the restaurant you have to wonder…sorry Norway but don’t worry Chef is Danish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r939050902-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,1,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2023-09-17,Michael U,"As the only Michelin 3* Restautant in Norway Maaemo carries a banner, ""Mother Earth"" in Finnish Chef Esben Holmboe Bang serves a menu focused on organic, biodynamic, and raw local ingredients with the end-goal being zero waste but no restrictions in terms of taste or technique.   Found in the Oslobukta neighborhood diners begin and end in the lounge while a high-ceilinged dining room utililzes organic materials and dramatic lighting to draw attention to an open kitchen working in near silence across 15 courses.  Danish by heritage, though Esben’s plates consistently pay homage to Norwegian traditions, it comes as no surprise that Dinner begins with Potato Lompe topped in Cod plus Horseradish before proceeding through bites including Foie Gras, local Cheese and raw Beef topped in Pine Cone Vinegar.  Occasionally giving in to ""New Nordic"" ideals, though Butter and Fat see Maaemo’s flavors trend more rich than its contemporaries, plates in the dining room began with smoked Vendace Roe perfumed by elderflower that paired beautifully to 2020 Benjamin Leroux Chassagne-Montrachet.  Benefited by faultless service, every staff member executing at the highest level of personal yet professional engagement, Scallops arrived next with tart Fruits preceding Bang’s iconic Flat Oyster with Blue Mussels and Dill that has been a mainstay since 2010.  Pulling back in terms of intensity with a subtle plate of Turnips and Nettles, then serving a recently added slice of Char in a complicated Sauce that vacillates from sweet to savory, the night’s “main course” featured half a roasted Quail with Plums and Sunchokes alongside golden Milk Bread and a decorative spread made from Mushrooms with Garlic.  Cleansing the palate with earthy Consomme, bold but nuanced and a good bridge to Dessert placing Rhubarb amidst florals, it is here that diners return to the lounge for Coffee and sweets including Maaemo’s historic Brown Butter Ice Cream and hot, sticky Cinnamon Buns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r917041872-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2023-08-12,Connor M,"I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars.  Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive.  When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.  I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars.  I can't recommend this place unless you're rich and cost doesn't matter much to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r909829411-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,2,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2022-11-14,reisermedfamilie,"The only trouble with this establishment was finding the entrance, something that took a walk around the block, as we missed it at first glance.  It is discretely located on the corner of a block,  with an unassuming wooden door, where the only clue is a small brass plate above a door buzzer.   Other than that a perfect experience.  We found the difficulty in finding the entrance something to laugh about, not troubling.  Nonetheless, be sure to arrive a bit early, in order to locate the entrance. We appreciated being given a small folder with a  list of all of the courses, once  Once you buzz the door, you enter the vestibule where your coats are taken. Then you proceed to the ""living room"" downstairs, where welcome drinks and the first three to four courses are served.  Beautiful pieces of art to look at!  To describe these starters as an explosion of tastes would not do them true service.  These hors dóuevres are a carefully orchestrated gustatory  symphony of contrasting and complimenting tastes.  Be aware that the champagne costs extra.    After the starters,  you proceed to the dining room on the main floor, where several more courses are served, each one an experience in itself, with balanced combinations of flavours that I would not have imagined.  Each dish was lovely to look at, delightful to tase.  Then it is back to the ""living room"" to wind down with desserts.  The service was excellent, formal and highly attentive, yet still friendly and approachable with any questions.  The staff worked as a well-orchestrated team to ensure that the diners were served their courses with precision, and that any questions were answered. You can watch the cooks make the final preparations with precision.  We were a party of four, where I was the only one to take the wine package, which was very good, but perhaps a bit of a let-down given the price tag.  Nonetheless, I would probably go for the wine pairing again if I did it once more.  Be aware that each glass of wine is for about three courses.  One of the others took two glasses of wine, one white and one red, with the main courses. and were very pleased.  One member of the group  took a non-alcoholic beverage pairing which was remarkably good, an unconventional combination of ingredients that resulted in an impressive drink.  Yes, this experience does costs a small fortune, but it is worth it.  It was impressive on so many levels.  Be aware that this is a set menu.  I doubt that it would appeal to vegetarians or those with special dietary needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r868403022-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
2022-09-20,123bi456ro789,"I still cannot stop smiling when I think of what a good time we had at Maaemo. The interior, the decor, the atmosphere and last but not least the staff and the FOOD! I had been wanting to go since they opened twelve years ago but somehow I never managed to get a reservation and when I finally did, I had to cancel because of covid. But it certainly was worth the long wait. My husband and I could not even decide which dishes we liked best. Normally, we enjoy the starters, but it’s downhill from there because the main dishes are too large (and boring) when one would prefer to have more, and smaller, dishes to be able to taste more things. Not so here. Everything was perfect. And the dishes included all our favourite foods! We particularly enjoyed the innovative and creative takes on traditional  foodstuffs like the outstanding dish with reindeer hearts as well as the dishes with caviar from different sources. And pinnekjøtt more interesting than any I have had before. And lomper, shrimp, scallops, king crab, mushrooms and strawberries as well as  duck leg, beef, turbot, peas, quail and brioche and rhubarb. Even now, I am unable to say what I liked best. Interesting matching wines, too. And did I mention the outstanding staff? I was smiling all evening. Pure bliss.  Oops, I almost forgot. A good review needs something negative. Mhh, well … I couldn’t eat my second cinnamon bun. In retrospect, I would have loved to take it home. They were quite tasty, after all  Sorry, but this is all the negative I can come up with.

From the fireplace, the furniture, the smell, the pleasant silence even though people were speaking.  And then the food!!

2022-08-08,Mary Ella Feinleib,"I was thrilled to get a reservation at Maaemo, the northernmost Michelin three-star restaurant in the world. I'm sorry to have to say I was disappointed. I expect any three-star restaurant to have pretensions about its food, but I found Maaemo beyond pretentious. The servers were nice enough but so formal that the effect was chilling. First we we were taken to a dimly lit basement room for our starters. I could barely see what I was eating!  As each of the five  one-bite starters were presented, the waiter recited the ingredients--each of the five seemed to have five ingredients!  Precisely one hour later (everything here is timed to the  minute), I and the other diners were escorted up  to the dining room. The decor was stark but attractive and there was was more light here. My waitress stood  at my table and recited the ingredients of each of the eight main courses. Again, she was nice, but stiff. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, ""So, what's the next course going to be?"" ""Oh, I can't tell you that ahead of time."" (To be fair, she gave me a hint.)  The food itself was generally good, but only a few dishes stood out as excellent--disappointing for a three-star restaurant. And  I'm all for innovative food pairings, but the ""shoulder of crab with reindeer heart"" took this concept a bit over the top. I must say that every course was artistically plated. An hour and a half later, to the second, it was downstairs again, for dessert. I enjoyed most of the desserts more than I had enjoyed the starters.   Half an hour later came the check, which was exorbitant, but not inappropriately so. This was not my favorite restaurant meal, but it was my most interesting restaurant experience.  Maaemo, please lighten up a bit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r852898542-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,3,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks

2022-07-11,DvA,"There are very few restaurants in the world that take your breath away when you enter them because you realise: This is something special, something magical! Maaemo definitely is one of them. Within the first few minutes of entering the building, chatting with the staff, and climbing downstairs to the living room, you realise you are in for an unforgettable night. Maaemo has a unique, elegant and focused but still very cosy style. It elevates your mood immediately. And the food is right up there with the very best in the world: Every single one of the small bites served in the living room at the beginning of the meal is spectacular in all preparation, presentation, and taste. Entering the main dining room upstairs is another wow moment. It is one of the most beautiful restaurant settings I have seen, with an impressive open kitchen, a fire place, and spectacular art on all walls of the very high room. Throughout the meal, the interactions with staff and the quality of food are kept at highest level. The absolute highlight of our menu was a filet of line caught Norwegian salmon that was by far the best piece of fish I have ever tasted. It had nothing in common with the regular salmon you get in other restaurants or supermarkets. With its perfect combination of a light sea taste, seductive fat layers, and creamy texture it seemed to come from a different world. After that, the main course of the menu was the only disappointment of our visit: A piece of lamb, proudly presented at the table before being roasted over the grill, had barely any taste. An anticlimax to an otherwise flawless meal. The night at Maaemo ends with delicious friandises and coffee (roasted and brewed to perfection on-site) served downstairs again. The cinnamon buns are so good that you should seize the opportunity and take a few extra ones with you to enjoy the next day. This is one way of prolonging this fantastic experience for a few more hours. The memories, however, will stay forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r847291755-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en,person_1_removed_line_breaks
