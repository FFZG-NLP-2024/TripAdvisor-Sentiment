The menu was set all around Malaysian produce. Along with this, we sat within feet of the Pass, as well as the prep area for all the amazing puddings! Chef Kevin talked us through his ideas,explaining what the menu flowed as it did.

2024-09-30,Rajamora,"This elegant but ungrandiose 3-Michelin star dining establishment a joint continuing hospitality project of the three Roca brothers Joan (head chef), Josep (sommelier) and Jordi (pastry chef) , built on the foundation of their parents’ modest restaurant featuring Catalan cuisine.  The 45-customer restaurant continues the Catalonian focus but given spectacular depth and scope by Joan’s adaptive creativity.  Feasting on a signature degustacion offering like, say, the “Festival Menu” that we enjoyed, the questing diner understands why Joan’s impressively realized gustatory imaginings made El Celler de Can Roca one of the only four restaurants with multiple “Best Restaurant in the World” accolades - at par with Napa’s “The French Laundry” with two, and only behind the legendary “El Bulli” and Copenhagen’s “Noma” at five Firsts each.  The lagniappe to the experience was to encounter Joan himself three times during the night and engage him in increasingly playful interactions.  There is nothing like a great chef unencumbered by grandiosity but crowned with a wonderful sense of humor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r972087809-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2024-05-21,Anna M,"We travelled to Girona specifically to visit this restaurant.  We were so excited to get a reservation and built our trip around this visit.  We wanted to visit after seeing the Chef's Table episode on Netflix and were expecting something very special.  We have been to many Michelin restaurants with a few 3 star under our belts.  This experience was very average and does not align with what one would expect for a 3 star rating.  It was awkward from the moment we entered where there was no one at the front to greet us and we stood around looking for someone to help us out.  We thought maybe we came through the wrong door!!  Not a single question was asked of why we were there (Anniversary, Birthday, etc.) , where we were from, etc..  The restaurant itself is very nice - very comfortable setting with a beautiful natural landscape in the center and nicely spaced tables.  After sitting we waited a while again for the menu and water service, which in Europe I am OK with, but for a place like this it is not acceptable.  These are little things, but definitely not what is expected for a restaurant at this level.  We were at Disfrutar a few nights earlier and the service was exceptional and they made a real effort to appreciate that you were at their establishment.    As far as the menu goes we opted for the short menu - our mistake - if you do go be sure to get the longer experience because the timing isn't much longer and some key dishes are missing from the short menu - especially the desserts.  The food was good but nothing was exceptional.  Execution and quality of the ingredients is what you would expect, but nothing was good enough to talk to your friends about.  In fact, the main meat dish, which was a take on a beef Wellington, but used poultry elements was just not good and not incredibly original.  The ratio of the dough to the filling was off so there was more crust than needed and not a very tasty execution of the proteins.    The biggest letdown was the desserts, the primary reason we came, which were very average.  The first dish was an ensemble made from sheep's milk - this was pretty good and had a cone that had the scent of a sheep which made it kind of fun.  The next dish was confusing.  It was supposed to be a take on the memories from reading books, I think, where the aroma is supposed to based on the smell of old books.  We were given a splash of oil on the hands that was supposed to be this scent, which you licked before embarking on eating the dish.  The dish was not interesting and did not provide any sort of continuity both in flavor or texture and did not seem to align with the theme that was explained to us.  The dish also did not go well with the first dessert because both desserts were pretty heavy milk based recipes.  Finally - in fear of sounding pretentious, when I went to go to the restrooms I was super confused on where they were so I walked back and forth across the mirrored walls looking for the door, which ended my night in a similar way that it started - awkward...  Most Michelin restaurants walk you to the restrooms and ensure that you know your way around.  Our opinion is that El Celler de Can Roca is at a Michelin level but definitely not worth a special trip nor did the service or food stand out as anything special.  We have had more creative dishes both in presentation and flavor at many other restaurants and service was not on par with the other 2 and 3 star restaurants we have visited.  Even many of the one star restaurants had a more immersive and welcoming experience than El Celler de Can Roca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r951771154-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,3,en
2024-05-04,Greg T,"We've tried for two years to get a booking as we've lost out to the bots, so we had high hopes for our one-year wedding anniversary dinner after staying up until midnight to get this booking (we got married near Girona, so this place had a lot of meaning.) We also chose to have our wedding dessert from rocambolesc last year so this restaurant meant so much to us. We actually told the staff this, and they didn't care at all!!!!. The last 3 Michelin-starred restaurant we ate at was HÉLÈNE DARROZE last month, and wow, did they bring out all the stops!!! (they made a special newspaper for us and as soon as we entered they told us how grateful they were to choose them to celebrate our lunch with them. From the moment we entered their restaurant, we were made to feel so special. At el celler de can rocca, however,  no one was made to feel special that we could see, especially us! . We chose to celebrate our one-year wedding anniversary here, and we truly regret this decision. We had even said before we would bring our wedding party back here for our ten years - sadly, we wouldn't even come back for petit fours.   When you choose to save and spend your hard-earned money at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant, which is at least £1000 for a couple, you would hope that you at least get greeted well. They couldn't even find out booking initially!   The food, in all honesty, was pretty boring, void of fun and personality, and everything had a foam or emulsion that tasted the same.  I've never felt the need to say something in a place like this, but I was so frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. When I excused myself and asked to speak to someone, I was met with excuses of how they were going to bring out a dessert for us. However, it was a little too late. The effort should have been made from the moment we arrived. I appreciated the apology, but it wasn't really heart felt.   This restaurant has no business holding three Michelin stars! That extra star is reserved for the wonderful restaurants that go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and appreciated.   I had hoped something special would happen at the end the meal to make up for the truly poor experience but it did not manifest.   take your money elsewhere to restaurants that do not rely on reputation.    A real, real, really wasted evening!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r949511572-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en

2023-08-08,melandashfoodies,"Sorry for my belated review, I am playing catch up. Avid user of trip advisor but need to be better with adding my own reviews as it is such a useful tool.  It is quite easy to see why this restaurant is considered one of the best in the world.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and sat in a very unassuming part of town away from all of the hustle and bustle of Girona. Due to the upmarket design, it did feel a little stuffy to us, but it really is a gorgeous place and certainly did not hinder our enjoyment of our tasting menu.  The food is beautifully presented, stunningly tasty but for me,  having watched chefs table and the cigar course, I expected a bit more  theatre. That being said we were served an amazing course that rained to create a jus and this was stunningly presented and tasted divine!   The wine list was huge and we opted for a flight to go with our meal and all of the wines on it were lovely, as per the norm for restaurants of this calibre, there was wine for every taste and budget and the staff were attentive and friendly and were able to explain the dishes to us in English.  A great experience and I would recommend visiting here if food is your thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r908812594-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en
2023-08-02,James T,"This is everything you'd expect from a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars.  The food was beautifully presented with great professionalism and the occasional piece of theatre.  The initial sequences taking you on a gastronomic history of the three chefs' was fantastic: I particularly loved the ""chicken muffin,"" which was no larger than a thumb nail but somehow managed to yield a different flavour of a roast chicken dinner every time I chewed it.  We opted for the Feast Menu with wine pairings, which the waiter described as the restaurant's ""full experience.""  We lost count of the number of courses but it was more than 10, especially when you count the pre-menu courses and the petits fours.  A very small glass of wine perfectly paired with each course was wonderful and meant we got to try many wines we would never normally drink.  The two burgundys (a pinot noir and an almost creamy unoaked chardonnay) were standout selections.  Other courses of note were the celeriac mille feuille, the textures of tomato, the macadamia rose with the helium strawberry foam (surely all restaurants should have a helium foam trolley?) and the grilled egg plant.  I would have like to have seen a cheese course given the otherwise enormous breadth of the menu.  The petits fours trolley was something straight out of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the theme was lovely to see repeated in the sweet shop in central Girona.  Service was excellent although the waiters sometimes talked a little too quickly to catch everything.  It's difficult for them as there are so many courses and timing for some of them is critical in order for the plate to arrive in the right state (foams, ice creams etc).  The waiters were very knowledgeable and able to have a conversation about every single thing on the menu.  The cost is naturally high but given haute cuisine prices in major cities and the very considerable amount of investment in the restaurant and the menu, prices were within the range I had expected.  A truly memorable experience highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r907384675-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,5,en

It’s the perfect amount , for the plates are quiet small , meant for you to tast each flavour without feeling full at any moment.

2023-07-06,Joanne P,"We were so looking forward to this and overall it was very disappointing compared to Arzak and Berasategui. We chose the smaller tasting menu (as I've learnt that I can't manage a 13-course one) - 230€ for 5 dishes and 2 deserts with 85€ wine pairing (8 wines).  There was complimentary house cava which I thought a nice touch.   Before the menu however there were some 15 amuse bouches, meaning I was feeling fullish and overloaded before we even started on it; one of these was sole on crispy skin which was like leather which I had to remove from my mouth into a tissue (and in the absence of a plate - they were served in a series onto a 2x2x2cm granite 'post'  - put in my bag for later disposal).  There were a couple of stand out dishes - the celeriac,  the langostine and the caramelised apricot.  Unfortunately the poularde star of the show was encased in brioche which was soggy inside. Some imperfections in the space as well - thin, loose-laid carpets which looked rumpled and had the rubber underlay showing, loose and grubby soap dispenser in the men's toilet. Not a 3 star experience. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r900948718-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en

2023-06-14,Oscar,"Service/Decor: The restaurant is beautiful—modern, clean, and simply decorated without being sterile, the decor and natural lighting makes the place warm and inviting. The service is phenomenal, no request is too large. Everyone who assisted us (too many waiters, sommeliers, and other staff to name) were both professional and friendly. The entire service lasted four and a half hours, but was orchestrated magically. Plates and glasses were cleared without distraction, and courses were well explained. We were given a tour of the kitchen after asking, and Joan and Jordi both posed for pictures and signed our books we had purchased.  Food and Beverage: The feast menu is about 13 courses, but also includes about 15 appetizers. It sounds like a ton of food, but you are not rushed at all. Take your time, savor every bite and enjoy the moment. I had gastric surgery and was very worried about not being able to make it through, but I finished the meal along with a wine pairing. You may not love every dish, but this is not just food, this is art. Art may sometimes bother or challenge your perceptions, but take it as part of the experience. I was the only one at the table who chose the wine pairing, which was expertly presented with wines from across Europe. Every wine was delicious, and the pairing was explained well. I shared my pairing with my aunt, as I do not drink too much, but wanted to fully experience the offerings of all three brothers.  Overall, this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.

2022-12-19,Sarosh K,"As a disciple of gastronomy, i found myself last Saturday in Girona, a delightful cobblestoned medieval town a couple of hours north of Barcelona, the site of celebrated 3 Michelin El Celler de Can Roca, the brainchild of the famed Brothers Roca.   I found later that Girona, dating back to pre-Roman empire times, is not only a cycling Mecca, the favorite training base of multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, but also the backdrop for many scenes of the popular TV series Game of Thrones. Picturesque and dramatic it certainly is.   A few years earlier, i had been fortunate enough to have persuaded the chef at 2 Michelin star Dani Maison on the island of Ischia, near Napoles, to open the restaurant for lunch specially for my party of 8, since all dinner reservations had been spoken for many months ago, for the entire week i had been scheduled to be in the area, with none of the cancellations we had been hoping for.   After we explained the situation and begged (piteously!) several times, the chef had been gracious enough to round up his crew and accommodate us. It was simply the best meal of my life, especially memorable since i make it a point to experience as many Michelin restaurants as i can during my travels.   We had been sailing the Amalfi Coast, a week of Michelin delight, stopping in at the various coastal towns and villages: to name a few, Capri, Positano, Sorrento and other equally impossibly beautiful and romantic medieval towns, setting our sailing schedule to match the reservations we had been able to procure.  A 3 Michelin meal is supposedly particularly worth making a special trip for. So, it was with great hope and anticipation that we made a transcontinental trip to Barcelona, and then a couple hours north, deep into the separatist province of Catalunya, on the Iberian peninsula, for El Celler de Can Roca.   My niece Gayatri had somehow managed a snag a reservation for 715pm for this date, due to a cancellation some months prior. So my travel plans were built around this reservation.   The entrance to the restaurant is dramatic, as the backlit ivy-covered passage walls suddenly open onto a large outdoor seating courtyard visible from the angled floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Since it is winter, and temperatures are quite cold, there were no patrons outdoors, but it must be quite pleasant in warmer times.   As we entered the restaurant, we found one of the well-coiffed brothers Roca industriously signing the flyleaf of a pile of books on the counter. It appears there is a whole section of coffee table books devoted to recipes and descriptions of the meal we were about to experience. Our salivary glands quivered!  While expensive (prix fixe 270 €) that’s not excessive for 12 courses following 16 appetizers. I had skipped lunch, in anticipation! But it is definitively caloric overkill, while visually and creatively impressive.  We were  informed by the proud waiter that no fewer than 400 fresh organic local ingredients had been used to prepare a specially curated vegetarian meal.   The venue, service, technical expertise and presentation were impeccable, but i  found the taste itself bland, insipid, unidimensional and uninspired, with many sauces and textures indistinguishable from each other,  a real letdown and disappointment. Oh, well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187499-d996088-r872257048-El_Celler_de_Can_Roca-Girona_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,2,en
2022-12-18,KingofCoogee,"We started our journey running into Jordi Roca in the car park.  I wasn’t sure what omen this was meant to be. We arrived with big expectations.  We were greeted and seamlessly seated.  They were staff gliding about everywhere, all knowing where to be an what to do.

We started with appetizers which were not on the menu and they seemed to keep coming. All of these were magnifícant.   The menu and the wine paring commented. Over 4 hours we experienced magic.

2024-10-30,dyhx,"A Michelin starred restaurant serving traditional Taiwanese. We went for their set menu which included a few of their signatures. In general, it fell short of my expectations. The food was of a good quality but it didn't wow, neither in taste nor in food presentation. I did enjoy the Roasted Suckling Pig which was served in 3 ways - crackling skin (1 pc each only), meat and ribs, shredded meat in Gua Bao. The traditional fried bee hoon was delish too, so basic, so simple but yummy, using their local bee hoon that's more bouncy in texture. The dessert was also interesting, first time having grass jelly in pure liquid form instead of the solidified jelly and to have it with crushed peanuts added a different dimension. I was disappointed though that they didn't ask about nut allergy, not that I have it but I expected that of a Michelin star restaurant charging S$160 per pax.

I love the private room on the ground floor. It can seat 14 guests with its own garden (ideal for guests who smoke). It's great for family gathering and friends visiting from overseas.   Of course it's not cheap. But you get what you pay for, right? Once in awhile it's alright to splurge and indulge! Reservation is a must if you wish to book the private room. The food presentation is very elegant, fitting to go with the ambience. It can serve meat lovers as well as vegetarians. Certain dishes have to be ordered in advance. If you like seafood, there's a live seafood tank where you can choose and pick the ones you like and how you want it to be cooked.

2016-11-09,Ambrosiameister,"Perhaps this is a restaurant better suited for families and bigger parties so that the chef is incentivized to cook a better meal. Decor is quaint but the food is really terrible. First of all, they charge NT150 per person for water, not sparkling water, just water, even just hot water. We were only 2 so could not order many dishes. I ordered their abalone (NT 380 for one tiny abalone) which had the stale taste of something that has been kept in the fridge for a while. In any case, the strong peppery taste was totally unsuitable for an abalone. Then came the most horrible dish of a fried ""dumpling"" with oyster and pork stuffing. From the menu, you would have thought that there was one oyster inside the dough but there were literally 2 small pieces of chopped oyster and 1 tiny slither of pork. Most disappointing was the dough which tasted of old flour. We just could not eat the dough it tasted so bad. We had a dish of ""organic"" vegetables so full of fried garlic, you could not taste the freshness of the vegetables. Finally, the dish of fried rice vermicelli tasted so common, any street vendor could have done better and frankly at NT 500, one would have expected more. In addition, we waited for 45 minutes before we had anything to eat. There was no coordination in how the dishes arrived. After the long wait, we were served the vegetables, nothing else. Then it was another 15 minute wait for the fried oyster dumplings, followed by another 10 minute wait for the vermicelli. We were told that since everything was ""freshly"" made, waiting time was long. I do not mind the waiting time if the food was any good but to wait such a long time for bad food was so frustrating when there is such an abundance of excellent food in Taipei for a lot less. The bill came to a bit more than NT 2000 for 2 people for one abalone, one dish of common vegetables, fried rice vermicelli and dumplings with stale tasting dough which we could not eat. Having read all the excellent reviews, I am still wondering what has gone wrong that evening.

2016-03-12,DineAboutWorld,My chef friend took me there with much anticipation as he seldom lets me down.  But what a joke of a place...first sign was the steep prices in a town where great food is very reasonable.  The Royal platter appetizers were highly recommended at NT1900 but I nibbled on a few pieces as most of it awful.  Most of the fat in the plate selection were made of white un-rendered  fat and almost all with no seasoning and flavor.  Some of the supposedly local food inspired creations were 10X street food prices and tasted 10X worse.  The chive turnovers were so freezer burned that is tasted and looked like something you might venture had you not eaten in weeks.  The grouper type fish (they didn't know) on ice (buried in ice actually as no live fish were in the fancy tanks) was suggested steamed but I knew it was going to be bad and if was...flesh was damaged by the ice temp and you can't property steam a fish 120NT/Lian (100g) so $60 fish ruined.   Also the chef likes to put cilantro ruffs on every dish...like bad Chinese restaurants in the US.  Why?  It was even on the steam fish instead of spring onion julienne which traditionally burst with sizzling oil.  There were even basic technical faults like seeds of cucumber in julienne base as they didn't even core out the cucumber.  Service was trained to pretend you are Ina nice villa but no one asked us why we left so much food uneaten.  Also they list a Brunello as a Cab blend...at outrageous prices with no vintages.  Three of us spent 12000NT and that my friend...that is a true rip-off!

We finally found a place and we came to know why this place is difficult to book a table. Plan in advance. Absolutely delicious and inspired. It’s worth it.

The müsli with baked apple loved it, the brioche with mushrooms on ranch sauce great and last but not least the probability best focaccia we ever tasted served with grilled peppers, humus and garlic spread.  Nice and attentive service made this brunch an even nicer moment.  We are looking forward to our upcoming dinner reservation.

2023-10-30,Martin K,"We always wanted to eat at Kle during one of our trips to Zurich. So our expectations were high when we finally managed to reserve a table in time. Unfortunately, our expectations were not fulfilled at all: We were informed that we had exactly 2 hours to eat in this Michelin-starred restaurant. When we arrived at 5:45 p.m., there was a sign at the door asking us to wait outside, which is not exactly pleasant in autumn temperatures. Once we were let in (5:55 p.m.), we ordered the 4-course menu. We were asked each time whether we liked it, and we answered ""too sour, too raw, just not an explosion of flavor, just not savoureux."" In response to our criticism, we were brought an additional course without asking us whether we wanted it. Unfortunately, this one wasn't great either, although it was a little better than the others. At least the dessert was good and met our expectations. We have to admit, we have traveled a lot around the world, spend a lot of money on eating out and have been to a few vegan/vegetarian restaurants, but we didn't understand Kle's cuisine. The friendly service and homely atmosphere don't help either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188113-d20049239-r923640772-KLE_Restaurant-Zurich.html,2,en

We were a little concerned at first with only 2 hours, but it was completely enough and you can see that a well-harmonized team works together at  KLE.  I am a chef in Lucerne myself and really appreciate evenings like this of this quality.  I just wanted to report back, because feedback is very important these days  And encouraging, because unfortunately there are other voices on the Internet that I have seen that are absolutely not appropriate!

2023-07-25,Food lover,"It was our third visit in the last two years. We arrived with memories of very tasty food, but also of slow service. We hoped to see improvement on that front, but unfortunately, our experience did not start or end well.  We waited for an amuse-bouche for almost 40 minutes, which was quite long, and we had expected quicker service. The first appetizer was served after another half hour, and the waiting time between meals remained long throughout the diner. It was at least twice the time that would be acceptable. After more than three hours, I mentioned the issue to the (otherwise very pleasant and friendly) waiters, but it had no effect on the pace of service. It took us over 5 hours to complete the 11-course meal. Moreover, the lack of air conditioning made the environment very hot, especially during a hot summer day.  While I thought the food was nice, I would definitely not repeat the experience again. I discreetly emailed my comments to the restaurant the next day, and I received a reply after two weeks. They apologized and mentioned delayed reconstructions, and they expressed hope that we would be fully satisfied next time. Bad excuse, because no one mentioned anyting during our reservation, upon arrival or when paying the bill. Not to mention that this was our third ‘slow’ experience, and that portable air conditioners are now sold at a lower price than the cost of a single dinner.   However, after careful discussion with other guests who were also present, we decided that three opportunities were enough. A Michelin-starred restaurant should provide a full service experience, not just good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r905563585-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en
2023-01-23,Ernest Novak,"The cold and sparse reception did not make an impression.  No explanation about the food.  That's something.  Freshwater fish are offered as sea fish.  Poor selection of wines by the glass for such an expensive restaurant.  Describing tannins in white wine (?!) is almost alarming.  Given that they offer locally produced food, I would expect more than just 4 slices of veal loin, but not necessarily in quantity.  The fish was tasteless, too greasy, practically inedible in the unfortunate combination.  The only positive thing was a really nice and good dessert, and of course the beautiful white landscape.  In short, STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g5985537-d5267378-r876113603-GRIC_LUKA_KOSIR-Sentjost_Nad_Horjulom_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,2,en

Also the wine pairing was fantastic and my husband did the non-alcoholic version that was even better with incredible juices, kombuchas, teas, etc. Thank you Henry for your meticulous work on those! It was 7 courses but with the chefs greetings and bonus desserts it felt more like 20. We loved all the local ingredients and felt like it was a truly authentic experience — they didn’t try too hard, it was just right. We loved loved loved all the dishes.

I liked the dishes I ate in September slightly more than this time, but you have to know they use only homegrown, local, and foraged foods which vary throughout the seasons.

2022-03-25,Ales 924,"I heard it used to be a nice and good restaurant. Good inns are often hidden in remote locations - this is NOT the case here. The house is nothing special from the outside, nor is it inside, but it is poorly heated space - maybe they don't have firewood?!. The 3.5-hour time consuming food service consists of surrealistically small portions with a quasi-artistic touch and a high price. The “Michelin star” is vulgarly exploited to find the upper limit of guests ’naivety & stupidity. It all looks like a bad joke. To be able to separate the dish from the decoration, the staff constantly explains the composition of the miniature food brought on small pedestals. I also saw the head chef at the next table, he was quite a big guy - I thought - he probably eats somewhere else. The wine is good but nothing special.  CONCLUSION: this is not a restaurant, this is a very expensive and time consuming tasting of miniature portions of edible dishes ...

This last visit disappointed us so much, the restaurant sadly decided to minimize their portions and also the atmosphere changed.  Plates in summer 2021, post second covid lockdown, aren’t what they were in 2020 or even before. I would estimate they are 3 times smaller now!  We’ve been offered 2 pieces of bread throughout the evening, which is borderline insulting, the staff didn’t ask - not even once - if we are satisfied with the food, not even at the end when we left.  Food was mediocre, but most of all - it was tiny. 7 tiny plates for 60 euros, every plate consisted of maximum 2 bites with the main course being a joke. A small piece of fish.  So hungry now we are going for a take out, after spending 150 euros for nothing - a few bites!!  It’s sad to see what happened with this restaurant and sadly none of my family or friends will be returning.  Im not sure if saving money by minimizing the portions was worth it.

Elegant plates, completely different for each dish, proper glasses. I liked the food the first time, it now got even better and more sparkingly creative.

2024-10-15,CEO,"We booked a dinner at this restaurant weeks before our trip to Buenos Aires. They responded promptly and confirmed  our reservation. The restaurant was quite busy for a Monday. Reception staff were warm, friendly, and efficient. She showed us to our table as soon as she confirmed our reservation. Wait staff were outstanding. They gave us time to get settled in and go over the menu. Their wine list is extensive. We started with arugula salad. Fresh, tasty, and enough to share with two people. Our T Bone steak was simply delicious. It was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly as we requested. The grilled mushrooms were sweet and smokey. Their desserts were well worth the extra calories. This is a great place for steaks. We will be back for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r974056459-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,5,en

It does steak and that’s about it - except for sausage for starters - there are sides including veg and salads - mashed potato favoured by many and the ubiquitous French fries.  Long wine list with excellent choice.   Wonderful greeting just outside the front with a  glass of sparking. Attentive helpful staff. A very classy slick operation that feels personal.

2024-09-20,WanderingOttersons,"This place comes as a VERY highly rated option on the restaurant scene.  From the moment we arrived, I began to wonder.  We showed up a little ahead of time for our reservation and they seemed very confused and disorganized.  We had to wait more than 10 minutes past our reservation to be seated, standing awkwardly outside with the smokers.  The service was good.  Not quite what I was hoping based on the expectations.  The starters were excellent, the meals were good.  Yes, you are going to get a good steak here.  You can do that in MANY places in this country, though.  The prices you pay are not returned with a higher value or quality meal from our experience.  We had multiple meals at a nearby steak restaurant that were superior to this and MUCH cheaper.  I'd say, find another option.  It wasn't worth the hype for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r970609335-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,3,en

2024-08-19,lfz,"First off, service is outstanding! They welcome you with a glass of white sparkling wine and a empanada before you are seated. We sat at an outside table, and even though it was around 14 celsius outside, they had a lot of warmers and blankets.  We ordered a traditional provoleta and they brought a chorizo too (for free). This appetizers were very good, not to out of the ordinary but very good still. Then, we ordered an ojo de bife (ribeye) and a cuadril de bife with a side of mashed potatoes with trouffle shavings and a side of Brussel sprouts. Meat was excellent, maybe the ribeye was a little bit dry but that is just expected from the cut, but the flavor was intensely good. The sides were way out of the ordinary, they were delicious, specially the Brussel sprouts (ordering this is a must).  After a meal made for the gods, we ordered some ice cream for dessert and they brought three flavors, two of which were free (they apparently liked us very much). We had the dulce de leche, samboyan and milk ice cream covered with hot chocolate. The three were very good, I have tried some dulce de leche ice creams that are a little better but the other two were out of this world!  In regards of price, we ordered a lot of food with the outstanding service of the waiters and it was only $60 each including drinks.

2024-07-31,wernerlin,"Before going to Don Julio, I read with some concern the varying reviews, but, thankfully, in the end our meal was wonderful from start to finish, a truly memorable evening. As there has already been a ton of prose written about Don Julio, I’ll bullet point key observations:  - Reservations: You absolutely need to get a reservation way in advance. As soon as you know you’ll be going to Buenos Aires, go to Don Julio’s website and try to book a reservation. Even if it’s before the roughly 80 days when you can actually reserve the table, you can/should enter your e-mail address to be notified when reservations open up for your desired date/time - this is called a early-access request. Then, when you get the e-mail notifying you that reservations are open for your requested date/time (“Convert your early-access request into a reservation”), immediately go and book a table. But it doesn’t end there - you will get two additional e-mails as your reservation approaches, one to confirm, and then another to confirm again and enter a credit card in case you are a no-show. Obviously, keep an eye out for those in your inbox and respond promptly. - Arriving: Arrive a few minutes early and expect that you will wait in line to check in for your reservation - for our opening 7p reservation, we waited maybe 7 minutes in line to get to the receptionist. Happily, every now and then a waiter will come by and offer a complimentary glass of spumanti (a carbonated wine drink, like champagne but a bit sweet) to make the time go by faster.  - Ordering: If you’re not sure about which steak to order, ask your server to take you up to the central open grill where the different cuts are laid out, to show you what’s what. - Dining: Note that the steaks tend to be lightly salted, at least compared to the sodium-heavy US standard. We found that adding a nice pinch of salt, thoughtfully provided as a matter of course in a small bowl alongside criollo and chimichurri, really brought out the amazing quality of the beef. I might be wrong, but I suspect some of the other reviews mentioning lackluster flavor was due to the lighter salting. - Service: Our waiter was super friendly and responded enthusiastically to any request we had, like additional oil for our bread, adjusting the table, etc. Just be aware that the service can be more akin to the Argentinian style, where they consider it rude to pester or rush you, so if you want anything, e.g. another glass of wine or the check at the end of the meal, just get your server’s attention and politely ask. Unlike the US, they won’t constantly check on you and then plop a check on your table to turn it over ASAP.    Is it pricey compared to other parrillas in Buenos Aires? Absolutely, though it’s only mid to upper-range by New York standards. Does it cater to tourists? Yes, at least based on the clientele when we visited. Really, though, the bottom line is that our dinner was the one of the best experiences we’ve had dining out. The lovely ambiance, the amazing food, the thoughtful little extras like the spumanti, and the top-notch service made it a lovely night to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312741-d1066728-r962621384-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,5,en

Very nice styling and decorations with a large fire at one end with a warm feel but modern. The food was simply excellent and the presentation was amazing. One of the main positive points was that at the same table we could have 2 different gourmet menus. This is very unusual and a huge plus for this restaurant. The food was really excellent - I had the Autumn menu and my husband the gourmet menù. The food was innovative in putting together so many tastes and cooking styles. Presentation was inspired and works of art. Really not sure we have eaten better with an exception of  a 3 star Michelin.

2019-02-14,Fabio B,"Lanterna Verde ( litterally Green Lantern ) is one of those restaurant that noboby crossing that aera of Nord Lombardy should miss. Particularly for those reaching Engadina Valley and St Moritz from the Italian border is a must to stop there for lunch or dinner. Lanterna Verde has one Michelin star sice one decade and I have never taste a wrong plate in so many visits I did. There are a couple of set menu , one based on the tradition the other with some innovation . the quality of the ingrediences is at the top and Nord valley Italy plates are the main receipts. The family running the restaurant by tradition they farm troutes in the cold waters coming from aroud and for those who wish to try this preciouse fresh water fish it a immense pleasure. The presentation of all plates is impeccable and the taste even more. Esquisit appetizer , classis rise and past and main course of great interest where game or particular cuts are always available top breake the monotony of red meet .Very seldom my appetite and taste is challenged to such satisfaction. When choosing wine you will be surprised by the number of labels available , better ask to the boss somelier who will advice you best with some few bottle production lebels impossible to find elsewhere. Most of top wines are there but trust me try some small producers reccomended by them. Price for 2 with good wine included is less than what you can spent in St Moritz for one person in an average place with non entusiastic food .

2016-09-13,TheGlobalIndian,"We dinned at this beautiful restaurant based on recommendation given by my hotel at Lake Como. We drove an hour to reach this well located restaurant, and were served by Joanna. The food we tried here was awesome, and the staff was friendly only until the time we got our bill.  This restaurant is frequented by locals, and they don't have many tourists as guests, which is a good thing as you get authentic food, but on the other side they took tourist for a ride with their bill.  The prices in the menu were different from what they charged us in the bill. Example Pizzoccheri was priced at €14 in menu but was charged at €20 in the bill and Rissoto was priced at €18 in the menu but was charged to us at €24.   We asked what was their soup of the day, and we were told it was Mushroom soup, though a very beautiful soup, since the prices were not in the Menu for the soup, we assumed it would be priced similar to other appetizers in the menu. We were shocked to see €30 for a soup in the invoice.  I would say the food was very good. Given that its a very nice restaurant, good food, we won't have minded paying the prices they charged, but to be fair you cannot charge more than what you put out in your Menu card.   I did try asking Joanna about the Soup, and she said its because the mushrooms are high quality and hence the cost. For other items I didn't realise till the time I returned home and compared the prices in the bill with the prices on the menu published online on their website.  It was really shocking for us to see a restaurant with such great reputation would act so low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3346498-d907762-r418318198-Lanterna_Verde-Villa_di_Chiavenna_Province_of_Sondrio_Lombardy.html,3,en

In this recent visit we went there for diner instead and I was really disappointed.  Don't know if that has to do because there were only 3 tables for the whole evening. The nice elegant dining room was closed. We were all being sitted at the other side of a very un-cosy room with old fashion green colour wall paper and many old collection radios; with the radio on through out the whole diner. The lighing was really unsupportable.The chair was so uncomfortable, very hard without any cushion. The whole dining atomsphere were all ruined. We both have the Goutmet & Gourmand menu but the food was not as the past standard. I guess they do more affort for lunch because of people from Switzerland or businese people coming for lunch.

2014-12-30,Ezrail,"This is what Italy is famous for. From the moment you enter the restaurant (actually, even before, when you make a reservation), you're welcomed so warmly it immediately puts you in a perfect mood. The ambiance is warm and peaceful, the setting very comfortable, and there is plenty of space around your table not to feel crammed. A fireplace crackling is just the perfect touch. Large tables, wonderful white linens, elegant plates, cutlery and glasses, but yet simple enough to still make you feel at home and comfortable. The food is so carefully prepared, with fresh and beautiful ingredients, it blows you away. No half measures, the flavors are wonderful. Among other delights, we tasted some of the most outstanding pizzoccheri ever. Both authentic and refined, perfectly balanced. The cuisine in general is very refined, but without losing sight of the authentic flavors it is inspired by. From the perfect home-made fresh bread (absolutely wonderful), all the way through some of the most amazing sorbets, the food is just impeccable. The wine list is a treasure trove. They have an amazing selection of beautiful Italian wines (and a few French gems), but the prices are so competitive and honest you almost feel guilty. I have rarely seen such a good selection of Barolos and Barbarescos, of the perfect vintages and by the best producers, at such honest prices. A true gem. By the way, they do have the wines that appear on the list: I ordered one of my favorite Barbarescos, and there it came, at perfect cellar temperature, and so well kept the label was perfectly clean. Magnificent Riedel decanter, more than perfect Riedel glasses, impeccable service. About the service, it could not be better. Attentive and very friendly, but discrete and never overwhelming. The rhythm was perfect, with dishes served gracefully and timely. If only they got rid of the background music, gentle but not suitable for the perfect atmosphere, they would hit a home run.

The food was excellent! We both had ravioli ripieni di lenticchie, my husband had pernice and I had the carciofo con uovo e tartufo nero. For dessert we had creme brûlée con panettone and fondente di cioccolato - delicious! The service was very attentive - fantastic! They made us feel at home. We found it very fairly priced, especially for a Michelin starred restaurant and located so close to the very expensive Engadin.

2024-09-20,CONSOLE067,"One of the best starred restaurants in Italy. We returned years later. Then at the helm of the kitchen was the uncle never forgotten, today instead the nephew but the result at the table remained excellent. Class, dedication, technique, elegance are the main ingredients of this starred cuisine, also convenient in value for money, which is rare nowadays. In the dining room, the chef's parents welcome guests and wisely dictate the timing of the service. We chose the four-course Valchiavenna menu (€ 75.00). Very interesting and fun the possibility to compose your own a la carte route by choosing individual courses from the different tasting menus. After the entrée, a delicious potato cream with trout eggs, olive cream, capers and fennel, we started the tasting path with the valley cold cuts with porcini mushroom in oil and dairy butter: bresaola, bacon, coppa and salami, all of excellent choice and quality. As a first course, the famous tajadin dulz de Villa, a kind of maltagliati or rags made from chestnut flour and white flour with cheese and chamomile aroma, well cooked and very tasty. Extraordinary is the second or veal shank cooked in hay brought to the table with the saucepan and of which we are explained the preparation that includes in the final moment even a very short flame with fire to give the dish that incredibly delicate and pleasant touch of smoked. As an accompaniment to the main course, the characteristic rustiment, a kind of pie made with polenta, potatoes, green beans and leek with incredible potato chip spaghetti on top. Well-kept, as indeed all the courses, the dessert: cherries, dark chocolate and fennel sorbet, basically a dark chocolate humus with fresh cherries underneath and ice cream-based cherry balls on top. Generous portions. The wine list is impressive, deep and with honest mark-ups. The arduous choice fell on a refined and structured Inferno della Valtellina Superiore ""La Cruus"" docg of 2018 14.5% of Mamete Prevostini, a pure Nebbiolo (€ 45.00). Pastries offered: cherry macarons, ugly but good with hazelnut and liquorice and mou candy.

2024-04-16,Jack,"Picture a residential neighborhood where you would probably not start a restaurant; then picture a street in that neighborhood where you would be quite unlikely to start a restaurant. That is however precisely where this three-star restaurant is located. The philosophy behind it all, just as the fully zen private dining rooms with tatami mats - I assume - is the full and undivided focus should be on the dinner. And: it delivered. The food is season bound and, at times, surprising. While some of the dishes we had were ‘just’ great Japanese food, two of the twelve dishes we had were truly magnificent.   With respect to the  sake and wine pairing we had; the sake was lovely (as a non-sake expert) and we enjoyed the wine (although other Michelin star restaurants may certainly have better wines).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r946927058-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

We were led to a private room where we were served dish after dish of beautiful and delicious plates in perfect tune with the terroir of the Osaka region.    The menu follows traditional Kaiseki format and our servers kindly explained the significance of the different components in each dish as it relates to the current season.  We made our reservation on the MyConcierge website (my first time doing this) and everything went very smoothly.

2019-09-22,O Tter,"I have developed the theory that very good restaurants are frequently divisive. There will be many diners that love a good restaurant and leave glowing reviews. Others will simply not like the concept and, having potentially paid a very great deal of money for an experience that did not hit the spot, will leave poor reviews. Looking at a couple of recent reviews for Kashiwaya, it seems that this is the case here.  For my part, this is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten in. As my son said, it would almost be worth the journey from London to Osaka simply to visit this restaurant. It is expensive but, equally, you get what you pay for.  As far as I could see, the restaurant comprises a collection of private dining rooms and we were shown to a delightful space upstairs. Decoration is traditional Japanese with cloth covered walls and a tatami mat floor. The table was close to the floor but was placed over a pit (for want of a better expression ) into which your legs went, so that you could sit very comfortably on the floor.  The service is superb with an amazing sense of ceremony. Each time we were visited, typically by two or three of the staff, the door was slid open and they bowed outside before making their way to the table to serve us. Two of the staff members spoke a fair to good level of English and were perfectly well able to explain the various different courses and sake.  The food is exceptional and fully deserving of three Michelin stars. Inevitably I enjoyed some course more than others but all were good. I especially like the 'moon' theme than ran through the dinner and inspired many of the courses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r711835114-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en
2019-05-22,Natakrit N.,"I went to this restaurant after another 3 stars restaurant Hajime, which I was very happy with. So I expected some surprising tastes and textures but it was a disappointment.  The food didn't worth a detour nor flying to dine here. The food tasted just like it looked. I mean raw fish tastes like raw fish but I expected them to do something with the ingredients and turned out to be something unexpected in terms  of flavors and textures. They tried to serve the best seasonal ingredients using Japanese cooking. No offense but you can imagine authentic Japanese cooking, which tend not to add much flavor to ingredients resulting in very mild flavor food, which I could have it elsewhere in Kyoto. I expected more than this from 3 stars Michelin and I know what kind restaurants to look for now. I love to be excited and surprised.   So if you want an above average authentic Japanese restaurant, this restaurant maybe for you but if you  are looking for something surprising, it's not for you. The decorations were like small old Japanese room and 2 small tables, which could only fit 2 persons and it was a little bit uncomfortable for me but I like how it's a private room. Also it's about 4,200 yen taxi drive from Namba.  The dish I enjoyed the most was in the attachments. It's called Mizumono - Fruit balls with honey jelly. It was a very fun dish with different flavors of peeled fruit balls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r675650495-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,3,en
2018-10-17,JFenton1,"Of all the Michelin Star restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, this was the restaurant we were most excited about. I’m really bummed to have to write this review... On paper, 3 Michelin Stars, Relais Chateaux, $400 per person... It sounded like the meal of a lifetime, right? NOT. The restaurant has many rooms, most of which are tatami floor seating style. We were led to what looked like an interrogation room with a table large enough for 10 people, 2 Western chairs, no artwork on the walls and dated decor. Not even old charm Japanese, just old and frankly creepy. No music and the incessant sliding door opening and closing with a rusted metallic sound... We were totally creeped out. We had to start playing a little background music from our phones to get a some kind of atmosphere. Rude of us? Maybe, but I swear, the room had this awful fluorescent lighting, not at all the “cocoon feel” I had read about in the reviews.  THE FOOD: just plain boring. No flavors, nothing exciting at all. Is the Chef so well known that he keeps getting the ratings he received 20 years ago?  The sake/wine tasting at $90 per person consisted of $12 bottles anyone could find at the corner supermarket. Not good at all.  Service was lovely. Therefore my giving the place 2 stars.   We walked out of there, thanked everyone politely and burst into laughter once in the taxi. Never have I spent $900 on a meal for 2 that was so below average. Not to mention the restaurant is a 45 minute drive from the center of Osaka.   SO DISAPPOINTING.

2018-05-23,mike g,"in other words, this will be one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat. why? let me count the ways:  (1) the peaceful setting in a traditional tatami mat room (with a seat and room for legs below the just-above-floor-level table, for the less flexible or more long-legged among us) in a traditional house incongruously next to a freeway in an otherwise quiet mid-north osaka neighbourhood.  (2) the gracious and welcoming greeting on arrival - and, depending on how busy they are, possibly even from grand chef hideaki matsuo and/or his wife proprietress katsuko matsuo.  (3) the unobtrusive, professional yet empathetic service throughout the time at kashiwaya - in our case, for all four hours of our visit.  (4) and, of course, that ""harmonious culinary meditation"" befitting of a restaurant with those coveted three michelin stars...all 12 courses so beautifully designed for the eye, so carefully prepared for the fragrance and flavour and texture.   we were fortunate enough to have visits from the head chef and proprietress during our meal. they kindly explained the back stories involved in choosing the food items and combinations, the preparation and presentation - and the relationship with topics ranging from historical  traditions to the season and even the day's weather.  in the TripAdvisor article i wrote following a visit a year ago i explained more about the back stories and a little bit about the head chef's relationship with food when he's not at the restaurant, so i won't repeat those details here (like his favourite food, and what he does if he's invited out for a meal which wasn't as good as it might have been).   in the attached photo montages of our lunch, i've included the menu we enjoyed - ""Aotsuyu - rain dropping among leaves"" and indeed it was lightly raining that day.   this was only my second three-michelin-star restaurant experience (the other was in paris). but it certainly was an experience to savour, in all senses of the word.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r582321080-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

It was so peaceful in the room and we could not hear any noise outside. The course we chosen was named “Spring morning”. The food was nicely placed on utensils which became pieces of beautiful artwork.  I must mention the  wine pairing.

2018-04-03,Dag I,"Three star restaurants in Japan are always surprising. Either they are chock full of molecular experiments and nordic inspiration (from Noma), or they are very close to something like the traditional Keiseki. This is clearly in the latter category. Al guest are given private rooms, and all are served a set menu consisting of 12-14 courses. A drinking pairing consisting mostly of top notch sake is highly recommended. Tables are traditional in the low style, but there is room for legs underneath, so have no fear of sitting straight on the floor. The food is served at a calm pace, brought by three waiters in traditional dresses. Food is traditional, praising the spring and cherry blossoming when we were there, but with some interesting twists. The whole seance takes almost three hours, but gee how fast time passes. At 90000 + yen for two persons, it is not exactly cheap, but this is not the place to visit if you are on a tight budget.

2017-07-28,mike g,"“Hassun: Conger eel cooked in sake, pickled Japanese ginger, green taro stem, simmered octopus with jade cucumber with ginger vinegar and macrophyll oil [from a type of leaf found in ferns and seed plants], fresh urchin, squid stings, Japanese green leaves.” That was just one of the 12 courses on offer when I visited Osaka’s Kashiwaya, with its three Michelin stars. Japanese food is famous for its fascinating and healthy variety. And nowhere is this more evident than at Kashiwaya. So hearing the backstory about a restaurant and its food can really enhance the dining experience. Hideaki Matsuo, 53, Proprietor and Grand Chef, and his wife Katsuko, Proprietress, earned their third Michelin star in 2011. They opened a sister restaurant in Hong Kong in 2015 and by last year it had already received its first Michelin star. One of the signature dishes is “fluffy” melt-in-your-mouth lobster. Chef Matsuo uses the shell in the broth and steams it for a long time. It took him six hours to come up with this dish, from inspiration to completion.  He develops dishes according to the seasons and also tradition. For example, with the approach of a hot summer, in old times the Japanese emperor gave away ice to his subjects to beat the summer heat and wish them good health. So when summer approaches Kashiwaya serves dishes that reflect this tradition with, for example, the appearance of ice. Unsurprisingly Matsuo is both head chef at the restaurant and also head chef at home, where he likes to prepare everyday food that’s quick and easy to cook.  He often chooses dishes his mother made – and takes photos of them to send her to show he still cooks what she made for the family. His favourite food? Fried prawns.  When friends invite the couple for a meal, even if it’s basic food what matters to them are the fresh ingredients and preparation, the intention to provide a good meal. Even if the food happens to be bad, Matsuo said he has been taught never to leave anything on the plate. At Kashiwaya, guests also never leave anything on their plates. But for all the right reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1023474-d9621651-r506612572-Kashiwaya-Suita_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,5,en

You will have a stylish and traditional Japanese room to yourself , even if you are on your own .  The hospitality one receives right at the start indicates probably something special is coming . And there it appears , a few minutes later . The smiles and courtesy of the few Japanese girls serving you are unbeatable.  The first course will melt you already , not quite because of the taste , texture and material used , but also due to the artistic presentation .  What comes afterwards convince you that Michelin doesn't give 3 stars easily and your taste buds and eyes are constantly entertained to the utmost .  A dish with jelly and shrimps inside was actually outshone by the arrangement and the color of the food as well as the design of the ceramics . The whole presentation glows and one keeps on wondering how so much time and effort have been spent on just one dish .   The overall price ( without counting the sake ) is around Yen 25000, a most reasonable amount when one considers that the ambience , service , food , arrangement and effort put into the show are superb .

We have never had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant so thought we would take the opportunity and visit.  From our arrival being met at the bottom of the stairs, we were treated like long lost best friends, very spoiled and very loved :) The food was sensational and the service was spectacular. We booked a table at the open kitchen bench which was fab so we chatted to Chef Jimmy all the way through every course.

2023-12-25,Michael U,"Recently reopened after an extensive renovation PRU focuses on ""community-to- fork"" gastronomy from Chef Jimmy Ophorst, a location just steps from Phuket's most exclusive resort affording visitors a luxury experience previously unavailable in the area.  An acronym for “Plant. Raise. Understand.,” Jimmy and his team going to great lengths in explaining why Ingredients are chosen and how they are showcased, guests are welcomed in the lobby where Thai Sparkling Wine begins a progressive tasting that soon proceeds to a fully open kitchen.   A short ride from Phuket’s top Resorts, nearby Trisara playing host to a modern building with on-site gardens, it is in the lobby that diners nibble on small bites including a Kimchi Pancake before taking a front and center seat in front of chefs that are friendly and engaging.  Truly a celebration of Thailand’s bounty, Ophorst willfully choosing unique ingredients, course one places Durian amidst Shiso and Caviar with spectacular results before moving onward to a slice of Giant Travelly perfumed by  Ceylon Oak that grow 50 meters above the ground.  Obtaining many ingredients from co-owned PRU Jampa Farm, 1.6 hectares of organic soil available for tours, Bread arrives with too much (IE just enough) local Butter prior to Black Crab Curry given complexity by Tea and a Fennel Bulb baked in Pastry atop Sauce bolstered by Vanilla.  A bold and concise sort of cuisine, no extraneous additions but every dish an expression of the Chef with faultless cooking, Coral Grouper is perhaps the most straight-forward presentation of the night – especially in comparison to Squid in Blue Cheese with laminated Rolls to sop up the excess.   Finishing savories with rosy Duck Breast in a peppered Sauce as complex as Mole it is by way of Guava Granita heated by Pepper that the palate is cleansed en route to Banana with Salted Plum and Citrus.  Back to the lounge to finish, four Mignardises followed by Coffee and Chocolates, PRU may only currently hold 1* from Michelin but the cooking achieves at a 2* level with 3* aspirations and the means to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r930987554-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en

After an appetizer in the lounge, we were escorted to our table at the kitchen counter. From that moment on we were able to see the whole kitchen for the rest of the night. Seeing a kitchen in action at that level is absolutely fascinating. The chef, souschef and entourage explained every dish and its (sometimes unuasal) ingredients.

2023-07-22,Susi Russell-Park,"We dined at PRU last night. We had a cocktail in the bar prior to dinner made by Tus, which was amazing then we had the 5 course tasting menu with premium wine pairing. The service was impeccable especially Alfredo, Chalong and Pla. The food was incredible, very intricate and we enjoyed most of the dishes. There was an amuse bouche that wasn't to my taste at all but that is personal taste nothing to do with quality!  I was beyond amazed and grateful how they catered for myself being allergic to gluten. My dishes were created the same as my husband and super impressive and that is a rarity! You just need to allow the team 48hrs notice to cater for gluten free.  We were also informed on booking regards the dress code 'resort chic' and states no swimwear or flip flops, so we were very disappointed when the table we had to look at all night in front of us had been allowed into the restaurant in beach wear - swim shorts, t-shirt and reef shoes!!! Not what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant at all, cheapens the experience and disappointing that the team did not refuse the guests to enter and enforce their dress code.  We would also feedback that the wine pairing was great but we would have liked the sommelier to elaborate on why each wine was paired with the dishes to give a more detailed and elevated experience.

2023-05-27,nak_lang,"Went last night with a friend and did the 7 courses.  Really happy with it. It may possibly be the best dinner I have ever had.  The asian ingredients were fused seamlessly with western ideas and ingredients. There were nice suprises like 2 amuses before the dinner. A little bag of treats to take home. Interesting bread and butters and a complex palette cleanser towards the end. The portion sizes were pretty good. Our booking was at 7pm and we both had a dish at around 3pm before going so by the end of it we were both happy. If we didn't have the 3pm dish and hung out all day I imagine we would have left a bit hungry. However, in my view it's an experience you are going for, not a big feed. I think if we just opted for the 5 courses it may have perhaps felt a little too light. I would recommend the 7 course. The dishes were all incredibly intricate. I have eaten and worked in michelin starred kitchens in the past and even compared to my past experiences this was very very detailed and intricate food.  I had to put my glasses on to see all the components so I can't imagine trying to plate these up. The flavours and textures were pretty good. I particularly liked how they infused the pea tart with a BBQ flavour. It was phenomenal but I do have some feedback. My friend commented the butters were lacklustre. They wern't bad but I felt the tamarind butter was a little underwhelming and the salted butter tasted like Anchor with salt on top. Could be improved. The main thing was the descriptions. We are both Chefs and do the dinner for a bit of inspiration as well and like to really analyze everything and understand what each component is.  I get the short menu descriptions. I don't particularly like long old school descriptions either. The staff explained each dish pretty well but even asking them to repeat sometimes it is hard to understand and we didn't want to be throwing 20 questions for every dish. I imagine we understood about 70% of what we were eating and a person that's not a Chef probably like 40 or 50%. Maybe a more detailed menu available on request I don't know. Other minor thing was odd questions before the dinner on the phone and during the dinner. ""What hotel are you staying at"". ""Did you come by car or"". Happy to answer. I'm not a secret agent but would be nice to know why they need this information. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed but that's another area they could really do something cool and improve with.  Service for the most part was great. They had a good knowledge of the food they were serving and English was pretty good just a few words we got lost with.  Anyway overall it was a lovely dinner. Total cost for 2 people 7 courses and a few random drinks each was around 20,000 baht.  Certainly worth it if you appreciate the food but if you don't appreciate the food then I wouldn't bother spending so much on a dinner. Look forward to returning in the future if they ever have a new menu to try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r892171354-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en

I have always asked myself if I really need Michelin starred restaurants in Phuket where there is so much food readily available everywhere you turn and the answer is simple, yes you do. Of course you do! Phuket is developing fast and it's only right that Pru is rated so highly. From the start, you know that you are in for something special, the welcome is genuine and the service, food and the location are all spot on.

2022-01-25,Lex Kiefer,"Presentation of all dishes are superbly done, the taste, though, were not to the par.  Concept, services, and presentations are similar to French Laundry in Napa Valley, California; but honestly, not even closed!  Food taste with lack of convictions why they taste the way they should, I find the food as though the chefs wanted to create a highly complexed of inventing Thai food to international discoveries. Sorry to say, I think most of the dishes failed miserably as such!  I remember the time we visited French Laundry several years ago, some of dishes I had I wanted them to linger in my mouth forever. PRU’s creations were far from the mighty sensations.  Service was great, the verbal presentation of both food and wine paring were confusing.  Price  was expensive, at $400 per person for 7 - course meal including wine parring, it wasn’t closed to “wonderfully delicious”.  Wine parring choices were a bit of second or third grade comparing to Napa Valley or French wines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r825904549-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,3,en

We did the 7 course meal with wine pairing and added on the caviar supplement offered. The meal itself included way more than 7 courses - 3 bites as an amuse-bouche, various breads and butters, a beautiful cheese selection of cheeses from all over Thailand (creamy, blue, goat, etc) with jam and honey, a small “pre dessert” of Phuket pineapple and ice cream, and a final tasting of multiple different desserts aside from what was included on the menu.   The duck was amazing. The sauces on the grouper were delicious. My favorite dish (which is hard to choose) was the red mullet with black garlic - had a crispy sour dough crust with delicious sauces.   We left full and incredibly happy - even with a little bag of goodies from the chef! Pricing is on par for a higher end Michelin star restaurant..might even be a tad cheaper than some.

2021-10-25,MGAZH,"After 3 years we went to eat again during our Trisara stay at the Pru. The result was the same as last time: it's pretty good, but nothing special.  In addition the following:  It is fantastic that all the products that are served here come from Thailand and that the cuisine can be described as extremely sustainable.  The products are all very good, the combinations in the dishes are sometimes very good and sometimes not so good. So it was more of a mixed experience. But that's just a matter of taste.  But the following has bothered us: if they commit themselves to sustainability, but at the same time they serve water from Italy, it is more than irritating. If I want to eat sustainably and do this with Thai products, I don't want to drink water that was transported 10,000 km here. This is ecological nonsense. We therefore only ordered good Thai water.  Given the very high prices, one can expect a sommelier to be on hand to advise. that is not the case here.  The staff are very difficult to understand, their English is not too good. But the staff is extremely friendly, that has to be said.  The Thai cheese is extremely good, really. With a view to sustainability, it is very strange that the morning buffet at Trisara serves only imported cheese - I would prefer much the Thai cheese!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r815984790-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,3,en

The food and the experience is as good as the narrative of PRU story - i e what the chef wants to tell us both conceptually but also in every taste created. I went for the 7-course menu, which was not too much at all considering the portion of each course (not a complain). Clearly this is an European style cuisine but definitely inspired by Thai A LOT, for which I enjoyed it very much. Overall I would recommend this however if i can be a bit picky: 2 things didnt work out well for me. 1) the perfume smell of the restaurant and the oshibori/wet towel was too strong till a point I felt bit distracted and annoyed. 2) I would recommend the dish of the wild mushroom can be served later as the taste and smell was fairly strong, which was carried over to my taste for the subsequent course (despite I drank a whole class of water!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1224250-d11913607-r801917299-PRU_Restaurant-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,5,en
2021-07-31,K Wang,"The experience at PRU is great! The food itself isn't the best that I have ever tried, but the service is impeccable and they try hard to live up with their brand on sustainability and connection with ingredients.  As a vegetarian, I always appreciate it that the restaurant can have a dedicated vegetarian menu to ""normalize"" our status instead of just making us trouble makers with special dietary requirement. PRU is doing good with it. :) Before the meal begins, the view outside the restaurant was already a feast to the eye! They also pulled out a special box of ingredients to give a preview on what I will be eating. What I would suggest is that they make a nice e-brochure and attach a QR code with the presentation box so that interested audience can check out more details online. I ordered the vegetarian menu with non-alchoholic drinks for food pairing. The juices come along with the dishes are interesting gem themselves. Too bad that they did not come onto the menu too.  The food came in 5 dishes, plus a P.R.U. signature appetizer, bread to begin with, cheese tasting, pre-dessert, and lastly tea with condiments. I later found out that the cheese and tea came with additional price only when I paid the bill. I don't have a problem with that but they should have told me in advance.   I was a bit surprised when they served bread at the beginning and in fact there is so much food to come. Given the price of the dinner, the bread was definitely the most expensive artisan bread I have ever tried. I was a bit hungry after the ""main dish"" but the ""cheese tasting"" later made me totally full! The waiter introduced various cheese produced in Thailand and I had the chance to taste them all - definitely a dream came true for a cheese lover! The soft ones made from goat cheese were stronger than I would have thought, but I prefer them to the cow cheese ones. At the end when I left, there was also a souvenir of two bottle of jams but I have not tasted them. The hand-written card was sweet too. Overall I think the food was great and all staff endeavored to make it a great experience beyond tastes.

The service is fine, it's about what you'd expect at that price point, but not beyond. Don't go in expecting fun surprises, but your water glass will remain full and your napkin will (usually) be replaced when you get up and go to the bathroom. The food is so jaw-droppingly unremarkable you'll wonder if someone is playing a trick on you. I just finished dining there, and this was the big occasion dining experience of my honeymoon, and no joke the best things I had tonight were some broth and a nice little bite of brown butter ice cream. That's not acceptable at a such a price point. Do I regret going to Maaemo? Obviously, but at the same time, it was kind of funny and inspiring. It makes me want to work harder and now I'm quite certain that if I spent a few months preparing, I too could make a Michelin quality meal.

2024-08-24,Amstraveler,"The hardest lunch choice is what to drink.  I’m normally a fan of pairing wines and Maaemo does what I really like and offers three different quality packages (at three different price levels).  But buying wine in Norway is a bit overextravagant under any circumstances - the NOK 16000 ‘Holy Grail’ pairing, while it would undoubtedly have been divine, was no exception.  Many guests limited themselves to water but we went for a juice pairing which was an unexpected delight.  Mixtures like cherry juice with a hint of nettle and toasted hazelnut were surprisingly successful (especially when pairing a dish with hazelnut in the sauce) - I’ll have a go at making some of the mixtures myself now.  Food (in the 14 courses) mostly superb, some merely very good.  For me the starters and main courses beat the desserts (three ice cream dishes perhaps one too many) with the signature oyster/mussel and king crab/reindeer combos as highlights. Coffee weak. Unlimited water.  Ambience superb, service formal and a little subdued but extremely attentive, around 10 tables each of 1 or 2 people when we were there.  Amusingly we sat next to one gentleman whose vacations consisted mostly of visiting the world’s best restaurants (and told everyone in earshot about his visits).  He felt the restaurant lacked a star performer on the service team (maitre d’ or whatever) which was to him essential in a top restaurant.  Maaemo indeed works with a flat org structure front of house so for someone to whom a star performer out front is critical to their enjoyment - well go elsewhere or forget your prejudice and just enjoy the dishes.  No background music until the last couple of dishes were served.  Prices as advertised - very high; but that’s Norway for you.  Watch out when reservations open - I tried for supper the day of our visit and the restaurant was fully booked half an hour before reservations were supposed to open. Lunch was still available.  Maybe there’s a secret trick that increases your chance of success ….",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r966572767-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,4,en

The non alcoholic pairing was as well a little uninspired and starters (amuse bouche) as well as the sweets towards the end of the dining experience (the parts to be taken on the lower floor) a bit too simple “sweet&fatty” and thus a bit disappointing.

Its predecessor (which won three Michelin stars in 2016 but closed 9 years after its opening) is located above the train tracks leading to Oslo Central Station and is only 300 meters away from the old site.

But since he has spent most of his culinary career in Oslo, his cooking style is to explore the flavors of local Norwegian ingredients.

From start to finish, the staff was kind, friendly, and attentive (we even got to go in the wine cellar when one of our waiters noticed us watching her select multiple bottles). This is our first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant, and it has set the bar high. The attention to detail, not only with paying attention to the guests, but the knowledge about the wine and food being served, was spectacular. So grateful we splurged for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r956344683-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

The taste was exquisite. We have been to other michelin restaurants and this place deserves it’s 3 stars! Service was also impeccable.  It is hard to decide which dish we liked the best because all the dishes from appetizer to dessert had it’s own merits.

2024-02-20,P W 132,"Worst 3 Star ever…overpriced ($500 per person to start).  Food waaaaaaaay below 3 star quality.  Small bites were good, their oyster dish was very fishy, crab too salty, we asked for no mushrooms (and they said yes but had to remind-several times), there was a 30 min gap between one dish, we sent back a glass of merlot that was quite bad (from the Rhone) and rest of dishes very average.  Wine list not up to 3 star restaurant (but reasonably priced…for Oslo)-but we bought a 500$ Mersault which was quite good.  Very nice room.  BIG problem is Chef who thinks he is Guy Savoy (and is not)-they asked for feedback and we mentioned the above and Chef came to our table HOT and berated us-mentioning he did not have a microwave and suggested we could end our dining experience.  We gladly we took him up on that and saved a lot of money.  I have always believed that Norway is a kind and gentile place but when a 6 foot +++ Chef lords over your table and you have in your party one of the only non-white people in the restaurant you have to wonder…sorry Norway but don’t worry Chef is Danish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r939050902-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,1,en

2023-09-17,Michael U,"As the only Michelin 3* Restautant in Norway Maaemo carries a banner, ""Mother Earth"" in Finnish Chef Esben Holmboe Bang serves a menu focused on organic, biodynamic, and raw local ingredients with the end-goal being zero waste but no restrictions in terms of taste or technique.   Found in the Oslobukta neighborhood diners begin and end in the lounge while a high-ceilinged dining room utililzes organic materials and dramatic lighting to draw attention to an open kitchen working in near silence across 15 courses.  Danish by heritage, though Esben’s plates consistently pay homage to Norwegian traditions, it comes as no surprise that Dinner begins with Potato Lompe topped in Cod plus Horseradish before proceeding through bites including Foie Gras, local Cheese and raw Beef topped in Pine Cone Vinegar.  Occasionally giving in to ""New Nordic"" ideals, though Butter and Fat see Maaemo’s flavors trend more rich than its contemporaries, plates in the dining room began with smoked Vendace Roe perfumed by elderflower that paired beautifully to 2020 Benjamin Leroux Chassagne-Montrachet.  Benefited by faultless service, every staff member executing at the highest level of personal yet professional engagement, Scallops arrived next with tart Fruits preceding Bang’s iconic Flat Oyster with Blue Mussels and Dill that has been a mainstay since 2010.  Pulling back in terms of intensity with a subtle plate of Turnips and Nettles, then serving a recently added slice of Char in a complicated Sauce that vacillates from sweet to savory, the night’s “main course” featured half a roasted Quail with Plums and Sunchokes alongside golden Milk Bread and a decorative spread made from Mushrooms with Garlic.  Cleansing the palate with earthy Consomme, bold but nuanced and a good bridge to Dessert placing Rhubarb amidst florals, it is here that diners return to the lounge for Coffee and sweets including Maaemo’s historic Brown Butter Ice Cream and hot, sticky Cinnamon Buns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r917041872-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en

2023-08-12,Connor M,"I had very high expectations for this restaurant based both on how people talk about it as well as their three stars.  Some of the staff were very friendly and some were just rushed and not very attentive.  When the food started coming it was pretty disappointing. Out of 14 courses I really only loved 6.5 of them. The ones that were good were truly spectacular, but to have less than half of the menu be great when you're paying top dollar is just unacceptable.  I really don't understand how they managed to get and retain three stars.  I can't recommend this place unless you're rich and cost doesn't matter much to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r909829411-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,2,en

2022-11-14,reisermedfamilie,"The only trouble with this establishment was finding the entrance, something that took a walk around the block, as we missed it at first glance.  It is discretely located on the corner of a block,  with an unassuming wooden door, where the only clue is a small brass plate above a door buzzer.   Other than that a perfect experience.  We found the difficulty in finding the entrance something to laugh about, not troubling.  Nonetheless, be sure to arrive a bit early, in order to locate the entrance. We appreciated being given a small folder with a  list of all of the courses, once  Once you buzz the door, you enter the vestibule where your coats are taken. Then you proceed to the ""living room"" downstairs, where welcome drinks and the first three to four courses are served.  Beautiful pieces of art to look at!  To describe these starters as an explosion of tastes would not do them true service.  These hors dóuevres are a carefully orchestrated gustatory  symphony of contrasting and complimenting tastes.  Be aware that the champagne costs extra.    After the starters,  you proceed to the dining room on the main floor, where several more courses are served, each one an experience in itself, with balanced combinations of flavours that I would not have imagined.  Each dish was lovely to look at, delightful to tase.  Then it is back to the ""living room"" to wind down with desserts.  The service was excellent, formal and highly attentive, yet still friendly and approachable with any questions.  The staff worked as a well-orchestrated team to ensure that the diners were served their courses with precision, and that any questions were answered. You can watch the cooks make the final preparations with precision.  We were a party of four, where I was the only one to take the wine package, which was very good, but perhaps a bit of a let-down given the price tag.  Nonetheless, I would probably go for the wine pairing again if I did it once more.  Be aware that each glass of wine is for about three courses.  One of the others took two glasses of wine, one white and one red, with the main courses. and were very pleased.  One member of the group  took a non-alcoholic beverage pairing which was remarkably good, an unconventional combination of ingredients that resulted in an impressive drink.  Yes, this experience does costs a small fortune, but it is worth it.  It was impressive on so many levels.  Be aware that this is a set menu.  I doubt that it would appeal to vegetarians or those with special dietary needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r868403022-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en
2022-09-20,123bi456ro789,"I still cannot stop smiling when I think of what a good time we had at Maaemo. The interior, the decor, the atmosphere and last but not least the staff and the FOOD! I had been wanting to go since they opened twelve years ago but somehow I never managed to get a reservation and when I finally did, I had to cancel because of covid. But it certainly was worth the long wait. My husband and I could not even decide which dishes we liked best. Normally, we enjoy the starters, but it’s downhill from there because the main dishes are too large (and boring) when one would prefer to have more, and smaller, dishes to be able to taste more things. Not so here. Everything was perfect. And the dishes included all our favourite foods! We particularly enjoyed the innovative and creative takes on traditional  foodstuffs like the outstanding dish with reindeer hearts as well as the dishes with caviar from different sources. And pinnekjøtt more interesting than any I have had before. And lomper, shrimp, scallops, king crab, mushrooms and strawberries as well as  duck leg, beef, turbot, peas, quail and brioche and rhubarb. Even now, I am unable to say what I liked best. Interesting matching wines, too. And did I mention the outstanding staff? I was smiling all evening. Pure bliss.  Oops, I almost forgot. A good review needs something negative. Mhh, well … I couldn’t eat my second cinnamon bun. In retrospect, I would have loved to take it home. They were quite tasty, after all  Sorry, but this is all the negative I can come up with.

From the fireplace, the furniture, the smell, the pleasant silence even though people were speaking.  And then the food!!

2022-08-08,Mary Ella Feinleib,"I was thrilled to get a reservation at Maaemo, the northernmost Michelin three-star restaurant in the world. I'm sorry to have to say I was disappointed. I expect any three-star restaurant to have pretensions about its food, but I found Maaemo beyond pretentious. The servers were nice enough but so formal that the effect was chilling. First we we were taken to a dimly lit basement room for our starters. I could barely see what I was eating!  As each of the five  one-bite starters were presented, the waiter recited the ingredients--each of the five seemed to have five ingredients!  Precisely one hour later (everything here is timed to the  minute), I and the other diners were escorted up  to the dining room. The decor was stark but attractive and there was was more light here. My waitress stood  at my table and recited the ingredients of each of the eight main courses. Again, she was nice, but stiff. Trying to lighten the mood, I asked, ""So, what's the next course going to be?"" ""Oh, I can't tell you that ahead of time."" (To be fair, she gave me a hint.)  The food itself was generally good, but only a few dishes stood out as excellent--disappointing for a three-star restaurant. And  I'm all for innovative food pairings, but the ""shoulder of crab with reindeer heart"" took this concept a bit over the top. I must say that every course was artistically plated. An hour and a half later, to the second, it was downstairs again, for dessert. I enjoyed most of the desserts more than I had enjoyed the starters.   Half an hour later came the check, which was exorbitant, but not inappropriately so. This was not my favorite restaurant meal, but it was my most interesting restaurant experience.

2022-07-11,DvA,"There are very few restaurants in the world that take your breath away when you enter them because you realise: This is something special, something magical! Maaemo definitely is one of them. Within the first few minutes of entering the building, chatting with the staff, and climbing downstairs to the living room, you realise you are in for an unforgettable night. Maaemo has a unique, elegant and focused but still very cosy style. It elevates your mood immediately. And the food is right up there with the very best in the world: Every single one of the small bites served in the living room at the beginning of the meal is spectacular in all preparation, presentation, and taste. Entering the main dining room upstairs is another wow moment. It is one of the most beautiful restaurant settings I have seen, with an impressive open kitchen, a fire place, and spectacular art on all walls of the very high room. Throughout the meal, the interactions with staff and the quality of food are kept at highest level. The absolute highlight of our menu was a filet of line caught Norwegian salmon that was by far the best piece of fish I have ever tasted. It had nothing in common with the regular salmon you get in other restaurants or supermarkets. With its perfect combination of a light sea taste, seductive fat layers, and creamy texture it seemed to come from a different world. After that, the main course of the menu was the only disappointment of our visit: A piece of lamb, proudly presented at the table before being roasted over the grill, had barely any taste. An anticlimax to an otherwise flawless meal. The night at Maaemo ends with delicious friandises and coffee (roasted and brewed to perfection on-site) served downstairs again. The cinnamon buns are so good that you should seize the opportunity and take a few extra ones with you to enjoy the next day. This is one way of prolonging this fantastic experience for a few more hours. The memories, however, will stay forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190479-d2447055-r847291755-Maaemo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,5,en
