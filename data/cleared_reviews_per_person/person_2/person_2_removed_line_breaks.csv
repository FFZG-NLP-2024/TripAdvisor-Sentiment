2023-09-10,qscofr1,Really my expectations was high and it was according it. I feel a great place with a great rustic environment but with amazing surprises on the food and amazing set of glasses and dishes.  We have a chance to see how everything was prepared and I can describe how good was everything. This kind of food is not the daily one but it is a composition of flavours combined with textures on a proper way moving to a new way. Probably will come back on important moments on my life because really everything was perfect.   ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r915797481-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en

2018-12-27,Vinhoquevale,The restaurant is just a couple of miles outside of Pamplona. It is located in the countryside. Peaceful atmosphere. Amazing to arrive at the table and meet only napkins (and nothing more). The lights are well positioned. The menu degustación is incredible. The milk biscuits with truffled icecream closes the experience. It combines tradition and vanguard. Amazing. Service top-notch.

2018-11-03,ArthurWang095,"I come here at least once a year. It surprises me every time with great & new gourmet & service. It makes a lot sense & reason why it is Michelin starred for more than 10 years consecutively from the gourmet creativities as well as wine pairing. This time I have too many new dishes plus the signature ones. The sardine in all forms with rosemary smoke, the molecular scallops, the goose liver with cauliflower paste & sauce, truffle with slow cooked pI grin and the signature vinegar cucumber & molecular oyster. The ending ice cream surprised us by its combination of tea sorbet & many flavors. Service is perfect with great explanation. Definitely always an adventure & enjoyment in its gastronomy tour.  很多年了，一年至少來一次。每次來都因為新菜和一流服務而大為驚訝，難怪是超過十年的連年得獎米其林餐廳，因為他創意又紮實的美食、配酒和服務，這次又都是新菜，沙丁魚解構後配上rosemary的煙，分子解構的帶子，鵝肝配上白花椰菜湯及醬，松露佐低溫烹調的鴿子肉，還有他著名的醋黃瓜和蚵仔氮氣粒，甜點的冰淇淋也讓我們驚豔因為加上茶的冰沙和其他味道而超好吃又不甜，服務一流，說菜完美，每次來都變成美食的探索和非常享受。 ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r630484040-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en

2016-10-18,Matt_Dina,"This place is a little outside Pamplona but if you have a car and like adventurous starred cuisine, it is well worth a visit. We had the menu and got 12 courses. El Molino really cares about the presentation so all dishes are just stunning. The cook knows his stuff: some dishes are classic nouvelle cuisine - probably to show that he can also do boring - but most courses are experimental, molecular cuisine. Some of the experiments were not really my thing (the pinewood smoked foie was too much resiny to supplement the buttery richness of the foie) but many other dishes were revelations. Little frozen green pearls that taste like mussels/oysters to name just one aspect of a marvellous dish where leek (!) plays the leading role. The drinks are not included. Their bread is great. They say they make it themselves but I have a feeling they get it from this wonderful bakery in Gorraiz...

2016-04-19,martinezcm,"There are three Michelin starred restaurants in Pamplona. This one just a couple of miles North (a short cab drive) maybe the best. It is in the countryside with easy free parking in an old refitted stone building by the roadside. Do not let the simple stone building  fool you. Inside is one of the best restaurants in the whole central Pyrennees. They have a fix price menu with perhaps too many servings but also have a short carte with outstanding offering of classical regional dishes refined without bizarre touches of molecular cuisine. Their smoke foie is the best example.You cannot miss with either the fish or meat choices. The wine selection is very good and the prices reasonable, for this type of restaurant. Only the prices of the dessert choices were out of proportion to their content. Otherwise the modernized rustic interior and the efficient service make the experience a most pleasant scape from the noise and cramped quarters of the other good choices withing Pamplona city limits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r365337005-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en
2015-07-08,Jason M,"I came to Pamplona during the festival of San Fermin, but running the bulls, although a MUST experience, was not the highlight of our trip.  The Mill at Urdaniz claims that honor.  Chef David Yarnoz is BRILLIANT!  We were greeted at the door by Javier and Isabella, and the welcome could not have been warmer.  We were given a choice of seating and selected the more formal dining area upstairs.  The menu was in Spanish, and we as American tourists were lacking in that area, so the Chef sent a young sous chef to our table to translate.  As a party of six, all but one selected the tasting menu priced at 70 Euros.  The courses that followed were the highlight of our trip.  Isabella, the matron of the establishment (and I surmise the mother of the talented Chef David Yarnoz) was gracious to a degree that I have never experienced as a patron.  There was a language barrier for us and she and the wait staff assisted in a way that one would have expected at a place like Charlie Trotter's if you were Spanish and spoke no English.  Every detail was covered and we all felt like the whole team pulled together to ensure our experience was exquisite, and it was.  All of the courses were regionally designed to make it a true local gastronomic experience, and if I ever return to Pamplona this will be the first thing I book.  The charming old mill is located approx. 20 minutes outside of town, and it provided us with a wonderful opportunity to take a step back from the hectic atmosphere of San Fermin and spend a quiet evening among friends, one that will never be forgotten.  Great wine, Excellent food, and an atmosphere conducive to a long social meal with friends.  Thank you Chef David, Isabella, and Javier for adding so much value to our Pamplona experience of a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g6412760-d3584780-r286983146-El_Molino_de_Urdaniz-Urdaniz_Navarra.html,5,en

We reserved for lunch on Easter Sunday. It was a dreary day when we left Pamplona and headed up into the hills, you follow the National road which heads toward the French border. The restaurant is located on the bend before you enter the village of Urdaniz. A quaint stone build, which must have been the Windmill in a former life. Inside, downstairs there is a local restaurant, which was doing a brisk trade.  The more formal area is upstairs, with its exposed beams, neutral tones, it is a pleasant environment for what was an excellent lunch. From the gin & tonic starter, which melted on the tongue to the wonderfully chocolate laden dessert, there were some courses which could be described as ""samey"", on the whole the meal was excellent, the service charming, unobtrusive & knowledgeable.

The explanation is brief, but complete, they do not give you an existential talk of the motivations of the cook when it comes to inspiration, it is simply haute cuisine, technique purified by years of work and an obvious commitment, for good doing. Delight in each of the 14 passes, in a very well-kept environment, with Top-rated ingredients in the area.  The dishes are the protagonists, arrive at the table well timed, served professionally, direct from the kitchen you have in sight.  David Yárnoz, was there and kindly called (with great subtlety) our son, to show him in situ, how he gets one of his most memorable dishes.

Not in vain, it is the only restaurant in the world with two Michelin stars (that I know of) that does not offer different appetizer passes, live dishes or in the kitchen and all the paraphernalia of this type of restaurant.

2024-07-20,Smudger,"On arrival  they told us not to look at the menu they gave us which was waxed closed as it is a surprise experience. Sadly, it wasn’t the experience we were expecting as 13 of the 15 courses were vegetarian which we did not expect. Don’t mind some vegetarian courses but not 90 %. The paired wines included 8 wines of which 6 were unfiltered which again one or two unfiltered would be fine hence not what we were expecting. Portion sizes were off the scale poor and even the flavour and quality of produce was way below expectation mostly bland. Having eaten in many Michelins  based restaurants .. 360 and Proto in Dubrovnik, Sukaldean and Bernard Extea in San Sebastien to name a few where quality of food and overall experience was truly Michelin. This experience was sadly our worst experience of a Michelin based restaurant hence fell way below expectation as food is a key element of any dining experience which was unbelievably poor in this case. Given we were in Hungary we expected some form of Goulash would have been on the menu given claims of local produce!! The only plus was the service. Finally, the price was staggeringly  out of sync with the food quality and wines hence as much as I hate to say it, it was a complete ripoff as one of the courses was bread n butter to fill us up as the previous and future courses would have left us still hungry.

2024-03-31,Koltrip,"Not sure what to rate this fine dining restaurant. From you enter you are taking very good care of. Everything works very good. During the 15 courses which I think is a bit exaggerated because some of the ""dishes"" are so small that you almost can't taste them, we had 2-3 highlights. The bread for 1 of the dishes was maybe the best bread ever eaten. The mushroom dish was also very good. Rest of the dishes was average and a couple was not tasty. When it comes to the wine paring, we had local wines, there were many highlights. We had one small dish we couldn't eat and to be honest at this level of dining we expected that they would come up with some extra for us but they didnt. Overall a good experience but many of the dishes are too small. Myself I just get irritated to get dishes that are at this size. So maybe based on the price and expectations of this kind of restaurant it should get a 3/5 but the wine paring gives it a 4/5. 210.000 forint are expensive for a couple.

2023-11-12,Zesty1,"Exquisite and indulgent - but the multiple courses were all very clean, with a focus on local ingredients, and they had a vegetarian option for my wife which made this place stand out.   First off we did find it slightly uncomfortable (it's not a discreet dining experience, but rather interactive, with tables near each other and facing to the open room, and other couples within earshot). The  requisite presentation was a little florid, and they make a lot of spectacle about the chef's personal stories etc - but they did a good job with it overall. Waiters didn't always look comfortable standing around either but they were speedy and the service was good.  Eventually we did get into the swing of things and relaxed a bit during the meal (helped by excellent local natural wines and lemonades).  Not cheap but also not on the crazy side of the price spectrum of Michelin restaurants. It appeared that this was the most sustainable of them all in Budapest, which I also appreciated. Recommended.

2023-06-22,Michael U,"Opened in 2019 SALT is considered by many to be Budapest's best Restaurant, its location in a boutique hotel called RUM featuring warm wood tones surrounding an open kitchen with most plates finished at a pass in front.  Led by Chef Szilárd Tóth and Manager Máté Boldizsár with service comparable to the world’s best, many dishes telling a tale of Hungarian heritage, SALT relies on ideas akin to “new Nordic” fare with foraging and fermentation at the forefront while Beverages look to local or natural Wines plus Juices made to pair.  A “story-teller’s” tasting, fifteen courses plus additions on both ends delivered at an appropriate pace, it is with Kombucha that guests are invited to taste a bundle of Herbs dragged through Carp Milt plus Celeriac and Fish in a Tuile before moving on to blanched White Asparagus lent acidity by a Dip of Nettles and Ants.  Plated Scandinavian but distinctly Hungarian in terms of terroir, one-bite “Greasy bread” hearty but balanced with Eel instead of Jowl Bacon, Cauliflower comes charred next to Walnut Cream that leads well into Cheese topped with micro-planed Pork Heart.  Contemporary with roots in local ingredients and rural dishes, the casual environment adding to the sense of dining at a friend’s house, Tóth’s “Chicken of the Woods Mushroom” comes in aromatic Corn Miso prior to a refreshing “Gin & Tonic” Bite composed in the kitchen.  Choosing another Juice going forward, Lime and Strawberry accented by Bay Leaf holding up to Soup and Bread made for dipping, a second plate in the same vein references a peasant dish from Pécs rethought with Foie Gras and Duck Heart in hearty Broth.  Pumping the breaks with raw local Trout in an ice bowl, acidic like Aguachiles but lacking Chiles, Potatoes in Duck Fat proves to be an elegant setup for sticky Pork Ribs intended to be eaten as a Lettuce Wrap topped in fermented foraged Greens.   Outpacing the single Michelin Star received in 2021, a Cheese course adjacent Chestnut Honey and Pine transitioning to sweet, SALT’s Rice Pudding with Chamomile is an exercise in restraint that fully engages the palate before finishing with floral Matcha and a quartet of Petit Four.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r896865619-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en

2023-05-08,YoshiDus,Absolutely amazing experience and most probably under my top 5 of best restaurant meals ever. Almost every dish was perfect. Service was top notch. Make sure you get a table that allows full view of the kitchen. Despite our early reservation months before we first got seated at a large table in the back but upon complaining politely we switched towards a kitchen view table. Amazing and worth 2 Michelin stars IMO. Would travel to Budapest only to eat here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r889559246-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en
2023-05-07,geterd0ne,"Deserving of all the attention and praise from it's star. All the courses were beautifully presented with attention to detail and the service was perfectly choreographed. With prior warning during our reservation, they delivered a extravagant vegetarian course for one person in our party.   The menu changes seasonally and has a lot of fermented flavors, and less obsessive about heavy fats as compared to other fine dining. It's a long tasting menu and paced to fill you up. We opted away from the wine pairing and they offered a delightful pairing of homemade juices. Some of the juices were highly unorthodox, but each was immaculately paired to the uniqueness of the course in front of you.   My only negative opinions would be the chef is leaning-in on the sustainability angle a little too hard in the protein department. Also for a 3.5-4 hour seating, the chairs they are using for their 2-person tables is woefully inadequate in the comfort department. The service, glassware, and presentation were all multi-star experience, but the soft touches seemed to be lacking.   All considered they delivered exactly on what they promised and we'll be back.

2023-04-21,Zesty1,"I came to Salt with my girlfriend just to try it out, and we were blown away. We don't always enjoy stuffy, regimented fine dining experiences, but our initial apprehension (we had just seen the movie the Menu, and were reminded of this) was immediately suppressed by the quiet courtesy and professionalism of the staff, and a stunning sequence of dishes that catered to both of us (my girlfriend is a vegetarian, and the vegetarian versions of the menu delivered completely too).  For this, I specifically wanted something that focused on sustainable food, farm to table, or a cuisine that didn't make me feel like I was eating somewhere that was importing lobster from Maine into a landlocked country over thousands of miles. This reminds more of the style of modern Scandinavian cuisine, with very pure and earthy flavors, local produce and meat, and the chefs and various servers presented a story with each course that reflected the desire for homegrown fare, and also completely delivered.   I can't really describe a standout dish - I can only say that dish after dish was completely delicious, and oftentimes hitting the peak of flavor combinations that made our brains go mushy with euphoria.   It's the best restaurant I have tried in Budapest. It is certainly an expense (roughly 400-500 euro for 2 people), but if you are into a full, hours-long food experience it, it is worth the money and the time.   My one criticism was the layout of the place - as I diner II felt somewhat exposed and at first uncomfortable, rather than tucked into a romantic or private space with a partner, even with the view of the kitchen, which was very nice.

2022-09-20,#rooftopfoodie,"Salt is a fairly new Budapest establishment and a worthy Michelin-star holder. It is small with only ten tables so booking well in advance is the only chance to enjoy a meal here. The fixed menu relies on Hungarian traditions and many special local ingredients, many coming from the village where the chef grew up. It also includes many unusual ingredients for Hungarian kitchen such as snails once favored by wealthy noble families and now extinct from tables. For foreigners probably best to visit with a Hungarian who undoubtedly will relate many childhood stories to some of the food served. The wines in the wine pairing are mostly biodynamic and natural so unless favoring such flavours, probably better to choose from the wine menu. A truly memorable experience that is best begun or ended in the rooftop bar of the hotel where the restaurant also is located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g274887-d19095453-r861030238-Salt-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,5,en

Good and very friendly waiter and a pleasant serving speed. The restaurant definitely deserves its stella (star). Wine book was incredible and our choice of 2008 Ronco del Re Sauvignon was perfectly fitting the menu.

The Michelin guide's description is perfect:  “The dishes, beautiful for the eyes and exquisite for the palate, are complex and elaborate, but never unnecessarily artificial.” I noted only one flaw, which was also annoying: the sommelier waiter. Unlike foods, it is ""unnecessarily artificial."" He expresses himself with a tone of voice that is not suited to the freshness of the place and the food, with a vocabulary that is completely out of place (""let's start playing with this wine...""). Added to this, unfortunately, is the quantity of drink needed for each glass, well below the 10cc which would be the minimum dose required by law. The timeliness of the service compared to the courses also left something to be desired.

2023-07-22,Playapepper,"We were very hopeful upon seeing the dining room and roof deck and the space was light, open, sensual and inviting. Next, the show stopper was the amuse-bouche, which offered a delightful and exotic trip for the palette.  Unfortunately, this inspiring beginning was the best part of the night for us.   The head waiter was unwelcoming and hurried and no other person in the restaurant engaged with our table. For a place that rests it's entire philosophy on time and slowness, our dinner could not have been more of the antithesis.   After traveling throughout Italy and Switzerland and visiting some of the best restaurants, each experience we had prior to Horto was some of the most stunning displays of hospitality and culinary excellence.  In our other restaurants experiences throughout Europe both sommeliers and servers took their time and demonstrated pride in offering us creative narrative, ingredient explanations, and notes and history of the wine. We experienced none of this care, enthusiasm, or passion at Horto. For a very expensive check we paid for the bare minimum without any of the hospitality one expects from a Michelin rated restaurant.    Additionally, a storm came during our dinner and while I understand that this is a change of course for the restaurant, it was as if it was their first time encountering this event. One would hope that the weather is a well-ironed aspect of how the establishment plans their operation given the roof. We ended up waiting sometimes 30 minutes between courses and our evening ended up starting at an 8pm seating, and ending at 12 midnight. We found several of the courses to be bland, unseasoned, and in some cases inedible.   It was a disappointment to end our trip this way. If you are looking for a fantastic culinary experience in Milan, visit Felix Lo Basso's restaurant. You will not be disappointed.

2024-09-14,Paul,"We were looking forward to a nice lunch experience at a star restaurant, but that was disappointing. The food was quite tasty, but not exceptional and in our opinion not qualitatively comparable to other star restaurants we have been to, but the service was downright mediocre. Therefore the low review. There were two of us. Allergy from one person passed on in advance, but was not asked which of the two. Meat cleaver gehannes put with fish dish and vague wine advice. After forty-five minutes when most of the other tables had started earlier, the music went out and there were hardly any staff. Refilling water was not done and whether we still wanted wine was not asked. Dessert was served without drink advice while all glasses were empty. Therefore I asked for a sparkling wine myself that we had also received at the start, but we were recommended another wine that was put on the bill for € 35 per glass without further explanation. At the end, we felt a little robbed. A lunch for two people for € 385 with a very mediocre service. You don't have to think about what the service would be like if we had booked another half hour later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187849-d24960819-r969705113-Horto-Milan_Lombardy.html,1,en

Entrance from the creepy Medelan: deserted lobby... luckily there are pretty clear signs indicating where to go to take the elevator to the restaurant. At the exit of the elevator no one to welcome, you have to find your way alone. We are finally shown the table that I must say has a really impressive view, and the decor of greenery and plants is remarkable. Food for me incomprehensible and forgettable, tiny portions and waiting times between courses too long. Lovely service from a very willing young staff.

Good but not ""magical"" dishes, the risotto is what I appreciated the most. Negative note, the noise: the location is fantastic, it overlooks the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele but the noise echoes in the restaurant and it feels like being in a pizzeria (without taking anything away).

However, for a 3* restaurant, the ambiance and experience leave much to be desired.  We were seated in a small, cramped basement.  For me or my wife to rise from the table, the waitstaff had to come and move the table so we could get up.  There were plenty of times when our water or wine glasses ran dry, the crumbs were not cleaned from our tablecloth, my wife's napkin wasn't folded when she left the table, and several other minor things that would not matter at all were we not used to better experiences at other 3* places.

2024-05-23,Helmut,"NOTE: the rating given is relative to other 3 Michelin star restaurants I have eaten at worldwide.   Alain Passard is a genius when it comes to flavors. To me, this was the 3-star surprise of the evening: At times underwhelming looking dishes that, when tried, were an explosion on the palate. Using freshly-farmed in-season vegetables are key to the flavors. The chef merely combines them in the most perfect way. Still, I expected more out of the ordinary for a 3-star restaurant and, to be honest, some dishes – based on looks and technique – would easily be served at any average restaurant. Take for example the salad. Completely unassuming until you try the dressing. A shout out goes to the bread, because it was truly amazing. As such, I am a little torn here with my rating and will knock off one point.   The place is tiny but with a cute decor. However, the compact place also means a lot of traffic from the service staff. As there is no loop through the dining area, there is no way for the staff to move graciously between the tables. This means often staff leaving some guests unattended. My biggest complaint was in regard to the front of house timing. Someone would bring out a plate from the kitchen. It would be placed on a cart for inspection. It often would sit there alone, unattended, until the right server would spot it, pick it up and deliver it. Pretty poor communication if you ask me. Even worse, more than once was I sitting dry with food on the plate and no wine in the glass. The wine and food timing was completely off.   Other small mistakes, such as not adjusting my napkin after I excused myself for the wash room, a slice of bread that was put on my plate and then taken back to the tray after I declined on more bread, and the fact that my coat could not be found are mistakes that should never happen in a 3-star place. It is clear to me that the chef lives in his kitchen, but front of house are running around without clear marching orders or supervision. For this I am knocking off another point.   If you love food and amazing flavors and can look beyond some of the front of house faux pas, then by all means do not skip L'Arpege. But if you are a stickler expecting crazy dishes that wow you visually it is best you stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r951997329-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,3,en

2024-04-28,vincybie,"  Recently, my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to dine at the renowned three Michelin star restaurant, Arpège in Paris. As vegetarian on that day, we were excited to explore the vegetarian-friendly options this establishment had to offer. However, our experience fell short of our expectations due to various factors that left us feeling dissatisfied and overcharged.  Unwelcoming Start:  Upon our arrival, we found the restaurant door closed, After peering inside, we noticed someone standing there, seemingly aware of our presence. To our surprise, the lady asked us to return 30 minutes later as the restaurant was ""not ready"" , leaving us feeling unwelcome.   The Price Shock:  While waiting, we decided to pass the time at a nearby café. Curiosity led us to browse the restaurant's website, where we discovered the exorbitant prices associated with each dish, particularly the set menu. The steep cost gave us pause and ultimately led us to contemplate canceling our reservation. Unfortunately, we discovered that the cancellation fee was a staggering 1000 Euros, leaving us feeling trapped.  Underwhelming Main Course:  Once seated and served, we found that the complimentary appetizers were the highlight of our meal. However, I was disappointed by the limited options for vegetarian main courses. The sole vegetarian dish I chose resembled the complimentary raw vegetable platter we had, albeit cooked and caramelized. Regrettably, it tasted more like a warm dessert rather than a satisfying savory main course. It was disheartening to leave my main dish unfinished, especially considering the hefty price tag of 155 Euros for a plate consisting of only ten small pieces of steamed vegetables. This is not the first time I had vegetarian dishes at 1 to 3 Michelin Star world wide.   Lackluster Dessert Experience:  Despite expressing our fullness to the server, we were persuaded to order two kinds of desserts to share. We requested half-sized portions, but even then, we were unable to finish a single dessert. The unappetizing experience with the desserts further contributed to our overall dissatisfaction. In an attempt to minimize waste, we decided to take the complimentary desserts with us and later gifted them to a homeless woman with a beautiful dog the following day.  Unpleasant Surprise:  As we were preparing to leave, to our astonishment, our table server opened a new bottle of water without seeking our consent. The additional charge for the unrequested water was an unwelcome surprise, further adding to our growing disappointment.  Conclusion:  Our experience at Arpège, though highly anticipated, turned out to be a letdown.

I was seated with Simon, the waiter, and he and the kitchen went above and beyond....the food was PURE ART and the taste of the many dishes was PURE HEAVEN!!!!  I knew I was in a rarefied culinary world when ordering herbal tea, they wheeled in pots full of gorgeous herbs for me to select.  my main plate was scallops encased in bay leaves with a lobster sauce.

2024-01-30,Barbara J,"My husband and I dined at Arpege on 26th Jan to celebrate my 50th birthday. Unfortunately, the diner is memorable for its utter mediocrity.  I was reluctant to try L'Arpege given its mixed reviews and should have followed my instinct. We dined at the one star Qui Plume la Lune the previous night and it was superb. I don't normally write reviews but would like to prevent others – especially vegetarians –  from bothering with this tired lazy restaurant. I have been a vegetarian for 38 years and dined in many 3 star, 2 star and 1 star restaurants throughout the world so feel qualified to judge L'Arpege. The service was unfocused and casual to the point of sloppy (wine glasses were uncleared, service was not attentive etc.) The menu was what one might expect from a farm restaurant in that the produce was good quality but sloppy in presentation and not remotely creative in combination of flavours.The vegetarian selection of dishes (there is no vegetarian set menu option any more) did not cohere  together. The chef seems to expect diners to be impressed by his egg starter that he's been serving for nearly 30 years. Haute vegetarian dining has moved on. Diners should too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r936120759-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,1,en
2024-01-18,Fab',"Extremely creative cuisine. As expected for a proper 3-stars, you get transported in a unique world, in the chef's vision. For many things, you can't tell if it's good or if it's bad, simply because this is something you've never experienced nor tasted before. You just drop a tear and you ask for more.  The servings are very generous and even for a large eater like me, finishing the meal was becoming a challenge.  The service is extremely classy and professional, as well as the attire of the servers. As expected, the wine list is telescopic and only the help of the sommelier can properly guide you through the best pairing.  We will point the attention brought to single travelers who are greeted with a comic book explaining the chef's vision, work and the dishes. That makes time fly.  The imitation of the classic ""sauce beurre blanc"" (white butter sauce) is extraordinary. I only experienced such experiment in another 3-stars.  Overall, all aspects of the French cuisine are here and mastered: vegetables, plants, meat, fish, traditional, modern, creative, etc… and all is well executed. No molecular cuisine or nitrogen artefacts here. In fact, what surprises the most is that the dishes seem so simple and the list of ingredients seem so short that you feel you could do it yourself; only until you taste what is presented to you. Another thing that surprises is that ingredients that seem not to go together are married, and the result is out of this world.   The lower room I was in is decorated with real flowers put on a wall looking like a painting canvass. Never seen before and you can spend long minutes looking at it in details.  You clearly are in the world of an artist who's very dedicated. For example, one of the components of one of the starters is turnip. The chef has experimented the same turnip seed, planted at the same time in 3 of his gardens disseminated across this part of France, and then found out that the end-result will give 3 different products. Based on that he will choose what seems to be the best for him.  The old-time hot-cold egg is a wonder of creativity and craftsmanship by the mastery of required technicality for the cooking, and perfect timing for the serving; indeed, if you wait too long for eating it, the surprising hot-cold effect is no longer there.  If there is one small negative thing to mention: be warned that you have to park yourself. No valet, no dedicated parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r934576453-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en
2023-11-11,Mehdi M,"I would recommend the restaurant for its food. I came to the Arpege to taste the vegetables of Alain Passard, and I am not disappointed.    - The plate of amuse-bouche made of slide root vegetables and little shells was simple but well presented. The taste was on point. - The classic Arpege egg was delicious as expected. - Another classic: the vegetable dumplings were superb. The broth was especially excellent with notes of celery. - the ""sushi"" with kalamata olives was well balanced and well executed. I appreciate that the chef took into consideration my dislike for cheese and provided this dish instead. - the squash soup with the sage whipped cream was excellent. The texture was silky smooth and buttery. I would have liked nice quenelle of cream rather than a rustic looking scoop. - the leek and pear with a very interesting dish. The associate worked perfectly. The note of pepper on top were what needed to elevate this dish. The leeks provided some welcome mache. - The quenelle of scallop and truffle was a surprise since I was expecting only vegetable. It was delicious nonetheless. The parsnip? and truffle cream was again silky smooth and the crunch of the fresh truffles balanced this very well. - The beet tartare, another classic was on point and the mustard carrot condiment worked so well with it. A great dish. - the final savory dish was my least favorite of all. While I was impressed by the cooking of each winter vegetable, the sweet and sour sauce was not to my liking. The buttery taste was too overpowering for me. - the hazelnut souffle was great. A great balanced of nutty and smooth chocolate flavors. - another classic, sweet this time. the flower apple tarte. Great touch of tartness here and there and nice puff pastry. The caramel was unexpectedly sour.  - the plate of migniardises was well assorted. The vanilla whisky macarons will be remembered.  The small size of the room and the large and necessary numbers of staff make the dining room feel cramped and crowded at all time. The constant back and forth of the staff (again necessary) made us difficult for us to stay focused on the food and conversation. Would we have been seated at the different table (other than the little square table behind the entrance) it might have been different. This will be difficult to improve because it is due to the size of the dining room.  The staff was professional and understanding at all time. However, service is the area that could use some improvements. - I made a 12pm reservation but the door was closed at noon and opened 4-5 min later. - The waitress who greeted us at our table had a stained on her jacket lapel. That should not happen at the beginning of a service. - We chose the vegetable lunch menu. We explained that we were not ""heavy"" drinkers and that we would go with wine by the glass. Since we did not know what we will be eating, we asked for recommendations and the answer we got was that people usually go with white. We were a bit surprised back the lack of depth of the answer. - The choice given for aperitif was not large. Since we declined champagne (because we do not like bubbly wine and I will come back to that) we were provided with only one option: a glass of chardonnay. We decided to give it a little bit of thought. Once my spouse returned from the restrooms, the waitress asked us if we were ready for our glass of wine. It felt that we did not have other choice than to accept it. That was a bit pushy - We appreciate that one of our waiters asked about the pace of the meal we would like to adopt. We gladly enjoy the little wait between dishes. The overall experience lasted for four hours and did not feel like it. It was well paced. - My wife being American, the staff talked to us in English. Hearing the descriptions of the dishes and other interactions with customers, I found out that we missed on numerous details. Should we come back, we will ask for the French version and I will translate for my wife. - Coming back to the champagne, when the bill was given to us, I noticed that a glass of champagne was mistakenly charged instead of an aperitif wine. While we appreciate the commercial gesture of offering us the water, we should be able to trust such establishment to get the bill right without having to check it. However, I am glad I did.  The menu was reasonably priced with outstanding produce and impeccable attention to detail. The extra like coffee and water were quite expensive. The pours of wine or digestives could be a bit more generous. I went to similar establishments outside Paris, where generosity was of primary importance. Unfortunately, it seems that it is a trait of province and not Paris. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r925557870-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,4,en
2023-08-24,Loulwa_Kaloyeros (Assaker),"I was treated to an amazing experience on my 60th birthday. This was a memorable lunch from start to finish. We opted for the surprise lunch menu of 11 dishes and added a main - we had the Dover sole and the sweetbreads. We spent over 3 hours being entertained with one dish after the other of utter delight and deliciousness. All the plates were full of flavor, pieces of art and an ode to vegetables. We also had several iconic dishes such as the egg which has been on the menu for 37 years! How can an egg be so tasty?? We also had the beetroot tatare with its condiments. And since tomatoes and lovage are in season, the gaspacho, minestrone (with eel) and the sushi exposed the elegance of this fruit. The highlight of the dessert was the chocolate millefeuille. In 60 years I have never seen this baked to perfection. It was sublime. A gastronomic delight. Everything was served with a lot of elegance - the staff balanced professionalism with a sweet human touch. The sommelier was such an expert (lots of natural wines) who catered to our desires. The finale was a beautiful plate of sweets and tarts that we asked to take home. The whole experience was remarkable. And yes maybe the restaurant is small but it felt very intimate. The sounds from the kitchen audible as the doors opened but this also made the experience genuine. Yes it is expensive but for a 3 star Parisian restaurant of this calibre a lunch menu for 185 € is really a great deal (eleven dishes!). Thank you Alain Passard for giving vegetables a royal treatment and for tantalizing our palates with amazing French produce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r912656878-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,5,en

2023-07-04,nick164,"Arriving on a drizzly Parisian winter's evening 5 minutes before my reservation time, I found the door locked. A staff member looked blanky through the window before finally opening the door. Having advised them I had a reservation they then indicated they were not yet open and left me on the street until 731pm. An appalling initial impression, noting this is not a hotel restaurant with a pleasant foyer to wait.   If I knew what was to come, I would have just left.   The decor is pleasant. The dining room felt quite crowded, with the table being located next to the busy kitchen and its squeaky door. Dietary and allergy requirements provided at the time of booking were forgotten. Whilst the majority of dinners were English speaking, the menu is still not available in English. And most disappointingly for this once renowned vegetarian restaurant is that the menu no longer even has a vegetarian selection.  Having opted for the 5-course, the waiter initially continued a 'hard sell' for the 12-course before just proceeding to outline his favourite dishes that could be adapted as vegetarian. On enquiring on a degustation, the Sommelier just thrust a menu and advised they don't offer one. I requested 3 wines by the glass to match the 5 courses.  The recommended wines were ok, but the supposed Sommelier's abilities were poor. Having recommended a wine, it arrived with the very limited introduction of ""this is a Sauvignon Blanc"" before just walking off - there was a little improvement over time but not much.  In terms of the food: - No butter or olive oil was provided with the bread. - The amuse bouche was nice, but being advised to stir it would have made the difference. - The first course of dumplings was very tasty. - The second course of onion gratin with truffle smelled good but was effectively a plate of onion with shaved truffle and greenery atop. - The third course of beet tartar was very nice. - The fourth course of leek and truffle was, similar to the onion, a plate of leek just hidden under some truffle. - The fifth course was a plate of favourless vegetables in a sauce.   The 'cheese board' was a block of Comte. Bizarrely for a tasting course, all courses were savoury - with dessert then being an additional cost. Dessert options then proposed included those I was allergic too.  Service was poor. There are lots of staff, yet most plates went uncleared for some time. I failed to finish multiple dishes yet only on the last did the waiter enquire. Upon asking for the bill, the waiter advised the fifth course would be deducted.  Most definitely not recommended. I visit Paris a couple of times a year and I will not be back to Arpege. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d718128-r900393895-L_Arpege-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,2,en
2023-06-20,RYOKO,"I went there for lunch (set menu) and found this famous clearly overrated. The place has two levels. Downstairs is litterally the basement with no window so very claustrophobic. We were initially downstairs but we asked for a table upstairs and fortunately we managed to get one. Already better but the place is so small that we ended up being not far to the kitchen door, which is obviously disruptive. In terms of service, except for the somelier, everybody was extraordinarily snooty. The female maitre d' is was a caricature of what American tourists dread in Paris. The food is certainly sophisticated, almost excessively, with too much emphasis on style and not enough on substance. In summary, a disappointing, if not painful, experience, obviously made worse by the overpiced bill. Avoid.

2024-01-19,Coastal34348810760,"Despite playfully poking fun at the traditional Dutch eating habits, my dining experience over the past year has been nothing short of extraordinary. When my husband mentioned that De Nieuwe Winkel in Nijmegen was crowned the Best Vegetable Restaurant in the World two years in a row by We're Smart, I knew that I had to experience it for myself. We took a spontaneous detour, canceling our reservation at L'Arpège in Paris for our anniversary dinner to savor the flavors of Chef Emile van der Staak's Botanical Gastronomy. Tucked away in the former Catholic orphanage of Nijmegen, finding this hidden gem added an extra layer of adventure to our evening. Chef Emile's dedication to showcasing the best of Dutch ingredients amazed us. Nearly everything sourced locally, from Food Forest Ketelbroek to Ommuurde Tuin, Bodemzicht, and even green tea from Brabant. It's a true celebration of eating local taken to the next level. In Chef Emile's words, ""Once nature has done its work, it is our turn. We pick. Smell. Taste. Analyze. Ferment. Cook. Until there is something on your plate that amazes and overwhelms you."" Our enthusiasm for tasting the custom-made botanical drink pairings led to an exclusive tour of their lab. Witnessing the craftsmanship behind the scenes, from cheese to tempe, nukazuke, and all the botanical drinks, was an eye-opening experience. De Nieuwe Winkel is not just a restaurant; it's a culinary sanctuary where nature's bounty is transformed into art on your plate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188569-d2430614-r934701823-De_Nieuwe_Winkel-Nijmegen_Gelderland_Province.html,5,en
2023-10-07,DutchAlfred,"Let's start with the positive: the food is innovative and brings you a complete new range of flavours. And the service in general is on spot, yet informal.  Now the flipside: I did not like certain dishes, which can happen. But no one asks how the dish was when they clear it, and when I told them that I did not like a dish, the only question was 'Shall I then clear it?' I would have expected that if you don't like two or three dishes (and they are all a surprise for you) that you offer an alternative. Or at least a free coffee at the end. But nothing. When I raised this to the chef/owner, he told me that this did not fit in his cooking process and that he actually was not interested in his clients' feedback on the dishes. Which I find really odd for a 2-Michelin star restaurant with these prices. I told him I felt dissatisfied with my restaurant visit and he let me go.

2023-01-08,maaikepypekamp,"We went to De Nieuwe Winkel in December with a party of 4. We opted for the 9-course menu and added an extra ""cheese platter"" dish. All of the dishes, even for well-seasoned vegans, were surprising in that many were unrecognisable with unique appearances and tastes. The sunflower butter and accompanying crackers, for example, were delicious. The use of unusual ingredients such as a local lemongrass and Kliswortel is admirable.  However, several dishes were also disappointing: the coiled cabbage (with silky tofu) and the (undercooked?) leek (in the superb Spirulina algae broth) were stringy and tough to break down; the ""chocolate"" desert was very oily; and the vegan cheese dish wrapped in vine leaves was rather distasteful; and the “risotto” was too rich. The wine pairing was OK (the smoked white wine is perhaps an acquired taste) and the non-alcohol version is to be recommended with unusual tastes. The service is very extravagant with waiters calling out dishes in unison and a bit over the top obsequiousness.

But then you will enjoy super fine, clean, bio, wild, creatively prepared, steamed, roasted, fermented, extracted, squeezed, mandolinized, and what have you, dishes you never tasted before. Wines and beers: same.  But as there is no price list for the drinks, no written indication of what there is (and be sure: a great abundancy there is) you could be tempted to ask for a price indication. Do. It is OK, not exaggerated. With the menu there comes a standard water service, bubble and still, for 7 € unlimited refill per 2 menus, at least that I extracted from the bill. A six course dinner, amuse bouche and bread comes to € 100.- Be surprised also of the drinks, alcoholic and home prepared astonishing non-alcohol drinks.  Super staff, great knowledge.

I have been to a reasonable number of Michelin star restaurants, but this one was extraordinary. As I told a friend, they have umami in buckets. I honestly had no idea you could create such rich, complex flavors without meat. The dark fermented garlic should be exhibit one.  I mentioned to the chef that I had no idea what you could achieve with fermentation and pan searing.

We chose the 6-course surprise menu with wine pairing. We got 6 tiny courses, with barely anything to eat in each of them, from a tiny piece of pumpkin to a tiny piece of leek. Luckily the bread was nice otherwise I would have had to have an actual dinner when coming back home. Out of the 6 wines, 2 were some kind of beers that have nothing to do in this pairing. Tasteless, very sour and extremely disappointing. The dessert was the cherry on the cake, although I wish there had been actual cake and cherry. Hay ice cream sandwich between two hay cookies. Maybe it's very original and unique but come on. So, we paid 240 euros for 2 for a disappointing very light dinner. But hey, it's hype to be vegetarian, right?

We could choose between meet (chicken), fish or vegetarian menu.  Because we had some appetite we choose the 6 courses menu with fish. You get something different comparing to other fancy places. We choose fish, so you expect some fish. One of the starters had a bit of fish in it and that was it. The main course was a tasty piece of a carrot (but then purple) and the second main course some beet. Loved the dessert most. A tasty appel and a nice vegie cheesecake variation. We had a nice evening, but at the end we had to laugh about it.  If we would go here with our parents they would call us crazy. 160 euro for a petit carrot and beet as main-course. Ridiculous.

2018-04-03,E M,"Lluernas is a dining experience. A very special one. The service was perfect and the food was just as good.   We opted for the tasting menu (and added a cheese course as well). Each course was delicious and more interesting than the next, with a personal favourite of mine being a take on beef wellington with celeriac (see photos). There was also a very detailed description of each course.  The restaurant is located in santa Coloma, and you wouldn’t necessarily know it’s there (or so good) unless you knew. It’s worth taking the metro to have a try. The bill came to around 200 EUR including wine, really reasonable for what it was.   The atmosphere is calm and relaxed, not in any way stuffy as I expected it to be to be honest. We felt welcome and didn’t feel we were being forced out the door (even if we were the last to leave). Overall, we spent a very special 3 hours in lluernas and I look forward to doing it again soon!  There’s also a tapas bar next door (same owners) which I’ll be paying a visit to very soon!

Service was prompt and good and at the beginning we were told if we wanted to knew what was being served or just let every dish be a surprise. We chose the latter and had an enjoyable time. The waitress, at times couldn't find the English words to introduce the dishes but we are happy still, to let our taste buds do the work.

The service on our arrival was immaculate as always. This time, however, the waiter had a tad too much school-teacher-esque attitude by our waiter celebrating himself and the fact that we could not receive our meals as ordered but they would bring them out ""family style"" whenever they had them ready. Please do not get me wrong: we loved the family style. The way it was presented to us: not so much. As I said: I've been a dozen or more times, never with a party of six though.  The six of us loved our entrées pizza and pasta (and when I say we loved we really really loved them) - however, our starters were rather meh - the BURRATA E PESCHE was not creamy at all and the POLIPO ALLA BRACE was more of a black bean salad with two small pieces of ""grilled octopus"" that was underwhelmingly ""un-crisp"" - we did not eat it, and no one cared.

Something more is going on here. That aside, the accompanying sauce and ingredients were mouth wateringly delicious 😋  I actually feel like I’ve just properly experienced great pasta for the very first time!  We started our meal with a swordfish kebab. This was expertly cooked, succulent and very tasty. I could’ve eaten another plate, it was so good! There was not a free table in the house.

Perhaps things are different since COVID but the quality of the food was just not there. The stuffed squash blossoms are still a perfect appetizer, but I thought they were over-salted. The wonderful pizzas, from what I remember in the past, this time had a gooey-like consistency to the dough and also tasted soggy. Our pastas fared better though I thought the tagliatelle was overcooked and the orchiette dish is much better at Mozza. I also think the new prices on the menu are very steep. $30+ for a pizza or pasta dish is just very steep. Overall, the service was very good and the patio was a nice option for pleasant summer evening but the noise level was quite loud and it really wasn't necessary to also have the music on at the same time. It was difficult to hear my dinner colleagues across the table. I've had some really wonderful meals at Felix in the past.

We had two salads and three pasta dishes to share. Note- for 3 people that was quite alot of food. Add the famous olive oil and herbed bread as a starter and you’ll be full for days. The service was great. The servers are all very well trained and recite the menu like pros. I must point out one exceptional staff member and that is Megan the bar manager/director. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine list, which is crazy extensive and expensive, but when you pay $32 for a bowl of pasta what’s a $74 bottle of excellent Pinot noir? My one slightly negative comment would be Felix’s rigidity. You must put in your entire order at once and they don’t do any substitutions. They also limit your dining time. My party of 3 had two hours to eat and drink and when we were over by about 20 minutes we were given our check and gently told there was another reservation waiting. Felix has become a Venice staple and if you want excellent pasta from an excellent chef, go and check it out.

And they properly include a 3% surcharge to provide medical insurance for their staff! A classy move that I love!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r814358626-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,5,en
2021-08-15,Anthony Kjenstad,"OMG!  Best Italian food I have had in a while…maybe since Italy!  Heirloom Tomato Salad to start(sorry they call it something else) but wow. The tomatoes were amazing, the burrata cheese was fresh!  Had a Diovola pizza for appetizer-yum  Wife and I shared two pasta dishes.  We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r804149249-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,5,en
2021-08-07,GioG1727,"I am Italian and I was lucky enough to visit some of the best restaurant beside my home, in Italy and around the world. I am from the region where the chef of Felix was trained at least on the home-making pasta. A friend of mine wanted me to try this one and here are my comments: Ambiance: I didn’t see the inside as we had the reservation outside in the patio. The patio though was pretty basic (simple wood table and simple light bulbs across the ceiling). I don’t know if this was done in a hurry to accommodate customers while in the middle of the Covid crisis. Food: we had 3 flutes of champagne, 3 appetizers (antipasti), 2 pizzas and 3 pastas (primi). The highlight were the Zucchini Ripieni, lightly fried almost tempura style. Then it went downhill pretty fast from there. The Polpette were salty (mortadella e parmigiano overpowering) and the fincione was more like a maritozzo romano (sweet) than a real fincione. What is the hype about this bread is beyond me. It shouldn’t be sweet. Appetizers didn’t arrive at the same time, my Polpette landed when the other antipasti were finished. Not good! The pizzas arrived warm and the outside (cornicione) was chewy while the inside mushy. It sounded like rewarmed. Not good at all. I Primi: i Rigatoni all’amatriciana were undercooked and I know what al-dente should be like. They are missing 2 minutes in the water. The rest, a Cacio e Pepe and the Pappardelle al Ragu’ pretty normal (Everybody knows how to cook Italian could do the same – read the Artusi book). 3 glass of wine at the price of gold, a Tiramisu too sweet and another desert that my wife had with an ice-cream uneventful (she didn’t finish it). I think it was a tart. Man oh man it was low. The service: too many servers stepping on each other toes. We had probably 5-6 people working our table. Really! The timing: you feel that the whole menu is built around fast and easy to make or pre-prepared dishes to get people out of the door within the allotted time and for the price they are asking it is just shameful. Had I spent $120 for the whole meal it would have been a non-event, flat meal but still a nonevent, but for $600 hell no. I would have had no problem to spend that kind of money for an excellent quality meal but not for this. I can do way better myself at home and that was the most disappointing things. There was nothing special about this meal. Any trattoria in Emilia-Romagna and maybe a bunch of Italian restaurants in LA would do the same if not better for a fifth of the price. People giving 5 stars to this restaurant, I guess, either were eating Italian for the first time or they were there more for the hype of the restaurant and/or had money to waste. Of course there is no point in going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r802334185-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,2,en
2021-05-18,TheFunFoodie,Felix is fabulous.  The service is A++.  They have a beautiful outdoor dining area ... one of the best in town.  And the food is incredible!  The pizza is wonderful.  We also loved the burrata.  And the desserts are amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r789183378-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,5,en
2020-11-08,Shanelle,"Perennially popular Italian restaurant on Abbot Kinney known for handmade pastas. This is a good spot for special occasions or a date night. They’re currently open during covid for outdoor dining on their patio; reservations can be made up to 7 days in advance, and for a party of four, are available in 2 hour increments. Cards are accepted, masks are required, and parking will suck because it’s in Venice, but you might get lucky and find a residential parking spot if you’re there early enough.   Food wise, everything is delicious. The servers will recommend you get 6-8 dishes for a party of four, but I think those with lighter appetites could easily do with 4-5 dishes. The plates may look small, but the food is super filling. Here’s the lowdown on what we got:  Sfcionne: round bread baked with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh herbs. A lot of people on Yelp seemed to recommend it; glad I tried it for the first time, but it’s not necessary.   Pizze Calabrese: there’s quite a few pizza options, and no one can ever say no. They cut the pizza into quarters and the dough was delicious. The ‘nduja was spicy and the cheese was slightly sweet.   Tagliatelle: a must-get and one of the most popular pastas. The pasta was chewy and covered in a silky ragu - hands down the table’s favorite  Rigatoni: large and al dente, the guanciale seemed a bit clumped together but it was a solid pasta.   Busiate: personally my second favorite; it had crushed almonds and I really enjoyed the fatness of the pasta. The cherry tomatoes were fresh and burst into bright flavors in your mouth.   Orecchiette: good to get for meat lovers, as it comes with plenty of sausage.   Budino: creamy and only slightly sweet - it’s comes with a cloud of whipped cream on top that’s almost like a marscapone cheese   Overall, a really delicious meal - it’s easy to see why this is a super popular restaurant on the West Side.

2020-10-28,Ivan K,"Our group visits LA restaurants that are highlighted in critics reviews and articles.  Although we don’t always totally agree, mostly they are valuable and on the mark.  We were excited to try out Felix given its high ratings. Maybe this was an aberration but it was not at all impressive and in fact quite disappointing in many respects. We all at first gave it good, but I think it was because it was pricey and we hated to say otherwise as we would feel a little foolish.  But as the evening went on, each of us had some negative comments.        First, the food took awhile to come out and it did sporadically with our mains separated by 10 minutes or so, to a point where we encouraged each other to eat before it got cold.  A few orders were forgotten all together with apologies by the waitress.       Now to the food. The focaccia was warm, fragrant, chewy and delicious, although a little less olive oil on top would be better.  The zucchini blossoms were the highlight of the meal.  The meatballs were recommended but there were so salty to a point that   the meat was hard to taste.  My ragu bolognes was so salty that I could only eat half.  Again the pesto on my wife’s dish was lip puckering.  The porcini pasta dish was “ good” according to my friend and the other pastas were given very good marks.       The desserts were again good but not memorable.  The other unusual aspect is they do not allow you to bring wine and when you review the extensive Italian wine list, you will be hard pressed to find any bottle under $100.  When checked with the Delectable app on my phone, the markup on their wines are around 3 times retail, again a little pricey.  Which leads me to my objection which is overall the prices are just very high.  You will find the average pasta dish is around $33 and although hand made.  We have been to many of the highly rated Italian restaurants in many cities and for the money as well as the food, I can not recommend dining here.  I feel badly saying that, but I do feel it’s justified at least with our experience tonight.  Again, maybe it was an aberration but I feel salt is put heavily on food to mask a weakness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d12417682-r775908824-Felix-Los_Angeles_California.html,2,en
