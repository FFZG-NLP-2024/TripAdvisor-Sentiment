The level of agreement in the data was calculated using a relatively simple metric based on the fraction of annotators who agreed on the most common label for each sentence. Step-by-Step Calculation of the Agreement Level:1. Extract Ratings:o For each sentence, the annotations were extracted from columns containing ratings by multiple annotators (e.g., Sentiment (sentence) 1 through Sentiment (sentence) 5).2. Convert to Numeric Values:o Each rating, which might have been represented as a string (e.g., "5 (positive)"), was converted to a numeric value (e.g., 5). This was done by splitting the string and extracting the number.3. Identify the Most Common Label:o Using the numeric ratings, the most common rating (label) was determined among the annotators for each sentence.4. Count the Frequency:o The frequency of the most common rating was counted to determine how many annotators agreed on this label.5. Calculate the Fraction of Agreement:Example Calculation:Consider a scenario where five annotators rated a sentence, and the ratings were:* 5, 5, 4, 5, 4* Step 1: Extract ratings ? [5, 5, 4, 5, 4]* Step 2: Identify the most common label ? 5* Step 3: Count the frequency of the most common label ? 3 occurrences of 5* Step 4: Calculate the agreement level ? 3\5= 0.653?=0.6 or 60%Interpretation:* An agreement level of 0.6 means 60% of annotators agreed on the most common sentiment label for that sentence.Data Summary for Review 1* review_index: All rows have review_index 1, indicating they are part of the same review.* Sentence Agreement: The column shows the level of agreement among annotators for each sentence's sentiment rating.Interpretation of the Key Calculations1. Sentence-Level Agreement (Sentence_Agreement):o This value represents the fraction of annotators who agreed on the most common sentiment label for a sentence.o For instance, a value of 0.8 indicates 80% agreement among annotators, while a value of 1 means perfect agreement.o Sentences with lower agreement values, such as 0.8, indicate less consensus among the annotators on the sentiment.2. Paragraph-Level Agreement (Paragraph_Agreement):o This value averages the sentence-level agreements within the entire review (paragraph) to get a measure of overall agreement among annotators for all sentences combined in that review.o Here, the value for all sentences is 0.945454545, suggesting that there is a high average agreement level among annotators for this review as a whole.3. Agreement Difference (Agreement_Difference):o This value represents the difference between the agreement level for each sentence and the overall paragraph-level agreement.o Positive values (e.g., 0.054545455) indicate that the agreement for that particular sentence is higher than the average agreement for the review.o Negative values (e.g., -0.145454545) indicate that the agreement for that sentence is lower than the average paragraph-level agreement.Example Sentences:* Sentences with High Agreement (e.g., Sentence_Agreement = 1):o These sentences have perfect agreement among all annotators, showing strong consensus on their sentiment rating.* Sentences with Moderate Agreement (e.g., Sentence_Agreement = 0.8):o These sentences show some level of disagreement among annotators. For instance, a 0.8 value suggests that only 80% of the annotators agreed on the sentiment rating.Overall Interpretation for Review 1:* The paragraph (Review 1) has an overall high average agreement (0.945), indicating strong overall annotator consensus on the sentiment of the review sentences.* Some sentences have lower agreement values (e.g., 0.8), suggesting possible ambiguity or differing interpretations among annotators.* Positive and negative values in Agreement_Difference help highlight which sentences align more or less with the overall review agreement level.1. Your Current Calculations:o The Sentence_Agreement values in your data represent the fraction of annotators who agreed on the most common label for each sentence. This is a simpler measure of agreement and does not take chance agreement into account.o This approach is useful for a quick, intuitive view of agreement but does not provide the statistical rigor of a Kappa score.Example Difference:* If you have five annotators rating a sentence, and four agree on a label, yielding 0.8 agreement, this does not factor in the probability that such agreement might happen by random chance.* In contrast, Cohen’s Kappa would adjust for such random chance agreement, often resulting in a lower score than the simple proportion of agreement.Limitations:* This method is simpler and more intuitive but does not account for chance agreement, unlike statistical measures like Cohen's Kappa.* It only focuses on the agreement around the most frequent label and does not consider disagreement or partial agreement among annotators.Interpretation of the Metric:* The metric reflects the proportion of annotators who agreed on the most frequent rating relative to the total number of valid ratings.* For example, an agreement level of 0.6 (or 60%) means that 60% of the annotators selected the most common label for a given sentence. This tells you how consistently annotators agree on a particular sentiment label for that sentence.Strengths of the Metric:1. Easy to Understand: This method is simple to calculate and easy to interpret, providing a direct view of how often annotators agree.2. Quick Insight into Consensus: It gives an immediate sense of whether there is substantial agreement or if the ratings are widely dispersed across different values.3. Usefulness in Early Analysis: It can be helpful as a first-pass assessment of agreement, useful for identifying areas where annotators have low consensus.Limitations of the Metric:1. No Chance Agreement Correction: Unlike statistical measures such as Cohen’s Kappa or Fleiss’ Kappa, this metric does not account for the possibility that some agreement may occur by chance. Measures like Kappa are more stringent because they discount expected random agreement, providing a more robust estimate of true agreement.2. Ignores Minority Consensus: This metric only focuses on the most frequent label and ignores the distribution of other ratings. For example, if 3 out of 5 annotators agree on one label while the other 2 consistently select another label, this partial consensus among the minority group is disregarded.3. Insensitive to Near-Agreement: If most annotators choose ratings that are close to each other (e.g., 5 and 4), the metric does not reflect the proximity of ratings. It only counts direct matches.4. Limited Expressiveness: Unlike more advanced measures, this approach cannot provide insight into the strength or weakness of agreement across multiple levels of rating granularity.When Is This Metric Okay to Use?* For Quick Consensus Checks: It can be useful for getting a sense of overall agreement in simple, small-scale datasets or for gaining a quick understanding of where disagreements may exist.* For Initial Stages of Annotation Projects: When starting an annotation project, this metric can highlight areas where annotators may need further training or more detailed guidelines.* If Complexity Isn’t Required: In situations where a high level of precision isn’t necessary (e.g., informal reviews or basic exploratory analysis), this metric might suffice.When You Might Need a More Robust Measure:* If you need to account for chance agreement or want to assess the strength of agreement (not just frequency), statistical measures like Cohen’s Kappa (for two raters) or Fleiss’ Kappa (for multiple raters) would be more appropriate.* If there is value in understanding partial agreement or comparing inter-annotator reliability in depth, a more advanced measure is beneficial.
